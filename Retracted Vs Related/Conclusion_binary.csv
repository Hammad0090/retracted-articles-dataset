"In summary, this work has presented a novel compound, YL-0919, acting as both serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Such pharmacological profile of dual functions may account for its antidepressant-like activity demonstrated in animal models. Future studies are needed to further assess the feasibility of its clinical application in eliciting an efficacious antidepressant response in patients.",0
"Through the means of a systematic review and a focused
meta-analysis, this study reveals that human adults born
preterm have a reduced VO2max and FEV1 independent of
physical activity levels. Consequently, in adults born preterm, exercise interventions may result in a lower beneft
compared with adults born at term, and additional therapeutic interventions or higher exercise intensities/volumes
may be required.

"Concluding Remarks

This study was designed to investigate the hand movement effects on visual word recognition and ERP neural correlates of handwriting effect among L2 learners. The finding that drawing lines/shapes enhances word recognition should be further investigated in future research as our previous study (
Guan et al., 2021b
) showing facilitative effects of drawing straight line on Chinese character recognition and curved-line on English word recognition among typical and dyslexic readers. Moreover, future research should employ various methodologies to examine whether and to what extent hand writing and drawing affect orthographic perception in other bilingual and monolingual groups. For instance, neural correlates of age of acquisition on visual word recognition in L2 learners. Based on the findings of the current study, it is reasonable to argue that writing, as a basic manual sensorimotor skill, directly influences the way in which knowledge of words is acquired (
Van-Hove et al., 2017
). Modes of writing are at the core of human learning. They have a profound influence on learners’ cognitive and language development (
Mangen and Velay, 2010
). The current study further demonstrates the impact of perceptual experiences and sensorimotor interactions with the physical environment on language processing, consistent with theories of embodied cognition (
Smith and Gasser, 2005
).",0
"According to the study’s findings, adult smokers experience vertigo more than non-smokers. Additionally, demographic characteristics have been demonstrated to have a major impact on vertigo, necessitating a discussion of these issues. We anticipate that this study will highlight the need for additional research in the areas of smoking prevention and treatment, as well as the demographic characteristics and their impact on vertigo. Moreover, we need to have health promotion and smoking cessation programs and awareness about the risk of smoking",0
"Within its limitations, the present study concludes that better dentin wettability is seen with Tubli-seal compared to BC sealer. The contact angle was lesser between dentin and sealers used in the root canal for the remaining calcium hydroxide samples. Also, calcium hydroxide can be removed from the polished dentin surface with two minutes of irrigation with 17% EDTA and 6% NaOCl. The limitations of the present study were single-assessment time and a smaller number of included samples, warranting more long-term studies on a greater number of samples.",0

"Conclusions
Considering that green innovation and digital transformation are important ways to achieve carbon peaking and
carbon neutrality in China, this paper uses 452 high energy-consuming listed enterprises as a research sample
and uses a double fxed-efects model to explore the impact efect of green innovation on the carbon emission
reduction performance of high energy-consuming enterprises and the moderating efect of digital transformation. Te fndings show that, frstly, green innovation has a positive efect on the level of carbon emission reduction performance of high energy-consuming enterprises, and the results are robust when tested by endogeneity,
standard error clustering bias and dynamic panel selection bias. Secondly, digital transformation can improve
the contribution of green innovation to the carbon emission reduction performance of high energy-consuming
enterprises. Tird, the heterogeneity of the impact of digital transformation on the relationship between green
innovation and the carbon emission reduction performance of energy-intensive enterprises is due to the differences in the characteristics of industries. Te impact of green innovation and digital transformation on the
processing industry is not yet evident.",0

"We observed an increased probability of a favorable discharge disposition with EVT versus BMM for
patients with BAO and mild neurological deficits in this
representative database of US patients. The higher
rate of favorable discharge with EVT (as a surrogate

null difference in in-hospital mortality and hospitalization duration. However, based on the limitations of the

In order to mitigate the risk for virological failure, it is important to perform targeted clinical assessments and
examinations at every ART clinic visit to identify early clinical signs or symptoms of virological failure. In addition,
it is important that regular education sessions about the risk of virological failure should be provided at each clinic

"This scoping review shows that CBT intervention is one of interventions carried out
by nurses to reduce PTSD symptoms in children who are victims of violence. There are
three methods in the CBT intervention, namely psychoeducation, self-management, and
counseling. CBT interventions have been shown to reduce negative emotional and behavioral responses in children, increase resilience, adaptive coping, stress management, and
increase self-confidence. CBT interventions carried out by nurses must pay attention to the
physical, psychological, spiritual, and cultural conditions of students to optimally reduce
PTSD symptoms in children. Each intervention was adjusted to the characteristics and
severity of the trauma experienced by the respondent. CBT intervention can be the basis for
nurses in providing comprehensive nursing intervention to children as victims of violence.
The results of this study can also be the basis for further research to analyze the effectiveness
of CBT interventions in managing other symptoms that arise due to violence in children",0
"The current study provides evidence for the potential neuroprotective effect of ipriflavone
through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities (Fig 9). Data presented in this study shows that; Ipriflavone (50mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80 ameliorated LPS
induced brain inflammation of adult male rats. The neuroprotective effects of ipriflavone can
be accredited to its anti-inflammatory effect, its ability in alleviating oxidative stress and anticholinesterase effect (Fig 9). Polysorbate 80, possesses high BBB permeability thus, it can be
used for effective brain targeting in neurodegenerative diseases.
It is reasonable to deem that ipriflavone nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 at dose
equivalent to 5mg/kg significantly attenuated LPS-induced brain inflammation whereas free
drug at same dose (5mg/kg) didn’t show the same effect against LPS induction of neuroinflammation. This may be considered as a significant improvement in attenuating neuroinflammation using nanoparticles by decreasing the dose ten times the effective therapeutic dose of free
drug (50 mg/kg) while showing better biochemical results. However, further studies to consider it as a drug delivery system is required.",0

"In conclusion, in this observational study, we found that non-operative management in children for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in selected cases is a safe and effective treatment method. Based on our findings, we propose that the success rate of non-operative management for clinically and radiologically proven acute appendicitis cases could be improved by applying two significant treatment criteria, i.e., less than 24 hours of symptom duration and fever-free at the time of admission.

"We have established herein that, due to the evolving boundary layer and the corresponding area blockage in the
upstream port of any internal nanofuid fow system with sudden expansion or divergent region, the creeping
diabatic nanofow (Mi< <1) originated from the upstream port of the system could accelerate to the supersonic
fow leading to an undesirable phenomenon of pressure-overshoot due to shock wave generation as a result of
the Sanal fow choking. Trough the proposed mathematical methodology, we could disprove the general belief
of the impossibilities of internal fow choking in such real-world nanoscale fuid fow systems at the creeping
infow conditions. Tere was a general belief in the scientifc community over the centuries that the subsonic/
creeping fow would not be augmented up to supersonic fow without passing through a geometric throat, which
we have disproved herein through the closed-form analytical model. Note that if the total-to-static pressure ratio
at the fuid-throat is lower than the LCDI the detonation would not occur even if the blockage factor is relatively
high in nanoscale fuid fow systems. Te physical insight of the nanoscale Sanal fow choking and streamtube
fow choking14 presented in this article sheds light on fnding solutions to numerous unresolved scientifc problems carried forward over the centuries. We concluded that the 3D-boundary-layer-blockage factors presented
herein are universal-benchmark-data for performing high-fdelity in silico, in vitro and in vivo experiments in

"Based on the electric load dispatching model, this paper further considers the dispatching value of heat load
participating in demand response, and establishes an electric-heat integrated demand response model. In order
to verify the validity of the proposed electrothermal comprehensive demand response model, three diferent cases
were set up for simulation comparison analysis. At the same time, in order to verify the superiority of IGWO, the
simulation comparison analysis was carried out with traditional GWO and IPSO, and the results showed that:
(1) When only considering the electric-heat substitution response, the system can cut peaks and fll valleys
within a certain range, but the operating cost is high and the utilization rate of new energy is low.(2) When considering the dispatcher’s expected signal and electric load response, the system can achieve peak
shaving and valley flling, and appropriately increase the electric load demand when the heat demand is
large at night, which can improve the accommodation level of new energy.
(3) When considering the integrated electric and heat demand response of the dispatcher’s desired signal, the
operating cost of the system can be reduced to a greater extent, the utilization rate of new energy can be
improved, and the benign interaction between the source and the load can be promoted.
(4) IGWO can improve the defect of insufcient population diversity in the later stage of evolution, so that
the population diversity can be better maintained during the entire evolution process. While taking into
account the speed of optimization, it improves the algorithm’s ability to jump out of the local optimum and
realizes continuous deep search.
Since the uncertainty on both sides of the source-load afects the reliability and economy of the system
operation, the integrated demand response of the system under multiple uncertainties will be considered in the
subsequent research work.",0
"This meta-analysis is the first to synthesize research on associations between the ERI model and markers of the HPA axis. The
CAR and waking cortisol assessments were most associated
with ERI, whereas cortisol in the afternoon and evening was most
associated with OC, although prospective evidence is required to
confirm these associations. Both ERI and OC were significantly
associated with HPA responsivity. However, because OC moderated the relationship between ERI and HPA axis markers, the importance of OC should not be overlooked. Because OC is likely
more malleable than ERI to intervention, this may be a promising
area of focus for future research. Furthermore, when we consider
that much research has shown the imbalance between workplace
efforts and rewards leads to ill-health, and that the current metaanalysis reports an association between ERI and indicators of
HPA axis dysregulation, altering the structural components of the
workplace that lead to ERI may result in improved employee health.",0

"Advanced laparoscopic training is difficult to come by in a developing nation like India. As a result, approaches with a low learning curve should be used in a variety of advanced laparoscopic operations. We believe that Hem-o-lok® will be a simpler procedure for novices to master, saving operating time. Hem-o-lok® is statistically cheaper than ENDOLOOP®, according to a cost comparison assessment and Hem-o-lok® surgery took less time on average. There were no intra-operative or post-operative problems in the Hem-o-lok® group. Hence, we advocate the use of Hem-o-lok® as a safe, simpler and cost-effective way to ligate an appendicular stump in uncomplicated laparoscopic appendicectomy.

Co3O4 nanoparticles composite was synthesized and used as
an anode material in LIBs. The prepared Co3O4@MnO2 electrode delivered a capacity of 1080 mAh g−1
 at 300 mA g−1
 after
160 cycles and 696 mAh g−1
 at 1 A g−1
 after 210 cycles. The high
energy density, excellent structural stability, and outstanding
electrochemical performance of this composite electrode were
ascribed to the unique structure and the synergetic effect of the
two metal oxides. This work will be of benefit to the design and
controllable synthesis of high-performance LIBs with metaloxide-based electrode materials in the future.",0

"Iron deficiency is common in mothers with PPD who, by
appearance, have normal hemoglobin and serum iron levels
after delivery. Early iron supplementation in these mothers
significantly improves the status of iron stores and causes
a significant reduction in EPDS scores, as well as a significant increase in the improvement rate for PPD. In addition,
continued PPD might be related to the low postpartum ferritin levels in untreated mothers. Based on these results,
iron stores should be evaluated in all mothers with PPD
regardless of anemia and hematologic indices, and when
detecting iron deficiency without anemia, daily iron supplementation should be considered for the early improvement
in PPD and iron stores. However, it is important to note
that these results need to be confirmed by further studies,
as both PPD prevalence and ferritin levels are affected by
socioeconomic, nutritional, and cultural characteristics present within different societies. Additional studies are also
required to evaluate how inflammation and inflammatory
markers after delivery could affect ferritin levels and PPD
symptoms. Furthermore, prospective studies are required to
evaluate the possible side effects of iron supplementation
in these mothers, as well as to assess the clinical effects of
iron supplementation on infants’ colic, breastfeeding, sleep

"The occurrence of phase transition for NaVO2F2 is oen excited

The expected microstructure and structure can be obtained by
controlling the different modes of phase transitions at different

exploited. Therefore, it is very signicant to determine the phase
transition temperature. In the present study, the shi and peak
intensity of Raman characteristic spectra for the NaVO2F2 crystal
change with temperature were analyzed by observing the in situ
Raman spectra, creating a new observation and analysis method
for the phase transition of the NaVO2F2 crystal. The results indicated that different phase transitions occurred near the temperature points of 93 K, 233 K and 453 K during the heating process,
and it was conrmed that the transition from the P21/c phase to
the P21/m phase took place near the temperature point of 453 K,

" The RPH/FPS allows hospital-based clinicians to expand past numerical scores and facial expressions to assess the level of disruption that pain imposes on patients. The RPH/FPS can be used by auxiliary services such as physical therapy and occupational therapy (PT/OT) to glean information about how pain affects function. The care coordinator will also be able to find helpful information regarding the patient's ability to concentrate due to pain, i.e., ""Is now a good time to discuss POC, or is the patient unable to concentrate due to pain."" Auxiliary services are unable to find any of this information using the NPS or any other unidimensional pain scale.

"A new friction reduction technology, termed “earthworm-like drilling” is proposed in this
paper. A mathematical model based on a “soft-string” model is established to verify the technology’s feasibility and advantages. A comparison of three vibration manners reveals that
multi-point vibration drilling is more effective than single-point vibration drilling under the
same conditions. Compared with multi-point simultaneous vibration, the decrease in the friction reduction effect of earthworm-like drilling due to pressure pulse attenuation can be offset
by increasing the number of shakers. The amplitude and frequency of the pulse pressure and
the installation position of the shakers have a substantial impact on friction reduction and the
load transfer effect. Frequency also affects the attenuation and propagation distance of the
pulse pressure aroused by the hydraulic vibrators. In addition, an optimization model based
on the projection gradient method is established and used to optimize the position of three
shakers of a horizontal well. WOB increases significantly after the position optimization. The
new positions of the shakers move toward the bottom of well, and the shakers are close to one
another. Based on the discussion of the feasibility, advantages and influence factors of earthworm-like drilling presented in this paper, earthworm-like drilling is a technology with broad
application prospects.",0

"The present study demonstrates broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of Aspergillus clavatonanicus strain MJ31, against both plant and human pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of
strain MJ31 was established by detection and production of known antibiotics and antimicrobial volatile compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for detection and
quantification of known antibiotics like ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, miconazole, ketokonazole and fluconazole from a single strain of endophytic fungi. We
reported significantly high amount of miconazole in the crude ethyl acetate extract which
again supports its ability to synthesize antimicrobial bioactive compounds. Moreover, detection of betaketosynthase (KS) domain in PKS gene cluster and adenylation domain (A) in
NRPS gene clusters suggests that this strain can serve as a resource for bioactive natural products. We conclude that, the endophytic fungus A. clavatonanicus strain MJ31 associated with
root tissues of M. jalapa showed the ability to resist fungal pathogens which can be exploited
not only in developing biocontrol agents in crop disease management, but also as sustainable
and alternative resource for the discovery of potent antimicrobial metabolites.",0
"and optimization of the emergency logistics network is constructed. In each decision-making cycle, there are four decisionmaking steps which are cyclical and progressive. The four steps include the analysis of public health emergency transmission, design of emergency logistics network, data collection and processing, and the adjustment and update of parameter. In
this decision-making framework, the entire emergency response process of public health emergencies is transformed into
a collaborative decision-making process of data learning and the optimization of resource allocation. The main theoretical
contributions of this paper include the following four aspects: (1) From the perspective of data-driven, we built a real-time

The problem of capacity combination optimization is embedded in the proposed network model of emergency location, so it
is much difficult to solve the general coverage problem within the sets, which has great practical significance; (4) Taking into
account the characteristics of the linear equation system and the principle of trend prediction, the relevant parameters of
health events are dynamically adjusted and updated.
In this paper, we assumed that the population of the infected area remained generally balanced during the transmission of public health emergencies, regardless of population movements in the inflected area. For the study of the
transmission of public health emergencies in the future, we will further consider the impact of the characteristics of
population mobility as well as various government control measures on the transmission dynamics of public health
emergencies. As for the design of emergency logistics networks, we will further consider the impact brought by
emergency budget restrictions, emergency service as well as other factors in the future. The emergency logistics network
model under various scenarios will be compared with the existing emergency modeling methods.",0
"Here we presented an integrative study where comparative analysis and computational prediction have been applied to assess the cross-species transportation of miRNAs, particularly focusing on inferring the likelihood of exogenous miRNA in human circulation. Given the limited
understanding about miRNA circulation, this study will contribute substantially in overcoming
the aforementioned scientific limitations and dramatically reducing the extensive lab-load in
miRNA biology research by using a revolutionary systems-driven strategy to study this complex problem. Specifically, this bioinformatics-driven study enables bypass the following key
issues: (1) Lack of supporting information to discern between endogenous miRNA synthesis or
dietary miRNA absorption in the miRNA expression change in human blood test subjects; (2)
Inference from endogenous miRNA synthesis [67] that might compensate for dietary miRNA
deficiency; (3) potential distinct metabolism of dietary miRNAs in the intestinal mucosa. Substantial follow-up studies will be conducted to extend the analysis and clarify in greater detail

tools developed for characterizing miRNA circulation and targeting will be useful for other

Hence, adjunctive Pulse D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19.",0
"To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine a comprehensive theoretical model of weight bias in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms in bariatric surgery candidates. Our study advances
the understanding of the risk and protective mechanisms associated with

role for weight bias and shame in psychological health among people
with obesity seeking bariatric surgery and implicate self-compassion,
a trainable affect-regulation strategy, as an important protective factor
that may confer some resiliency against EWB-related risk of depression
or anxiety. Continued investigation of the contributions of weight bias,
shame, and self-compassion to psychiatric health in bariatric surgery
patients may contribute to improved screening, detection, and treatment
of those vulnerable to adverse postoperative psychiatric sequelae. Such
efforts will be complemented by ongoing efforts to reduce social stigma

"The present study performed on nearly three hundred university students showed that CMV infection is associated with seemingly increased intelligence measured with The Intelligence Structure Test I-S-T 2000 R. The negative correlation between intelligence and duration of the infection estimated on the basis of concentration of anti-CMV antibodies and the results of the permutation test suggests that the seemingly increased intelligence of CMV-infected subjects is a result of presence of the subpopulation of subjects with very old infection and therefore also the most decreased intelligence in the subpopulation of seronegative subjects. In accordance with the Bradford-Hill 5th criterion of causality, this negative correlation between intelligence and concentration of anti-CMV antibodies also suggests, but, of course, not definitively proves, that the CMV-intelligence association is rather the effect than the cause of the CMV infection. CMV infection in both developing and developed countries is very high; most of the world population is probably infected with this herpetic virus. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human intelligence, and secondarily on all the other aspects of human life, including quality of life and economy, may be extremely high.

"Reference absorbed dose rate measurements of a prototype 106Ru/106Rh eye plaque developed indigenously were carried out using
an extrapolation chamber. Both planar and curved eye plaque were used
for the study to investigate the effect of air gap and positioning un

measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved
106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28
mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate
of curved eye plaque is about ~ 5% as compared to planar eye plaque
which is attributed to differences in the source configuration. The
FLUKA-based dose rates per μCi of 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08
mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06 mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye
plaques which match well with the measurements. It is demonstrated
that an estimate of activity can be derived by comparing the Monte

one has to know the exact geometry of the curved eye plaque and
extrapolation chamber for reliable simulation results and hence the

"RPMD with non-equilibrium initial conditions in combination with
FSSH. RPSH performs well for all one-dimensional scenarios discussed. For cases where the crossing point is below the initial excitation, RPSH performs as well as FSSH, which can capture most of
the exact quantum dynamics. For dynamics involving an energetically higher-lying crossing point, RPSH clearly outperforms standard FSSH with and without Wigner sampling. RPSH can reproduce the time-dependent dissociation probability well and also gives
reasonable adiabatic and diabatic populations. Although only onedimensional scenarios are discussed in this work, the generalization of the approach to any number of degrees of freedom is
straightforward. Both RPMD and FSSH have been employed to treat
high-dimensional systems efficiently, and any equations presented

In order to study the thermoresponsive microspheres-assisted

dilution method, especially around LCST of P(NIPAM-coBMA) brushes. The optimal structural features of PSP(NIPAM-co-BMA) microspheres are medium particle sizes,
large pore sizes, and high brush grafting amounts. Another
important advantage of the particles is the self-precipitation
ability after refolding, which can promote the recovery of the
microspheres through facile filtration",0

"To our knowledge, the present experiments are the first to demonstrate a

task. We replicated Walker and Hulme’s (1999, see also Tse & Altarriba, 2005) item
concreteness effect and further specified that this effect occurred for positive words
but not for negative words. These results indicate that word valence can modulate
immediate serial recall performance above and beyond the influence of word
concreteness. Hulme et al.’s (1997) item redintegration account might explain the
current findings by assuming that an attentional avoidance mechanism is in operation
when participants try to retrieve negative words. Whether the interactive effect
between word valence and word concreteness could also occur in other memory
paradigms, such as working memory tasks and sequential learning paradigms, such as
serial reaction time tasks, should be further investigated in future studies. Future

"In conclusion, a total of 62 volatile compounds (table 1) were identified in all the six flavoured tobacco IQOS HeatSticks, complementing the offline studies submitted by PMI and others. The difference in the identified species arises from the contrasting analytical methodologies, with ours being designed to target volatiles in real time. However, the GC-MS set-up displayed low sensitivities to some compounds and was not able to resolve all isomers. Moreover, compounds beyond a mass of 350 Da could not be analysed due to the imposed limit. Future real-time studies will employ highly sensitive instruments like Orbitrap MS and expand the mass scan range. With this approach, we expect to identify more compounds that may exhibit high toxicity for human health and thereby help improve the tobacco regulatory system. Future work will also focus on quantitative studies on nicotine, humectants (glycerol and propylene glycol) and potential carcinogenic species (carbonyls, furans and phthalates) identified in the GC-MS chromatogram. Quantitative measurements of these studies are relevant for determining the toxicity of the IQOS tobacco sticks.

"We could detect no widespread negative health effects in the unvaccinated other than the rare but
significant vaccine-targeted diagnosis. We can conclude that the unvaccinated children in this practice
are not, overall, less healthy than the vaccinated and that indeed the vaccinated children appear to be
significantly less healthy than the unvaccinated.
We concur with Mawson et al., 2017 [9], who reported: “Further research involving larger,
independent samples is needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in order to
optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health.”
We also concur with Hooker and Miller 2020 [14], who wrote: “Further study is necessary to
understand the full spectrum of health effects associated with childhood vaccination”.
Other pediatric practices with variably vaccinating populations should be studied using a
methodology similar to ours to attempt to refute or validate our findings and those of Mawson et al.,
2017 [9], Hooker and Miller 2020 [14], and the numerous studies that have reported adverse health
following vaccination. We are particularly interested in further study of the relationship between specific
vaccines and combination of vaccines on specific outcomes as well as the relationship between the
uptake of specific types of vaccines—inactivated, live virus, and aluminum-adjuvanted—with specific
outcomes. Larger studies using electronic medical records from major medical institutions should be
undertaken by research teams with no financial interest in the outcome of the studies (e.g., revenue from
vaccination and from treatment of vaccine-related adverse outcomes).
Unintended and nonspecific consequences of vaccination, such as increased risk of chronic health
conditions from vaccine exposures, must also be examined to determine if for any vaccine-targeted
infection alternative methods of infection-avoidance or effective treatments that reduce disease sequela
are available and preferable to vaccination in various circumstances, as has been reported by Cowling

vaccination may increase respiratory virus infection risk, clearly a grave concern in the age of COVID-19.
Our finding of a robust signal of anemia deserves follow up: aluminum is known to bind
to transferrin [26] and, in so doing, may interfere with the proper deposition of iron in the bones
of children. Iron deficiency can also contribute to febrile seizures, a known side effect of some
vaccines. Our society should work to identify safer vaccine schedules and safer adjuvants [27–35] and
to reduce autoimmunity risk by removing unsafe epitopes—peptide sequences from pathogens or
human cell line remnants in vaccines that match human proteins in sequence or structure from any
tissue [36]—would seem expeditious, kind, and wise.

"""Conclusions
        The immunization strategy discussed in this paper is not the only option for outbreak control agencies. In fact, there are three possible general courses of action with regard to ORI. The outbreak can run its course, maximizing the number of infections at the lowest cost. Or, the outbreak control agency can immunize as many persons as possible, thus minimizing the number of infections and maximizing cost. However, there is middle road, the one facilitated by the RPORITA developed in this research: the outbreak control agency can immunize the minimum number of persons required to achieve the ORIT at that point in the outbreak. This approach strikes a balance between these inversely related objectives by limiting both infections and cost, resulting in an optimal strategy for impoverished nations seeking to preserve limited funds.
        It is duly noted that higher vaccination coverage will reduce the number of infections caused by the outbreak, as it would further reduce the individual reproduction number. However, once the individual reproduction number has become less than unity, the outbreak will eventually cease regardless of its exact value within the range from 0 to 1. The specific individual reproduction number determines the number of infections.
        The model for the individual reproduction number in equation (19) can be applied to outbreak control strategy to determine the effects of vaccination on the ability of the VPD to spread through the population at different points in an outbreak. This equation incorporates three critical factors affecting the ability of vaccination to reduce the individual reproduction number: the point in the outbreak at which these vaccinations would occur (involves variables c, S, and I), the vaccination coverage before the new vaccinations (which determines V), and the number of additional vaccinations (). With this tool the time at which vaccination has the optimum impact on the individual reproduction number may be determined. Also, equation (19) may help answer the question: are these vaccinations worth their financial cost at this point in the outbreak?
        Overall, the primary purpose of the RPORITA is to predict, several days in advance, the minimum number of vaccines required to achieve ORIT and thereby gradually stop an outbreak. This prediction capability would allow poorer nations to plan and coordinate an immunization drive that implements the minimum amount of resources needed to guarantee the end to a VPD outbreak at that point. Despite the moderate prediction error, considering the multitude of variables and factors that affect the ORIT during an outbreak, the RPORITA proves to be accurate in its prediction of the ORIT. Overall, the RPORITA strikes a delicate balance between real-time applicability (through simplicity) and accuracy, thus achieving the overall goal of this research.""",0

"Conclusions
      The present study suggested that long-period exposure to TiO2 NPs resulted in severe kidney pathological changes and apoptosis, coupled with unbalance of mineral elements and severe oxidative stress. Furthermore, the nephrotoxicity following exposure to TiO2 NPs may be closely related to significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in immune/inflammatory responses, apoptosis, biological processes, oxidative stress, metabolic processes, the cell cycle, ion transport, signal transduction, cell component, transcription, translation, and cell differentiation. Axud1, Bcl6, Cf1, Cfd, Cyp4a12a, Cyp4a12b, Cyp2d9, Birc5, Crap2, and Tfrc genes may be potential biomarkers of kidney toxicity caused by TiO2 NPs exposure. Therefore, the application of TiO2 NPs in food, toothpastes, cosmetics and medicine should be carried out cautiously.",0
"Conclusions
      This study showed that brain activation decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning, when a patient with schizophrenia was changed from FGA to a SGA medication. Total motor activity, however, was not altered during this change in medication, although our findings interestingly indicate that a change to SGA alters variability measures towards what was seen in a healthy control group shown in one of our prior studies
[11].
      We do not have test-retest data for fMRI from this particular study. This may represent a limitation of the study, since intra- and inter-individual variability generally is a problem in fMRI studies. However we do not think that our findings are caused by such confounding effects, since other studies, using variants of the same paradigm have shown similar patterns as found after medication in the present study
[9,12]. An additional limitation of the fMRI data is the possibility that some of the changes from the first to the second session could be driven by learning effects and by the instruction to press the response button on target trials, which could lead to reduced activation due to facilitation. This is however not likely to explain all the findings that also were outside of areas to be affected. Another limitation is the rather weak statistical effects, not surviving standard correction procedures for multiple significance tests. Such procedures are typically applied to group average data, and may have reduced applicability for a single case study.
      A case study like the current study has its obvious limitations when it comes to generalizations to the population of schizophrenia patients. However, group averages based on large samples could equally be criticised for lacking in representativeness for a single patient, which is what the clinician is facing. Group averages are by definition not fully representative for any individual subject in the group, both because of the effect of statistical averaging and from the perspective of individual variation in response to antipsychotic medication (which is substantial in schizophrenia). Thus, reporting data for a single patient, measured longitudinally, being his own control, may yield clinically relevant data.
      The patterns of variability in the motor activity after switching antipsychotics from a FGA to a SGA are not easy to interpret. While the mean motor activity level and sample entropy were unchanged, risperidone reduced variability, particularly the variability from minute to minute, reflected in the RMSSD and also the RMSSD/SD ratio, towards what has been reported in healthy controls
[11]. Nonlinear methods have addressed the severe disturbances in neurocognitive dysfunctioning as one of the core features of schizophrenia
[13,14]. Wrist worn actigraphy for motor registration and magnetic resonance imaging for brain activation have shown correlations between motor activity and changes in brain structure
[15]. Our findings comparing a patient switching from a first to a second generation antipsychotic supports these findings.
      The high perphenazine level observed in our patient could be explained by the low CYP2D6 metabolic capacity
[16].
      The decreased activation in the right inferior frontal and insula region is somewhat of a puzzle since one would have expected increased activation. It has been suggested that the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula areas are involved in complex attentional and working memory processing. Possibly, these brain areas are involved in cognitive control related to attentional focus on stimuli that are urgent or close in time and space
[17], and it is unclear how such functions relate to reduced activation. Moreover, the right fronto-insular cortex has been implicated in a wide range of cognitive control mechanisms involved in a variety of cognitive control processes, including conflict and error monitoring, interference resolution, and response selection
[18]. The inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula has also been associated with psychosis. Insular dysfunction may be important for the development of psychosis due to its influence on the salience network
[19]. Furthermore, the right inferior frontal area and posterior insula has been indicated in auditory hallucinations
[20].
      We conclude that changes in neuronal brain activation decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning when a patient with schizophrenia was changed from a FGA to a SGA. At the same time although the total motor activity was not altered, variability measures changed towards values seen in healthy controls. Our study underscores the value of casuistic reports of schizophrenic patients examined during different conditions using objective recording methods in pharmacological treatment studies. Although the actigraph data were partly in accordance with the hypothesis, the brain activation results were unexpected, and not hypothesized and would need careful replication in a group study with proper statistical power, before any firm conclusions can be reached.",0

"A facile design of an ultra-thin broadband MA for C-band applications is proposed using a numerical method. The proposed MA is composed of a single layer metal-dielectric-metal structure based on FR-4 substrate. The broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with the absorption efficiency greater than 90% and RAB of 66.67% at normal incidence is achieved. The high absorptivity of proposed MA is also retained over 80% for the large incident angle up to 40° under both TE and TM polarizations. The absorption mechanism of broadband metamaterial absorber is investigated by using electric and surface current distributions, which is also confirmed via the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for the C-band applications such as radar cross section and EM interference reduction.",0

      In summary, PPI was observed for the first time on nano oxide electronic transistors. Representative artificial synaptic behaviors, such as synaptic transmission, PPF and PPI were processed and mimicked here.

When an electrical stimulus was applied, the artificial bio synapse had a temporary increase and then spontaneous decay of conductance along time. The increase in conductance could be amplified or reduced by applying successive stimuli at short intervals. Repeated stimuli made the transition have a residual current for the next round of CC, or could have electrons injected to decrease the next round of CC due to the large amplitude and Vo impact on the device insulator. This research could, thus, help improve neuromorphic electronics for neurocomputing based on biocompatible artificial synapses as well as the development of medical research.",0

"4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported a facile synthesis of nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx via
6 h, 12 h and 20 h hydrothermal treatments of C6H12N4 solution. TiO2/TiN nanoparticles inserted
between the Ti3C2Tx layers, which effectively prevent the self-restacking of Ti3C2Tx during fabrication
and enable more pesudocapacitances. Moreover, benefiting from the introduction of nitrogen and
the NH4
+ intercalation, the accessibility of the Ti3C2Tx layers to electrolyte ions is also enhanced.
When employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the 20 h N-TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx electrode
exhibited high performances with a specific capacitance of 361 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a capacitance
retention of 85.8% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles when used in a three-electrode configuration
in 1 M H2SO4. Besides, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivered an energy density of
4.42 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.14 kW kg−1
. Furthermore, the influence of ionic radius in
different electrolytes were studied by using H2SO4, Li2SO4, Na2SO4, LiOH and KOH electrolytes.
The H2SO4 electrolyte possessed excellent conductivity and empowered faster and easier surface redox
reactions, which brought about greater contributions to intercalation-pseudocapacitance. The excellent
electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique architecture with physical confinement
preventing the restacking of Ti3C2Tx, and the minimized pass path between electrolyte and electrodes.
This facile synthesis paves a new strategy to achieve promising pseudocapacitance MXene electrode
materials in practical applications",0

"5. Conclusion
We found that enemy-mediated conspecific distance- and density-dependence is more likely to happen at the seedling stage
than at the seed stage. There is strong evidence that fungal
pathogens are key drivers in causing conspecific distanceand density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, but
there have been too few studies so far to rule out a role for
specialist insects. Different sizes of mammals had opposite
effects on distance-dependent mortality at the seed stage;
small mammals could cause significant negative distancedependence, but large mammals may overwhelm this effect.
More manipulative experiments considering multiple natural
enemy types combined and separately should be conducted
in the future to reveal the mechanisms behind negative
conspecific density-dependence and make predictions for

"Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice.
Evidence for the benefits and harms of radioembolisation with or without sorafenib and compared with sorafenib alone in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is highly insufficient. We cannot determine if radioembolisation plus sorafenib compared with sorafenib alone affects all‐cause mortality or the occurrence of adverse events. Radioembolisation compared with sorafenib seemed to achieve equivalent survival and to cause fewer adverse effects, but our level of certainty was very low. Evidence for the benefits and harms of radioembolisation versus chemoembolisation in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is also highly insufficient. Radioembolisation did not seem to differ from chemoembolisation in terms of serious adverse events and health‐related quality of life, but the certainty of evidence was very low. Additional well‐performed and high‐quality placebo‐controlled randomised clinical trials are needed to assess patient‐centred outcomes.",0

"Conclusions
In this study, an injectable and thermosensitive hydrogel encapsulating Cu2MnS2 nanoparticles for photothermal therapy against cancer was reported. The Cu2MnS2 particles show nanoplate structure with a diameter of about 35 nm. The nanoplates evenly distributed in the hydrogel matrix and, maintained its particle size unchanged. The PTA loaded hydrogel shows excellent photo-heat conversion ability and outstanding repeated irradiation stability. The hydrogel not only exhibited thermo-responsive in situ gel-forming capacity at body temperature, but also reduced the chemical toxicity of the Cu2MnS2 by “prisoning” the nanoplates in the matrix. Moreover, the concentrated PTA in the hydrogel performed more promising therapeutic effects against cancer cells than the nanoplates solution. At last, the Cu2MnS2 nanoplates embedded hydrogel displayed pronouncing tumor curing effects after peritumoral administration due to the enhanced retention in vivo and elevated local temperature surrounding the tumor tissue upon the NIR exposure. Meantime, the preparation shows insignificant systemic toxicity.",0
"Conclusion
A facile design of an ultra-thin broadband MA for C-band applications is proposed using a numerical method. The proposed MA is composed of a single layer metal-dielectric-metal structure based on FR-4 substrate. The broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with the absorption efficiency greater than 90% and RAB of 66.67% at normal incidence is achieved. The high absorptivity of proposed MA is also retained over 80% for the large incident angle up to 40° under both TE and TM polarizations. The absorption mechanism of broadband metamaterial absorber is investigated by using electric and surface current distributions, which is also confirmed via the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for the C-band applications such as radar cross section and EM interference reduction.",0

of the fermented bases. However, it was shown that it was different in all three bases.
This reflects an important role of the base on the texture. Supplementation with LGG®

Abstract
The present investigation aimed to assess the impact of copper (Cu) stress on the physiological and proteomic behavior of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. E. camaldulensis is likely a potential phytoremediator in areas vulnerable to Cu contamination, such as the industrial areas of Riyadh. To realize this objective, young seedlings of E. camaldulensis were potted in an open area with soil comprised of clay and sand. Different doses of Cu (30, 50, and 100 µM) were applied to the plants as CuSO4·5H2O for 6 weeks. Plant growth was monitored during the Cu exposure period, and morphological and physiological indicators were measured once a week to determine the growth rates. A proteomics study was also conducted to find out the influence of Cu stress on proteins. Our results showed that growth was negatively affected by Cu treatment, particularly at the highest concentrations. Moreover, using a proteomic analysis showed 26 targets involved in protein expression. Elevated levels of Cu increased the expression of 11 proteins and decreased the expression of 15 proteins. Changes were detected in proteins involved in photosynthesis, translation, transcription, metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings provided insights into the molecular mechanisms related to Cu stress, in addition to its influence on the morphological and physiological attributes of E. camaldulensis seedlings. This investigation aimed to characterize the mechanism behind the impact of Cu stress on the plant.

1. Introduction
Today the globe is facing critical environmental crises, posing severe problems to humans and natural habitats [1]. Among such ecological complications is the stress in plants caused by water and soil contaminated with heavy metals, leading to stress in the overall food chain. Recently, a variety of factors have substantiated the pollution levels of air, water, and soil. Such factors include industrial activities, abandonment, sewage discarding practices, and the growth of cities, all posing toxic threats to living organisms [2,3]. Heavy metals are broadly recognized by their relatively high atomic masses (usually above 4 g/cm3), and are poisonous even at low concentrations [4,5]. For adequate plant development, some heavy metals are considered essential nutrients that play significant roles in plant life. However, accumulation of such metals in the environment has increased dramatically, often higher than that necessary for the plant’s growth. Under these elevated levels, all heavy metals have increased toxic effects and can be regarded as ecological impurities [6].
Many reports indicate plants are equipped with specialized tolerance mechanisms that mitigate the adverse effects of heavy metal exposure, although significant damage in plants, such as suppression of photosynthesis, was also observed as a consequence of elevated heavy metal exposure [7,8]. However, Maisto et al. [9] reported contrasting observations related to photosynthesis in Quercus ilex L. leaves when studying metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as indicators of pollution.
The toxicity of heavy metals involves its binding to functional sites in biologically vital molecules (enzymes), disturbing cell integrity by changing proteins and nucleic acids, as well as disrupting other important metabolites in the cell [10]. Among the heavy metals, copper (Cu2+) is a toxic metal. In the current investigation we focus on Cu2+. Cu2+ is a redox-active transition ion and a necessary micro-element for plant development [11], however, it can be considered a toxic element when its concentrations in plant tissue exceeds that of the optimum requirement [12,13,14]. The positive influence of Cu on plant growth has long been observed, and has been well-recognized when fungicides containing Cu salts are used [15]. However, the common and continued use of fungicides in cultivated areas has led to a high accumulation of Cu, putting both the ecological value and the fertility of the soil at hazardous levels [16]. Plants exposed to heavy metals may also be subjected to a widespread range of physiological and biochemical alterations [17].
Auto-oxidation and the Fenton reaction usually lead to development of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the block of important biomolecules. Movement of metal ions from such biomolecules is the main mechanism of heavy metal accumulation in plant tissues [2]. Furthermore, in our post-genomic era, proteomics is a well-known technique to study protein expression in an organism through its genome [18,19]. Moreover, plant stress responses, and adaptation to the stress caused by heavy metals, are frequently associated with alterations in the proteome [17]. Proteomics can be used as a powerful technique to uncover differences in cell, tissue, organ, and organelle protein levels, including the profiles under several heavy metal stress environments [20]. The literature also mentions that proteomics help in detecting the target proteins involved in heavy metal detoxification. Recent studies confirmed the increments of defense protein involved in ROS scavenging and in maintaining redox homeostasis in heavy metal stressed plants [21,22]. In an early study by Bona et al. [23], the response of Cannabis sativa roots to Cu stress was reported. Their findings revealed variations in the protein expression pattern for reinstating cellular homeostasis, where two proteins were suppressed, seven proteins were down regulated, and five proteins were up regulated. Some proteomic studies were focused on Cu stress in Arabidopsis thaliana [24], Cannabis sativa roots L. [23], Oryza sativa [25], and Agrostis capillaris [26].
Plants react differentially to heavy metal stresses according to their species, the metal type, and metal concentration [27]. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of plant responses are needed using proteomic studies under Cu stress. In the current study we have tried to uncover the relationship between Cu stress and the molecular response in E. camaldulensis seedlings. E. camaldulensis has been used in the current study because it is abundant in Riyadh industrial areas. These industries might be the main reason for environmental contamination, especially in industries where production of fertilizer involves Cu and leads to its bioavailability and abundance in the environment. Furthermore, E. camaldulensis is characterized by its fast growth rate, relatively large biomass, extensive root system, and its tolerance to a wide spectrum of soil conditions [28]. Therefore, the present investigation was based on the assumption that E. camaldulensis would fit as a good candidate plant species for environmental clean-up in sites contaminated with heavy metals. This hypothesis might be well supported by Assareh et al. [29]. Nevertheless, its molecular response to Cu stress is still vague. Proteomics results and physiological responses from the current study might improve our understanding of E. camaldulensis and its response to Cu stress. A thorough understanding of the plant’s stress response to heavy metals could support the identification of tolerance proteins or genes, and the development of a detoxification tool [30].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethics Statement
Determination of the target species chosen for this study was performed by collecting materials of several plant species from three different locations (Riyadh industrial area, landfill near Nazeem, and Thumamah) in Riyadh (N 38.24°, E 43.46°), Saudi Arabia. No collection specifications were obligatory for these locations. Plants used in the current study are public and non-protected types. The candidate plant species chosen for the current investigation is E. Camaldulensis due to its availability in the three different locations.
2.2. Material Collection and Treatment
E. camaldulensis seedlings (three months old) were provided from a commercial nursery in Riyadh, May 2017. Similar genetic backgrounds were expected since plants were collected from the same source. The seedlings were acclimated to a greenhouse (temperature 28–35 °C, photoperiod 12 hours per day). E. camaldulensis seedlings were placed into pots (16 cm diameter) containing a soil mixture of clay:sand in a 1:2 ratio. The experimental plants were exposed to a wide range of Cu concentrations (100, 50, and 30 µM of Cu, applied as CuSO4·5H2O for a period of six weeks). Each Cu treatment was comprised of four replicates. Shoots and roots per plant were cut, washed in deionized water, placed in airtight plastic bags, and then kept at −80 °C for additional study.
2.3. Growth and Physiological Performance
During the experimental period, growth indicators were monitored weekly (height, stem collar width, and leaf formation), and the relative growth rates were calculated. The relative water content of the leaves, and fresh weights of both shoot and root were determined gravimetrically following termination of the experiment. Plant samples were oven-dried for one week at 60 °C to achieve a constant weight for determining shoot and root dry mass.
2.4. Determination of Relative Water Content
For determination of relative water content in the plant under Cu stress, leaf tissues were taken to determine the relative water content, according to Morgan [31], with the aid of the following equation:
RWC(%)=(fresh weight − dry weight)(sturated weight − dry weight)×100
2.5. Determination of Chlorophyll Content
Leaf samples were collected and frozen immediately. Chlorophyll content was determined when 5 mL of 80% acetone was added to a 0.5 g leaf sample and measured using spectrophotometer. Resulting data were calculated as mg/g Fresh weight [32]. Chlorophyll content data was presented as mean ± SD for three replicates.
2.6. Determination of Copper (Cu) Concentration
Cu concentrations in leaves and root tissues were determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (NOVA 300, Analytik, Jena, Germany) according to Fu et al. [33]. Dry plant samples were milled to a fine powder, then digested using perchloric acid and nitric acid in a ratio of 13:87 by volume. Thereafter, 5% of HNO3 was used to dissolve the digest for Cu quantification.
2.7. Protein Extraction from Plant Leaves
For the determination of protein, liquid nitrogen was used for milling the frozen leaves using a mortar and pestle. The protein extraction procedure was done according to Roy et al. [34]. To perform two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), a trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone protocol was used. Two technical replicates per sample were prepared.
2.8. Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA)/Acetone Protocol
Leaf powders from the control plants (3 g) and the Cu-treated plants (100 µM) were placed in 10 mL of ice-cold 10% TCA in 0.07% (v/v) acetone and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The homogenate was sonicated for 10 min and incubated for 1 h at −20 °C. The pellet was separated after centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min, washed with ice-cold acetone (0.07% (v/v) 2-ME) twice, and then centrifuged at 4 °C and dehydrated. Thereafter, dried samples were lysed using buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 5% CHAPS, and 2 mM tributylphosphine), incubated for 60 min at 25 °C, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min. Thereafter, protein concentration was determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) method [35].
2.9. Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2-DE) Protein Gel Electrophoresis
A gel electrophoresis technique (two-dimensional isoelectric focusing) was performed utilizing a Bio-Rad PROTEAN IEF (isoelectric focusing) cell on an IPG strip with a length of 24 cm and pH 5–8 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). For protein dilution, 300 lg total protein was diluted with a rehydration solution (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 1% DTT, 0.2% IPG buffer (pH 5–8), and 0.001% bromophenol blue) to 420 ll. Active rehydration was done by loading the samples into the IEF tray at 20 °C for 13 h, followed by 250 V for 60 min. Subsequently, a linear increase of voltage was applied to 10,000 V for a period of four hours, with isoelectric focusing operated at 20 °C for 90,000 VH. Following IEF separation, strips were equilibrated for 15 min in an equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 0.375 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 2% DTT), then re-equilibrated for 15 min using the same buffer, except that DTT was replaced by 2.5% iodoacetamide. The 2-D SDS electrophoresis was done on 12.5% (w/v) horizontal slab gels using a Bio-Rad PROTEAN PLUS horizontal Dodeca cell at a temperature of 18 °C. For application of SDS–PAGE, voltage was fixed at 100 V for 60 min, then increased to 200 V until the bromophenol blue frontier was detected at the gel bottom.
2.10. Protein Imaging
For the purpose of staining protein spots, an image scanner (HP Scanjet G 4010) was used and the analysis was performed using the Progenesis Same Spot software version 3.0 (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd.). Two replicates from both control and Cu-treated gels were used to carry out the match set with the selected master gels. Student’s t-test (p ≤ 0.05) was used to find out differences in the abundance between spots. For MS (mass spectrometry) identification, protein spots with > 2-fold changes were used.
2.11. Bioinformatics Analysis of the Identified Proteins
Proteins identified in the current investigation were clustered according to Colak et al. [36] using DAVID gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis bioinformatics tools. Fold changes of identified proteins at Cu treatment (100 µM) compared to control are presented.
2.12. Statistical Analysis
The current data was statistically processed using JMP statistical program (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Trials were set using four plants per Cu treatment. A one-way ANOVA was used, and means were separated by a Tukey-test at p ≤ 0.05 significance, which is denoted by dissimilar letters. Figures were prepared using Origin software.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Changes in Plant Morphology
With progressive increases of Cu treatment, leaf chlorosis was noticeable after five weeks from the commencement of Cu treatment in the E. camaldulensis seedlings. The degree of chlorosis was more intense in plants that received 100 µM compared to those treated with low Cu concentrations (30 and 50 µM). In addition, the leaves on the plant that received the highest Cu dose started to droop and saw increasing discoloration. Early studies indicated that phytotoxicity induced by excessive Cu uptake may lead to plant growth suppression, membrane lipid peroxidation, leaf chlorosis, and necrosis [24,37]. Some of these results and observations are in agreement with our current findings.
3.2. Influence of Cu on Plant Growth
Exposure of E. camaldulensis to Cu caused no effect on shoot height both at 30 and 50 µM concentrations; however, seedlings that received the highest dose (100 µM) exhibited significant reductions in their shoot height growth rates compared to untreated controls (Figure 1a). A similar response pattern was also observed in both stem diameter (Figure 1b) and leaf formation (Figure 1c). Furthermore, data showed higher Cu concentrations in roots relative to that in the shoots (Figure 1d).

Figure 1. Effects of Cu stress on (A) shoot height, (B) stem diameter, (C) leaf formation, and (D) Cu concentration in the leaves and roots of E. camaldulensis seedlings. Different letters indicate significant differences at p < 0.05. Each experiment was performed in four replicates.
The observed reduction in plant growth might be attributed to the inhibitory impact of the metal on the metabolic processes responsible for growth and development, which is in agreement with many other previous studies [9,14,38]. Furthermore, quantitative analysis showed that relative water content, chlorophyll content, shoot and root fresh weight, and shoot and root dry weight of seedlings treated with the highest dose (100 µM) were significantly reduced by 33.3%, 54.8%, 36.5%, 42.5%, 40.7%, and 33.3% respectively, relative to those of the control (Table 1). On the other hand, similar trends in observations and reductions were noticed for shoot and root fresh weight and shoot and root dry weight for O. glazioviana in response to Cu stress [27]. The perturbation in the biomass production in both shoot and root might be linked to the effect of Cu on cell division, which retarded normal cell growth and development [39]. The diminishing effect of Cu on chlorophyll content and remarkable reduction in relative leaf water content might be a consequence of Cu stress, as reported in other studies [40,41,42]. Mostofa et al. [41] stated that Cu stress induced a reduction in rice seedling growth, which might be due to the disruptive interference Cu has in protein and plant metabolism. Addition of Cu to E. camaldulensis seedlings was found to increase the Cu level in the plant tissues, with the root retaining more Cu relative to the shoot (Figure 1d), which indicates that roots are the main site for the accumulation of Cu. This observation conformed with several former reports in rice and beans [41,43].
Table 1. Effect of copper (Cu) stress on growth characteristics of E. camaldulensis. Statistically significant differences are indicated with stars: (*) p < 0.05 or (**) p < 0.01. Data are given as means ± standard deviation (SD).

Different studies have indicated that Cu is a detrimental metal that interferes with a plant’s morphological, physiological, and proteomic characteristics because Cu is highly toxic to the plant [44,45,46]. Fold changes in protein and protein expression in relation to Cu stress are introduced in Table 2. Twenty six (26) proteins were identified under Cu stress from the leaves of E. camaldulensis—11 saw increased protein expression and 15 saw decreased protein expression.

The 26 differentially expressed proteins were identified and the UniProt database was used. Figure 2 illustrates the protein gel images, and Figure 3 shows the abundance patterns of different separated proteins. Figure 4 shows the functional classes of the identified proteins with respect to their biological functions (Figure 4a,b) and cellular constituents (Figure 4c).

3.4. Changes in Proteomic Profile
The current investigation was designed to explore the possible mechanisms for the alterations seen in the plant protein when affected by Cu. The leaf proteome was tested using 2D-GE. Soluble proteins were determined from leaf tissues of both the treated and control plants. The experiment was replicated twice and identified 200 protein spots. Image analyses quantified 26 proteins expressing greater than a 1.5-fold increase in concentration. Out of the 26 differentially expressed proteins, 11 proteins increased expression, whereas the remaining 15 proteins assumed a decrease in the treated sample relative to controls. Figure 3 represents the separated proteins as a comparison between control and treated plants.
The separated proteins for the plants pre-treated with Cu were categorized in different groups according to molecular functions, including metabolic processes (45.8%), photosynthesis (16.7%), anti-oxidant enzymes (8.3%), transcription and translation processes (25%), and other unknown functions (15.5%). Cu stress may affect protein metabolism, which leads to a reduction in the protein concentration [47]. Different biological functions for such separated proteins might point to the complex plant processes observed under Cu stress conditions.
3.4.1. Photosynthetic Proteins
It is well known that photosynthesis is the most important biological process in plants, and this process is extremely sensitive to various stress conditions. A high accumulation of heavy metals inhibits the plant’s growth and development, in addition to its effect on the photosynthetic products [39]. Previous investigations have shown that elevated levels of Cu stress adversely influence the physiological and biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, metabolism of nitrogen, and element uptake in plants [13,48]. In the current study, several photosynthesis-related proteins were significantly reduced in Cu-stressed plants, such as rubisco (large and small sub-units). Photosynthesis-related proteins were also decreased by Cd stress in Brassica juncea [49,50], and had a damaging effect on vital activities, including photosynthesis, in Zea mays [51]. However, a recent investigation provided sufficient evidence, where photosynthetic responses to Cd and Pb stress in cardoon plant varieties were studied, to indicate that the effect of heavy metals on plants is species-specific [52].
Our findings also revealed that photosystem II was down-regulated. Similar response patterns have also been reported for other metals, such as Cd stress in sorghum [34]. The light-dependent photosynthesis reaction cytochrome b6 was negatively impacted by Cu stress. Similar observations were also noted by Hego et al. [26] when they studied the leaves of Cu-sensitive and Cu-tolerant Agrostis cappilaris. Alterations in photosynthetic electron transport chain components in response to stress may occur in the proteins involved cytochrome b6f [53]. Therefore, light-dependent (cytochrome b) and independent (rubisco) photosynthetic reactions were decreased, or negatively affected, by excess Cu in the leaves of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. This indicates damage in the photosynthesis mechanism since rubisco is the key enzyme responsible for CO2 assimilation during the dark reaction phase.
3.4.2. Antioxidant Enzymes and Related Proteins
Plant exposure to Cu may generate ROS, leading to oxidative stress and cell mortality [54]. Plants may develop defense mechanisms to mitigate and alleviate such effects, and prevent cell oxidation [55]. These mechanisms might be associated with enzymatic compounds, such as peroxidases and superoxide dismutase, that play an important ROS scavenging role. Some studies have shown that metal stress (such as Cd) may impair the antioxidant system in plants; therefore, ROS will be induced and will directly react with cellular components and organelles [56]. The anticipated accumulation of ROS during Cu stress may lead to the generation of high levels of antioxidant enzymes. Our study revealed that enzymes related to peroxidase detoxification were down regulated, however the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase showed increased accumulation during Cu treatment. A comparable pattern for SOD activity was also noted by Li et al. [46] when they studied Eichhornia crassipes and Pistatia stratiotes under Cd stress. Peroxidase down-regulation, observed for the Cu-stressed plants in the current study, might lead to speculation that the peroxidase was consumed during the defense process. Although, in a recent study [27], peroxidase accumulation in the roots of Oenthera glazioviana under Cu stress was shown.
In conclusion, alteration in the expression of ROS detoxification-related enzymes was apparent in the current study for peroxidase and Cu/Zn-SOD, highlighting the functions they display in cell protection.
3.4.3. Glycolysis and Carbohydrate Metabolism Related Proteins
The current investigation identified six proteins: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, Sucrose synthase, Phosphoribulokinase, Starch synthase_ chloroplastic/amyloplastic, and Phospholipase D. Glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GADPH) dehydrogenase is the major redox controller in metabolic process [57]. In energy metabolism the CA cycle is a key pathway for ATP synthesis, and responds to stressed environments through respiratory oxidation [58]. The current findings showed up-regulation of GADPH in plants exposed to Cu, as it could be involved in the response to biotic stress in the plant by glycolysis [59]. Similar increments of GADPH in A. thaliana under Cd stress was observed [60]. On the other hand, reduction of GADPH was reported when barley and rice were subjected to stress conditions with salt [61], and Poplar root when treated with Cd [62]. Furthermore, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, a catalyst involved in splitting fructose-1-6-bisphosphate into D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [63], is involved in glycolysis in the cytoplasm and in the Calvin cycle. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase decreased in the current study in response to Cu stress, as well as in Ectocarpus siliculosus isolated from Cu-contaminated soil [64]. Down-regulation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in the current study was supported by Kamal et al., [65] when he studied salt stress in wheat. The significance of MDH in Brachypodium seedling roots was reported as an adaptation response to a biotic stress by Chen et al. [66]. The down-regulation of MDH was observed during the first 3 days, but at 4 days it responded to Cd and osmotic stresses. Malte dehydrogenase may enhance a plant’s resistance to salt and Al stress since it increases the malic acid levels [67].
3.4.4. Energy and Carbohydrate Metabolism Proteins
The beta subunit of ATP synthase identified in the current investigation was down-regulated. It is an integrated protein associated with ATP hydrolysis and proton movement, providing electrochemical compounds [68]. Therefore, an increased production of ATP in response to Cu stress was expected. In a recent work, stimulation of ATPases in Agrostis capillaris leaves under Cu stress was noted [26], whereas other studies using tomato and wheat plants showed that ATPases were reduced in response to salt stress [69].
3.4.5. Proteins Involved in Transcription and Translation
Suppression of proteins and enzyme inactivation induced by heavy metal stress may affect cellular homeostasis [50]. Damaging effects on many cellular processes might be a consequence of the limitations in different gene regulators due to heavy metal stress [70]. In the present investigation, translational proteins such as 30S ribosomal S14, 30S ribosomal S15, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were down-regulated in E. camaldulensis leaves under 100 µM Cu treatment; however, elongation factor Tu was up-regulated. The eIF5A protein is a eukaryotic protein that contains hypusine amino acid; it has an important role as the translation initiation factor in RNA metabolism [71], and translation elongation [72]. Increased expression of eIF5A in plants related to abiotic stress was noted [73]. Currently, down regulation of eIF5A was noted (Table 2). Results were in line with Chen et al. [45] when he studied the behavior of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar roots under Cu stress. The main subunit of ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts is 30S [74]. This protein is involved in the translation process. 30S ribosomal protein S14 and S15 in chloroplasts were down-regulated in the current study under 100 µM Cu treatment in E. camaldulensis leaves. The same observations were also detected for Poplar leaves under Cd stress [75]. Genes related to translation and transcription can be expressed and regulated when the plant is subjected to adverse environmental conditions, leading to adaptation [76]. In the higher plants, the translational elongation step is mainly regulated by elongation factors. Down-regulation of the putative elongation factor 2 in rice under Cu stress conditions was noted [45], however, the current study detected up-regulation of elongation factors for E. camaldulensis leaves under Cu stress. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are enzymes that amplify microRNAs in eukaryotes [77], and protect plants against pathogenic agents [78]. In the current study, down regulation of RdRp was observed. Heat stress showed a decrease in mutant rdr2 for the gene encoding RdRp2 and dcl3 in Arabidopsis [79].
4. Conclusions
As stated previously, accumulation of heavy metals in plants may lead to a variety of deleterious effects in growth and development via perturbations in metabolic network. Cu can be highly toxic to plants when taken in excessive amounts. Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to highlight the alterations in plant metabolism that take place in E. camaldulensis as it responds to Cu stress exposure. Several stress indicators, together with proteomic studies, were analyzed under Cu stress to diagnose the effects. The damaging effects of Cu on growth and biomass elements for the E. camaldulensis seedlings was apparent, with the response being most pronounced under the elevated Cu level of 100 µM. Proteomic analysis performed in this investigation identified 26 proteins related to various metabolic functions, and such proteins were expressed at different availability levels under Cu stress conditions. The majority of the characterized proteins were mainly stress proteins as well as metabolism and regulatory proteins. Results obtained from the proteomic analysis has provided significant clues on how E. camaldulensis responds to Cu stress to achieve homeostasis.
Our findings showed a significant influence of Cu on protein metabolism, as attested by the inhibition of protein function. Proteomic analysis revealed the presence of special stress-related proteins, which can be speculated to assist E. camaldulensis seedlings in handling exposure to Cu exposure. In the future, it would be beneficial to further investigate the long-term effects of Cu on E. camaldulensis. Results of long-term investigations would enhance our understanding of the responsiveness of E. camaldulensis under various Cu toxicity levels.",0

Based on 40 studies of ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes, this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed pooled ORs of 1.03–1.21 for LBW and 0.97–1.06 for PTB when mothers were exposed to CO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 throughout their pregnancy. These associations may be relatively stable, but could be affected by some important factors such as exposure period, study settings, and smoking factors, which decreased the heterogeneity to some extent, but remained mostly non-significant in this study. Therefore, sources of heterogeneity between studies need to be further explored in future meta-analyses.",0

"5. Conclusions
In the present paper, we have shown that the ambient-dose-rate reduction function obtained from the airborne monitoring data can be applied uniformly to all zones in Date City. Regardless of the magnitude of the ambient dose rate, the difference in decontamination method, or whether or not decontamination was carried out, the reduction function was the same throughout Date City. Based on these results, the lifetime additional doses can be realistically estimated from the measured individual doses, extrapolated by means of the ambient-dose-rate reduction function. For establishing this method, which combines the individual dose and the ambient dose, the existence of large-scale and long-term glass-badge data of Date City was essential. Although the proportionality coefficient c = 0.15 may not be universal, the authors believe that the present method will make it possible in the future to reliably estimate the lifetime doses of residents living in contaminated areas based on regular airborne monitoring surveys, supplemented by smaller-scale individual dose monitoring surveys for the purpose of determining the ambient-dose-to-individual-dose coefficient c.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis leads to the conclusion that VR is a useful tool to reduce P in children undergoing dental treatment. No significant effect was found for DA. Studies in adults are scarce. On the other hand, most of the studies chose to focus on immersion in the pediatric population, neglecting a series of aspects that should be considered, such as training programs, the different types of software and hardware of virtual reality devices, the temperament and patient personality, gender difference and more. Due to all this, the role of virtual reality in the control of anxiety and dental pain in children and adults should be considered as a topic for future research.",0
"Conclusions
Anhedonia in youth is associated with hypoconnectivity at rest and hypoactivation during reward anticipation. This suggests perturbed intrinsic arousal connectivity and diminished extrinsic reward-arousal activity in the reward-anticipation context. Detecting such anhedonia-specific alterations helps differentiate the pathophysiological underpinnings of anhedonia from other phenotypes.",0
"Conclusion
The ability to rapidly adjust to novel information about a talker is perhaps not surprising a—statistical account in which listeners weighted all tokens from a talker equally would generate the prediction that it would be extremely difficult to adapt to the speech of very well-known talkers if a new perturbation or disruption was introduced. It would mean, for instance, that listeners who had only seen Meryl Streep playing American roles would struggle when confronted with her Polish-accented English in “Sophie’s Choice”, or that one might fail to understand the distorted speech of one’s parent after dental surgery. It is an empirical question whether this is the case for very familiar talkers. However, for the novel talkers in the current experiment, listeners appear to be maximally flexible to the most recent biasing information they are provided with, and do not create particularly rigid talker-specific beliefs.

The results of the current study urge a more detailed specification of memory in current models of distributional learning. Our findings particularly point to the flexibility that listeners show in accumulating phonetic information about a talker. Distributional accounts must allow (a) new evidence to have an outsize effect on learning, or (b) for local distributions to be formed on the basis of contextual information, for instance, allowing for the accumulation of information in units as long as the lexical decision block.",0

Topical application of 4% chlorhexidine on the umbilical cord of newborn infants born in lower income countries reduces neonatal mortality by 21% and omphalitis by 35%. Chlorhexidine use delays cord separation time by about 2.5 days in the hospital setting and 2 days in the community. The intervention is effective in both community-based as well as health facility settings for the prevention of omphalitis.

"Conclusions
Overall, obese patients had a higher incidence of TREM-1 over-expression and M1 macrophage proliferation. TREM-1 overexpression is associated with increased M1 macrophage markers and Th1 cytokines, and inversely related to M2 macrophage and Th2 cytokines. Our data also suggests that TREM-1 overexpression may predispose the pre-diabetics to obesity-induced IR via macrophage polarization. Thus, our study suggests that targeting TREM-1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in preventing the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance.",0
"5. Conclusions
The search for pro-survival factors is relevant for improving
stress resistance and preventing cell death of microbial cells under
industrial processes. Here, the Tps1 protein and its interplay with
apoptotic processes delineates novel targets for the selection and
engineering of more robust industrial strains. Conversely, Almeida
et al. (2008) reported the urgent need for a new generation of antifungal drugs that could enable the specific manipulation of yeast
cell death, without causing side effects on human cells. Despite
the high conservation of cell death processes between yeasts and
mammals, our finding that yeast apoptotic cell death was greatly
accelerated upon deletion of TPS1 could fulfil this need, since the
Tps1 protein is only presentin bacteria, fungi and plants, but absent
in mammals. Together with the key function of the Tps1 protein in
providing tolerance to hostile environments (Petitjean et al., 2015),
this architectural difference between apoptotic regulators of yeast
and mammalian cells appeared as a possible Achilles’ heel of yeast.
Beyond S. cerevisiae, the Tps1 protein could therefore represent
an appealing target for the selective destruction of closely related
pathogens (e.g. Candida albicans) and evolutionarily more distant
fungi (e.g. A. fumigatus).",0
"CONCLUSION
This paper presented novel perspectives for improving the understanding of connections between EMF exposure and IEQ in buildings. We proposed several strategies for mitigating electromagnetic emissions to improve building occupant health. A novel approach was developed based on a systematic method for exposure assessment of various building environments, including green buildings.

Emission intensity levels varied significantly based on locations and types of building spaces. Office building spaces exhibited relatively low electromagnetic emission intensity, and hospital building spaces exhibited relatively high power density values. The high electromagnetic emission intensities measured in surveyed green residential buildings highlight the importance of novel strategies for reducing radiation propagation. EMF intensity is greater at locations near radiation sources. Different types of building construction respond variably to EMF wave propagation. Certain materials, such as drywall, ceramic-faced lumber, tile-faced drywall, and plain or masonry-faced concrete, effectively shield EMF propagation, whereas glass and plain lumber have poor shielding effects. Drywall exhibited the best shielding effect among all compared building materials. Additionally, the magnitudes of the transmission coefficients for magnetic fields were higher than the corresponding power densities for all building wall materials. Infants, children, senior citizens, and patients all have relatively weak immune systems that are susceptible to radiation exposure. Therefore, it is important to design sensitive spaces using drywall and ceramic- or masonry-faced concrete walls.

All measured field exposures were significantly lower than the corresponding ICNIRP safety limits. However, the exposure intensities were significantly higher than the safety levels defined by many countries. Therefore, measuring exposure intensity is extremely important for preventing adverse thermal health effects. Emissions exceeding safety limits require appropriate countermeasures if they occur regularly. The exposure intensities measured in this study exceeded the safety limits defined by Switzerland, raising significant concerns regarding adverse health effects.

Although EMFs cannot be completely avoided, it is possible to achieve significant reduction in their magnitude. Key strategies for improving IEQ include the use of shielding materials, building spatial design, reduction in exposure time, increased distance from radiation sources, and complete avoidance of exposure to electronic devices in sensitive areas. In Qatar, there are no standards limiting EMF exposure at work or home. Although Qatar strives to create healthy environments through building construction, additional efforts are required to mitigate electromagnetic emissions inside buildings. The findings of this study are consistent with the results and implications presented in previous publications.",0

"4. Conclusions
The increase in the skin dose due to the longitudinal magnetic field of the v2 linac-MR
systems depends on the SSD (air gap), the photon beam field size, and the beam energy. Our
previous work showed that the surface dose for a conventional Varian 600C linac was 10–11%
for various SSDs (figure 8 in Keyvanloo et al (2012)). For SSDs between 100 and 120 cm,
increases in the skin dose range between ~6%–19% and ~1%–9% is seen for the 6 and 10 MV v2
systems, respectively. As the side of the square field is increased from 5cm to 20 cm the

increase in the skin dose of the 6 MV v2 system varies from ~10.5% to ~1.5%; for the 10 MV
v2 system the increase is ~6% for a 5 × 5cm2
 field, while a decrease of ~1.5% is observed for
a 20 × 20 cm2
 field. These results suggest that changes to the skin dose are not expected to be
a limitation in the clinical use of the v2 systems. This also validates that the fringe field of the
new magnet and yoke design does not produce clinically unacceptable skin dose. Further, the
relatively lower skin dose increase seen at 10 MV offers a possible advantage in future designs
of linac-MR prototypes.
An important result of this work is that the reduction in dose rate caused by the extended
SSDs of these linac-MR systems can be overcome by reshaping the flattening filter while
minimizing the increase in the skin dose. The proposed reshaped flattening filter increased
the dose rate of the v2 systems from 355 MU min−1
 with a conventional flattening filter, to
529 MU min−1
 (6 MV) or 604 MU min−1
 (10 MV). For both energies, the skin dose was
increased by ~2.6% using this reshaped filter. Treatment times on the v2 linac-MR would then
be comparable to current clinical linacs. Flattening filter redesign thus provides an effective
method of recovering the dose rate lost due to the increased SAD of the v2 system while minimizing the increase in skin dose",0

The achievement of the same clinical effect with a significantly lower (about 1/5) dosage of betahistine can be explained by the inhibition of the MAO-B by selegiline leading to higher serum concentrations of betahistine. This approach is in line with recent developments to bypass the first-pass effect of betahistine by transbuccal or intranasal application. Despite the substantial methodological limitations of such an observational study, this combined pharmacotherapy could be an alternative to a high-dosage monotherapy with betahistine of MD.",0
"Conclusions
This study investigated the effects of gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation on fibromyalgia. We were interested in whether rhythmic sensory stimulation would promote significant changes in fibromyalgia and associated symptoms, and whether treatment effects would differ between two distinct treatment parameters. Our results indicated that there were statistically significant changes from baseline in measures of fibromyalgia symptoms, pain interference, depression, and sleep quality. However, no significant between-group differences were observed. These preliminary findings suggest that gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation may decrease fibromyalgia symptoms and ease associated comorbidities, such as sleep disturbances and depression. Further research is needed to confirm the present results and to better elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying clinical responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation.",0
"6 Conclusion
In this research, we propose an E–M approach to obtain the coefficient estimation and perform regularization simultaneously for AFT model with a general loss function, such as, but not limited to, the Square loss, absolute loss, Huber’s loss, and Tukey’s loss, based on the right-censored survival data. Our proposed algorithms utilize the LASSO penalty, however, any other penalties may be applied.

The extensive simulation study and real data analysis show that the absolute loss and two robust losses have excellent prediction performance compared with Square loss when data consist of heavy-tail errors. Therefore, appropriate loss function should be selected in the AFT model to obtain reliable estimation and prediction. The squared loss function is more suitable when the survival data is closed to normal after log transformation; whereas, the absolute loss function provides a better fit when the survival data is skewed and/or consisting of heavy-tail errors. The two robust loss functions demonstrate similar prediction performance that is in-between the square and absolute loss performances, hence may be appropriate for both scenarios with acceptable estimation and prediction results. Other types of loss function that are not compared in the simulation study can also be applied to the AFT model with our proposed E–M algorithm when more suitable.

The proposed method based on the AFT model can be extended to the additive model (AM) (Friedman and Stuetzle 1981) with general loss functions. It can also incorporate the group structure of predictors (the pathway information of genes) into the high-dimensional survival data analysis. For example, the doubly regularized penalty (Wu and Wang 2013) can be adopted in our object function to take into account of the gene pathway information.",0

"Conclusion
The prevalence rates and intensities of US vis a vis its impact on SAC, keep increasing from year to year, leading to increase in the global population requiring chemotherapeutic intervention with PZQ. In view of the WHO strategic ambitious plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2020 [43] and the findings from this review stipulating that in the last decade, a PZQ distribution coverage of 45% has never been achieved for SAC, it is obvious that this goal, in the face of realities, might not be achieved just like the strategic plan for 2010. Our view is in agreement with the report that if WHO sustains the current treatment trend, elimination is achievable in 2030 [44]. It is imperative that annual control programmes be scaled up marginally, particularly in the African region of the WHO. While US-based researches should be sponsored at the grass-root level to unveil hidden endemic foci, adequate facilities for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) should be put in place in all schools globally.",0

This review illustrates how antipsychotics can be effective on several pathways central
for neural stemness, development, function, metabolism and signal transduction, and how
all the MoAs we describe for these drugs also appear functional in controlling cancercell growth, notably GBM. This tumor is known to display a noticeable heterogeneity in
cell composition and possesses incredible plasticity, thus switching to a reprogrammed
cell population according to the selective pressure generated by the current therapeutic
approaches. This feature makes it predisposed to resistance to therapy [11,101]. Such a
GBM biological behavior makes possible the option of using “dirty drugs”, i.e., compounds
provided with pleiotropic and multifaceted MoAs (Figure 2), as antipsychotics definitely
are. These drugs can hit widespread vulnerabilities of cancer cells and spare noncancer
cells, due to a conceivably different toxicity pattern.",0

 Exploration of how fibrinolysis is affected, particularly
through D-dimer levels, constitutes a promising marker
of AE attacks. A threshold level of D-dimers was shown
to differentiate between an abdominal attack during bradykinin or mast cell-mediated AE and abdominal pain of
other aetiologies. Thus, D-dimers could be useful in the
emergency setting for patients with abdominal pain to
determine an AE diagnosis versus other aetiologies. VEcadherin, a protein marker of vascular stress, could not
distinguish between mast cell-related AE and bradykinin-mediated AE, but presented a characteristic peak

practice for the differential diagnosis of these two physiopathological forms of AE, the identification of which determines the patients’ therapeutic management.",0

This is likely to be related to the implant design, patient selection, surgical technique and the biomechanical demands that patients put on their implants following surgery. However, the representative contribution of these elements is unknown and should remain a focus of future research. It is however, vital that surgeons are aware of the risk profile of this surgery and counsel their patients appropriately.

Trauma appears to have higher complication rates and overall cumulative percentage compared to inflammatory arthritis as an indication. There is however a paucity of literature on the complication rates associated with each indication and none in osteoarthritis independently. High aseptic loosening rates at over 10% in less than five years, regardless of the implant or indication and high rates of deep infection compared to other implants should be communicated to patients as part of preoperative consent.

Surgeons should be aware of differing complications related to their implant of choice with each having its own specific set of complications featuring more frequently with its use.",0
"CONCLUSION
The number of mosquito population varies according to seasonal variations. During
favourable periods, when the size of the mosquito population increases, the potential for
dengue infection in the humans also increases. The potential for the dengue transmission
requires the following four factors: (1) a number of susceptible humans, (2) a number of
mosquitoes, (3) virus transmission potential, and (4) a suitable climate.
The temperature plays a significant role in the dengue transmission and influences
the dynamic modelling of vector–host interaction. The most suitable temperature for
the dengue transmission is 28.7 ◦C. Rainfall provides breeding sites for the mosquitoes
to hatch and develop into the adult stage. Both factors have a significant impact to the
mosquito population and the dengue transmission dynamics. Our simulations confirm
the impact of climate to dengue transmission is significant and suggest that the greatest
potential of dengue transmission in Thailand occur in June to August which average
temperature is 28–29 ◦C in the mid of rainy season. The mosquito population reach their
peak three months before the peak of infection of mosquito and human. This study shows
the impacts of climate especially temperature and seasonal variation to the transmission of
dengue virus",0

According to the recommended malaria treatment policy, both AS/AQ and AL are suitable drugs for first-line purpose since both drugs recorded excellent PCR-corrected efficacies (i.e., 96.4% and 100%, resp.) and safety/tolerability profiles in children in this study. AL, however, appeared better than AS/AQ for several outcomes such as rapid parasitological clearance, resolution of symptoms, and biological tolerance. Pharmacovigilance research is needed to monitor safety following extensive deployment, especially when the use is indicated for pregnant women and for those with malaria comorbidities who constitute another vulnerable group.",0

ASD is a severe, lifelong disorder with serious emotional and financial consequences. This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies is needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD. We recommended further studies to investigate the correlations between the clinical response of vitamin D and the biochemical changes in ASD patients.",0
"4. Conclusion
A 3D scanning device was used to scan the surface of fractured rock specimens and extract the surface characteristics. The specimens were fractured in a hydraulic fracturing experiment. The scanned data were processed to produce a shaded relief model of the fractured specimen, a 3D scanning image and a contour map of the fractured surface, generating a clear and detailed representation of the fracture morphology and propagation. A new method is proposed to quantitatively study hydraulic fracturing. Using the 3D coordinates extracted from the scanner, the superficial area of the fractured surface and volume of the fractured specimen can be derived for quantitative analysis. The 3D scanning device for coal rock specimens is an efficient diagnostic tool for hydraulic fracture experiments.",0
"Conclusion
Marijuana use, especially prolonged years of use,
may increase the risk of hypertension mortality.
This cardiovascular risk associated with marijuana
use, may be greater than the cardiovascular risk
already established for cigarette smoking. We are
not disputing the possible medicinal benefits of standardized cannabis formulations; however, recreational use of marijuana should be approached
with caution. It is possible that discouraging
recreational marijuana use may ultimately impact
reductions in mortality from cardiovascular causes.
A purposeful longitudinal study modeled with inclusion of listed relevant limitations is recommended to
help evaluate this cause.",0

"Conclusion
Recognizing the passage of the seasons is perhaps something taken for granted in the northern
or far southern latitudes because there are so many obvious signs. However, tropical environments—like at Monte Alegre just 2˚ south of the equator—do not have any of those telltale
higher lattitude signs. There are no major changes in temperature, no changes of precipitation
from rain to snow, no significantly shorter or longer days and nights, and no widespread coordinated shedding or color change of tree foliage. Therefore, the passage of the seasons—i.e. a
solar year—is perhaps most recognizable by tracking the migration of the sun between southern and northern solstices. To do this, however, one needs a clear view of the horizon—which
is usually difficult in a rainforest environment—but Monte Alegre provides the necessary elevation above the forest canopy to view the horizons.
For paleoindian cultures, the river would have been the most efficient mode of travel, the
hills at Monte Alegre offered lithic tools and horizon sightings, and once there, tracking the
sun through rock art pictographs and tally marks allowed for them to mark the cyclic passage
of time in a rudimentary calendar. Armed with this visual aide, the ancient Amazonians could
better predict and schedule subsistence and social activities, like resource acquisition and ritual
ceremonies.
The results of this research have implications on the development of traditional astronomy
knowledge systems extending to the terminal Pleistocene. This was a critical moment in history when our human ancestors were faced with rapid changes to the global climate. We do
not know the extent to which paleoindians recognized these changes, but it is during this time
period that Monte Alegre first shows evidence for paleoindians using rock paintings. I’ve
argued here that the context of the rock paintings indicate a method of recording seasonal sky

observations in pictographs with enough precision that it could have helped them predict
cyclic patterns of resource availability in the local environment.
Archaeoastronomy sites like at Painel do Pilão are pushing further back in antiquity the
evidence for human use of astronomy observations to marke the passage of time. And even
though specific rock drawings can not be pinpointed to over 13,000 years ago, this research
helps establish that tropical cultures engaged and utilized sophisticated knowledge of astronomy maintained through rock art and possibly shared or reimagined by more recent cultures
who either inherited or rediscovered the ancient paintings as they traveled far afield throughout eastern South America.
Beyond the art and archaeoasronomy, the recovery of lithics and the reduction of a platform wall during the paleoindian period shows that the interior of the South American continent was being inhabited as early or earlier than many coastal sites. And the preence of rock
art during that initial period suggests that rock art as a form of archaeorecording may have
been an adaptive strategy consistent with pioneers who sought to familiarize themselves to a
new landscape.
Similar astronomy lore [26–28] is found among more recent cultures for village orientation
and construction in Amazonia [24, 29–32] and the Andean regions of South America [33–36],
for the layout of many platform plaza constructions in Mesoamerica [26, 37–39], and for the
medicine wheels, gnomons, and sun dagger rock art of Sun-watcher chiefs in North America’s
southwest and plains cultures [40–43].",0
"In summary, fPMSC culture supernatant was demonstrated to exhibit antioxidant ability, and to a certain extent, to reduce the apoptosis induced by H2O2, at least in part via activation of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway. This suggested that for the clinical application of MSCs, in addition to the cells themselves, the culture supernatant may also have potential therapeutic value. In addition to its antioxidative effects, the supernatant of MSCs may have other beneficial functions, which require further investigation.",0
"Conclusions
This all-Nordic, population-based cohort study found decreasing risk estimates of esophageal adenocarcinoma after antireflux medication and antireflux surgery, with levels of risk almost the same as that of the background population 15 years or more after treatment. The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was stable over time after antireflux surgery compared with medication, indicating that these treatment alternatives may be similarly associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. These findings support the hypothesis that antireflux medication and antireflux surgery are associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with GERD.

"4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a new type biosensor for high
sensitive and specific method for mRNA in complex biological samples
by using GO-protected DNA probe and DSN cascade amplification. The
platform showed as effective intracellular probe for tumor-related
mRNA detection, with the ability of low cytotoxicity, high resistance to
enzymatic degradation, and cellular permeability. Using T1 mRNA as a
target model, the detection limit of T1 mRNA in vitro reached 1 fM.
These are three orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional
hybridization assays. In addition, the proposed method not only detect
mRNA in living cells, but also useful for monitoring the dynamic in situ
mRNA change. We anticipate that the platform with specific recognition element (such as HP1) could potentially be applied to detect intracellular mRNA and be useful for the early diagnosis and prognosis of
the cancers.",0

"In conclusion, this meta-analysis updated previous studies and identified that cancer risk in female population was increased with accumulating years of night shift work. Given the expanding prevalence of shift work worldwide and heavy public burden of cancers, further researches, particularly large-size, high-score cohort studies are of great necessity to confirm the relationship between night shift work and cancer risk. Also, in-depth biological researches should be done to explore the mechanisms by which night shift work affects cancer risk. Knowing how night shift work serves as a risk factor for cancers might help establish and implement effective measures to protect female night shifters. Moreover, it is important that long-term night shift workers accept regular physical examination and cancer screening for potential malignancies, particularly breast cancer.",0
"Conclusions
An analytical method for loxoprofen was developed as TBDMS derivative by GC–MS. Under optimized conditions, the linearity, repeatability and accuracy of this method were suitable for the determination of loxoprofen. When applied to commercial tablet and patch products, loxoprofen was positively identified without background effects and interference. Urinary loxoprofen levels were monitored as highest level at 0.5 and 1 h following a single oral administration to three horses and to fall below its LOQ at 24 h. Therefore, the present method will be useful for pharmacokinetic study and doping test of similar acidic drugs including loxoprofen in horses.",0
"In conclusion, LS-3-134 is a novel arylamide phenylpiperazine with
over 100-fold selectivity for D3Rs over D2Rs that produces a behavioral
profile similar to other D3R-selective partial agonists and antagonists
whereby motivation to seek cocaine appears to be attenuated. This
finding adds further support to pursuing D3Rs as a target for cocaine
dependence medications development. Given that sex differences have
been observed in dopamine systems (Becker, 1999; Jackson et al.,
2006), including D3R-mediated responses (Klinker et al., 2017; Liu
et al., 2017; Martelle et al., 2014), future studies are needed to assess
whether females exhibit similar responses to LS-3-134 as males. It will
also be important to determine whether the effects of LS-3-134 persist
with repeated treatments (John et al., 2015).",0

"Conclusions
In this study, we designed an approach for detecting closely linked multiple association signals and performed the analysis in Nordic Holstein cattle for milk, fat and protein yields. The results showed we not only detected most of the well-known genes affecting these three milk yield traits but also detected additional candidate genes. Post-GWAS, we used information from the mammalian phenotype database and variant effect predictor to confirm known genes and causative mutations. In the meanwhile, we detected additional genes which might be contributing to variation in milk traits in Nordic Holstein cattle. Therefore, we concluded our approach can be used routinely for GWAS studies in dairy cattle.",0

In conclusion, our data indicated that rHMGB1-induced platelet aggregation and secretion via TLR4 receptors, NF-kappa B, and cGMP depended activation of the GPIIb/IIIa pathway.

"The overall conclusion from these studies is that mammalian cells possess one or more specific transport systems for iron uptake in a transferrin-independent manner, but there is no consensus as to the molecular identity of the transporters responsible for these uptake processes. But none of the studies in the literature proposes an NTBI transporter that accepts Fe3+ as the substrate; involvement of ferri-reductases that convert Fe3+ to Fe2+ before uptake via either ZIP8/ZIP14 or some other NTBI transporter is implicated in all of these studies. In contrast, the present study focused on citrate uptake and the involvement of Fe3+ in this uptake process. This approach has uncovered the presence of a novel transport system for citrate in mammalian cells that operates only in the presence of Fe3+ as well as Na+ under physiological conditions.",0

Based on the above study from 18 to 24 months of clinical pooled outcome, we concluded that both the Superion and X-STOP interspinous spacers can relieve symptoms of LSS. In addition, the pooled results indicate that Superion shows advantage than X-STOP in axial pain severity and ZCQ patient satisfaction score, whereas similar in other outcomes. The Superion spacer may represent a promising spacer for patient with LSS owing to its nature of minimally invasive, easily operable, and less damage. Because of the advantage of IPS technique, it would win a wide place in the future degenerative lumbar microsurgery.",0
"Population-based strategies to prevent diabetes and high BMI have great potential impact—not least because many NCDs have overlapping risk factors, comorbidities, and shared sequelae—but have so far often failed, largely because of reluctance by governments and policy makers to pursue structural interventions that tackle key risks for NCDs, such as diet and physical inactivity.1 Future efforts should focus on identifying the most effective clinical interventions to prevent development of NCDs in at-risk groups and their sequelae, such as cancer. Primary care interventions, such as glucose-modifying medications, can be effective in preventing diabetes complications such as macrovascular disease,50 but this approach relies on early identification and close monitoring of people with diabetes, which can be challenging in LMICs that have limited resources. As well as coordinated approaches to halt and reverse the rise in NCDs, global efforts and clinical guidance should reflect the importance of cancer as a sequela of both diabetes and high BMI, and NCD control measures should be integrated into clinical guidelines to identify opportunities to reduce morbidity in this group of patients.",0
"In the present study, we demonstrate the excellent activity of Etest and disk diffusion for evaluation of the activity of C-T against a population of beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. The C-T MIC distribution for the isolates evaluated in this study reflects that documented in larger databases, including the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) data (https://mic.eucast.org/Eucast2/regShow.jsp?Id=36537). The highest probability of testing errors would be for those isolates with MICs near the breakpoint, i.e., 8 to 32 μg/ml, as slight downward differences in MICs may result in VMEs. However, such isolates are rare (6.6% of all P. aeruginosa included in the EUCAST database and 7.5% included in the present study). In contrast, the MTS had a tendency to yield MICs that were 1 to 2 log2 dilutions higher than rBMD MICs, and as such, laboratories may consider carefully evaluating isolates with MICs in the intermediate range if using MTS, as these may be susceptible by rBMD.",0

"Conclusions
Our genome-wide comparative analysis of a comprehensive set of expressed rice gene homologues in the 48 diverse eukaryotic species reveals information regarding the recently evolved rice-specific genes and the ancient genes conserved across eukaryotes. The presence of a common set of 98 conserved genes across diverse eukaryotic species underlined their role in the basic structural and metabolic functions and helped provide a clue regarding the origin and diversification of these species. A eukaryotic tree of life based on the comprehensive set of the conserved genes increases our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among different plant, animal, fungal, and protist species. The grouping of protists within diverse clades emphasises their broad distribution and close association with the 3 eukaryotic clades—plants, animals, and fungi. In particular, S. rosetta provided a link between fungal and animal species, T. gondii provides a link between fungal and plant species, and C. reinhardtii is the nearest to the plant clade. The use of a comprehensive set of conserved gene sequences for estimating synonymous substitution rates and integration of fossil information provides more accurate estimation of the divergence time among a large number of species pairs by minimising the uncertainty associated with considering a small set of genes. This study provides novel information on the phylogenetic distances between some species pairs.

"In summary, SRI36160 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and does not affect STAT3 or mTORC1 signaling in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. SRI36160 displays potent in vitro anticancer activity, and is significantly less antiproliferative to non-cancerous cells. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated with cancer stem cell tumorigenic properties and the ability to self-renew, form differentiated progeny, and develop resistance to therapy [1, 9, 18]. When cancer cells were exposed to this compound in conditions designed to enrich for CICs, a more profound activity against cancer cell proliferation was observed. Our findings support the notion that selective inhibition of the Wnt/β pathway may provide a novel therapeutic approach for Wnt-dependent cancers.",0

In conclusion, we found that ANGPTL4 promoted MSCs survival under conditions that mimic those of the ischemic myocardium. It is likely that ANGPTL4 resists mitochondrial pre-apoptotic changes through integrin-dependent ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways, mimicking pathways activated when cells contacting with the ECM. Our findings propose a new way to protect MSCs from apoptosis, have a considerable therapeutic significance and provide the potential of now exploiting ANGPTL4 and MSCs clinically in cardiac regeneration therapies.",0

"4. Discussion and Conclusion
Many studies were published on the role of complementary and alternative medicines in treating cancer patients. Some studies support the CAM therapies to be beneficial for palliative cancer cares [30–35]. However, very few of the published reports support their efficacy with regard to the primary care of cancer. According to our knowledge, the clinical study, reported here, is the only prospective study that intrigued a fair number of complete and partial tumor responses along with impressive survival outcomes in treating patients with stomach, gall bladder, pancreatic, and liver cancers through psorinum therapy. Previously, interviews were conducted on 300 biopsy-proved cancer patients of Psorinum Therapy. The primary purpose of the study was to ascertain the patients' and/or their caregivers' view on this CAM therapy. The survey showed the patients had tried Psorinum Therapy mainly due to no other available treatment options, financial constraints, frustration with the conventional cancer treatments, and belief in the efficacy of the Psorinum Therapy. According to the survey, among the 300 cancer patients, 195 (65%) had consulted their oncologists before trying the therapy [17]. This therapy can be easily replicated by other practitioners in different clinical centers due to the following advantages.

The reagent to prepare the drug Psorinum is available. The specific dosing and the medicinal power are established. The medicine administration technique is easy as it can be taken orally.

The supportive treatments are adopted from the allopathic streams. The supportive treatments with homeopathic medicines are done by specific ailment versus specific medicine concept instead of the concept of specific patient versus specific medicine, making the homeopathic supportive cares easier to replicate. In a nutshell, we should remember that, 158 participants of histopathology or cytopathology confirmed stomach, gall bladder, pancreatic, and liver cancers were included in the final analysis at the end of the study. According to the AJCC TNM staging system, 39 (24.68%) were diagnosed at stage-III and 112 (70.89%) were diagnosed at stage-IV. The participants Karnofsky status was between 30–60% and ECOGstatus was between 2-3. The participants received the drug Psorinum along with allopathic and homeopathic supportive treatments without trying conventional or any other investigational cancer treatments. According to the RECIST criteria, radiological complete response occurred in 28 (17.72%) and partial response occurred in 56 (35.44%) participants. The limitation of this study is that it did not have any placebo or treatment control arm; therefore, it cannot be concluded that Psorinum Therapy is effective in improving the survival and the quality of life of the participants due to the academic rigours of the scientific clinical trials. This study also cannot rule out the effects of the implemented allopathic and homeopathic supportive measures in the observed results. However, the results of the study showed a fair number of complete and partial tumor responses along with impressive survival outcomes in difficult to treat cancer types. Therefore, randomized double-blind clinical trial, detailed molecular, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics studies should be conducted for further scientific exploration of this alternative cancer treatment to determine if it can be integrated into the mainstream oncology.

"In the end we discuss three countermeasures. The first one is that Alice uses an active phase randomization equipment30,31 to ensure that the phase of source is totally randomized, then our attack is automatically removed. Obviously, this method is the best way for Alice, since it can remove not only our hybrid measurement attack but also other undiscovered attacks based on the random phase of sources, but it may increase the complexity of the system, or introduce other potential and undiscovered loopholes. Note that even an active phase randomization equipment is used by Alice, it is still necessary for her to check the degree of phase randomization in the communication program (but not calibrate it before the communication) to ensure that the phase of source is really randomized in [0, 2π) and Eve does not break the efficiency of her active phase randomization equipment. The second one is that the legitimate parties carefully design the system parameters to ensure that Eve can not load our attack in these parameter regimes. This method is valid for our hybrid measurement attack, since they know which parameter regimes are secure if they clearly know the parameters of their system, but there may exist other potential hacking strategies so that Eve can also exploit the partially random phase to spy the final key in other parameter regimes. The third one is that the legitimate parties carefully monitor the experimental data but not only estimate the key rate with these experimental data. For example, they can check the rate of gain Qμ/Qν. In the parameters of Fig. 3, Qμ/Qν ≈ μ/ν = 4.8 when Eve is absent, but this rate will be changed to Qμ/Qν ≈ 7.79 when Eve is present, which is higher than the expectation 4.8.

"4. Conclusions
The goal of this study was to understand the effect of DSS on Caco-2 cell metabolism. Although cell viability was similar, and IL-6 production was increased approximately 1.5 times, the only major metabolite difference observed when Caco-2 cells were incubated with 1% DSS was a decrease in alanine concentration in the cell culture medium as compared with controls. Since the concentration of glutamine and other amino acids were unaffected, we ruled out the possibility that DSS inhibited alanine transport across the membrane. These results suggest that either transcription of alanine aminotransferase is inhibited, or the enzyme itself is inhibited. This study emphasizes that alanine aminotransferase has a direct relationship with inflammatory bowel disease, and in particular CD, and may provide a more thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of CD in addition to the metabolic mechanisms for DSS-induced colitis in animal models. Work is currently under way to determine how alanine aminotransferase is inhibited by DSS.",0

Further, it suggests that those who have suffered a nerve injury or other types of peripheral nerve pathology may be prone to RF EMF-induced pain. The fact that uninjured animals showed no response to RF EMF in this study is also in agreement with most scientific reports and the overwhelming view that, under normal circumstances, anthropogenic EMFs in the reported range causes no pain. Thus, this study offers a possible explanation for contradicting accounts on evoked pain by RF EMF and highlights nerve pathology as the crucial contributing factor to RF EMF-induced symptoms. These findings may prove valuable in developing a patient’s pain management protocol and inform future studies of EMF-pain phenotyping.",0

Interventions to encourage moving from high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with elevated major depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced major depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes in light of these sex differences.",0
"Conclusions
(1) During the pure MSS fly ash thermal treatment, approximately 80 to 89% of Pb, 48 to 56% of Cd, 27 to 36% of Zn and 6 to 24% of Cu were volatilized. During this process, temperature was an important parameter and had significant influence on the volatilization of heavy metals, whereas residence time had the weakest effect, particularly for Pb and Cd, which easily volatize.

(2) Chlorinating agents exhibited an apparent promoting effect on heavy metals removal, particularly for the mid-volatile metals, Cu and Zn. With an addition of 10 wt% chlorinating agents, more than 96% of Pb, 78% of Cd, 76% of Zn (except NaCl) and 86% of Cu (except NaCl) can be removed from MSS ash. With an increase in Cl proportion, the evaporation rate of the heavy metals increased; however, the effect clearly varied. The NaCl had the weakest enhancement effect on the evaporation rate of Cd, Zn and Cu.

(3) The best choice of chlorinating agents is in the order of MgCl2 > CaCl2 > FeCl3 > AlCl3 > NaCl due to the metal removals (particularly Zn) and the low amount of remaining chlorine, which favors treated ash for further resource use or disposal.",0
"5. Conclusion
MI-3DVS-guided hepatectomy should be considered as the primary treatment for HCC patients with multifocal disease, higher AFP level, and preserved liver function within the Milan criteria. However, for older candidates, RFA can be considered as an alternative therapy, as it could lead to comparable survival but shorter hospital stay and lower incidence of complications. Intervention, tumor number, and serum AFP are important and independent prognostic predictors of both survival and recurrence.",0

"Conclusion
A major challenge in schizophrenia research has been identifying and characterizing the complex neurobiological effects of multiple conjoined genetic variants contributing to disease risk. Leveraging the combined power of neuroimaging and GWAS, this study supports a role for genes involved in synapse organization and function in prefrontal–hippocampal interactions. Several genes in this pathway are highly consistent with the reported risk architecture of schizophrenia, and we provide independent evidence for the intermediate phenotype concept. In addition, we identify genes that are strongly implicated in the schizophrenia pathophysiology but have not been identified by classic genetic association studies. Our findings highlight the value of this biologically driven method in determining the mechanisms and genes underlying intermediate systems-level neural phenotypes linked to psychiatric disorders and should be generalized to other phenotypes and disorders of interest. We expect that a more pathway-oriented approach will also be helpful in linking up systems-level observations in humans with drug development in psychiatric disorders.",0

"In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates an antidepressant-like effect of YL-0919, which is produced by ameliorating HPA axis dysfunction and improving the behavioral deficits induced by CUS. Furthermore, the effects of YL-0919 on the behavioral deficits induced by CUS may be related to the enhancement of dendritic complexity in terms of both node number and dendritic length. Moreover, the data presented herein suggest that the pCREB/CREB and BDNF protein levels in the brain are increased, specifically in the hippocampus. These findings support the potential therapeutic application of YL-0919 as an antidepressant. The methods presented herein were limited due to the ethological and biochemical parameters of the CUS model used in this study. Other animal models of depression and specific inhibitors that target the main regulated molecules should be utilized and verified through diverse methods. Further studies are currently being conducted in our laboratory to confirm whether and how the antidepressant effects of YL-0919 are related to synaptic plasticity, as well as to determine the molecular mechanisms of the HPA axis. Molecular biochemical methodology is being employed to take advantage of the pros and cons of knock-in and knock-down in vitro and in vivo models.",1

"I would like to thank you for the opportunity to read Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) study and for offering insightful comments. Each research study may face limitations that could be overcomed in future studies, which is why research is a cyclic process. Honestly, when the reality is talking, efforts that were made to conduct Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper were much more than what was written here or in their original paper. Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) study is large and complex and consequently may face more limitations than simpler or more straightforward studies.

Eljarrah and Rababa (2022) included 18 studies that could offer a broad understanding of this topic by considering diverse contextual factors involving diverse study designs. Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) main motivation was to accomplish their review aim; years were spent conducting this review. To my knowledge, this is the first review of integrating diverse designs that has been conducted in this area. I believe that the strengths of Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) study far exceed the weaknesses to accomplish the main aim. Discussing each study's characteristics and appraisal levels by the two authors could offer a broad understanding of the topic and the nature of the available evidence. Another strength of this paper is including the contextual factors associated with smartphone radiation, as well as diverse sources of EMF that the reader can consider while interpreting the findings and drawing a conclusion. The limitations of each study were explicitly presented in the text and tables of Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper. The decision to combine diverse designs represents a major strength of this review since they increase the understanding of such a rare and complex topic to accomplish the main aim of this review. Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper included studies of diverse designs and followed the strategies of systematic reviews, but Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper has an overlap in how to conceptualize the title in terms of systematic reviews of mixed study designs. I acknowledge that Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper offers an integrative review of the final work. To remove any overlap and complexities, in the future update, the title will be updated to ""Integrative Review."" In the conclusion part, this sentence will be added ""Overall, findings of this review should be taken cautiously and cannot be used to formulate policy at this point in time, highlighting a need to more thoroughly assess smartphone radiation and its impact on pregnancy. Because of including studies of 1) diverse designs, 2) diverse contextual factors, 3) conflicting evidence, and 4) low exposure assessment, it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion."" Future researchers could use studies in Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper to prepare more than one systematic review or a separate systematic review involving a meta-analysis, taking into account a wide variety of contextual factors for each review. They could also add more studies to those reviews. Future studies could differentiate between the smartphone and other mobile device concepts. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of technology use, it is noteworthy to assess new challenges that studies face in terms of EMF exposure assessment. While Eljarrah and Rababa's (2022) paper recognizes that smartphone exposure might be an environmental risk factor, it stands by its reported and explicit conclusion of ""inadequate evidence"" in the area and presents evidence that encourages the reader to take contextual factors and each study characteristics into account while interpreting the findings.

"Collectively, our study revealed that the expression of miR-130b-5p was significantly up-regulated in activated HSCs and liver fibrosis models. miR-130b-5p, as a pro-fibrotic factor, promoted the expression of pro-fibrotic markers and HSC activation by targeting SIRT4 via the AMPK/TGF-β/Smad2/3 signalling pathway (Figure 8). Furthermore, antagomiR-130b-5p ameliorated liver fibrosis and promoted SIRT4 expression in animal models. Indeed, lack of substantial molecular mechanism, how SIRT4 activate AMPK, is one of the limitations of our study. We would address this question in our future research. In general, our study revealed a mechanism by which miR-130b-5p is involved in the activation of HSCs, and it offers a possible miRNA-based therapeutic strategy for alleviating hepatic fibrosis.",1
"Conclusions
The study found that there is an association between smoking and hearing problems, and unlike tinnitus, there was no clear evidence of an association. The results also indicated a significant influence of demographic factors, as these factors showed differences in the hearing health status of smokers compared to non-smokers.

Based on the conclusion, several recommendations can be made to further investigate the link between smoking and hearing problems. Firstly, more studies should be conducted to determine the specific types of hearing problems associated with smoking, such as reduced hearing sensitivity or difficulty understanding speech. Secondly, demographic factors that impact hearing problems and tinnitus should be further specified, with larger sample sizes and more detailed data collection methods. Thirdly, health awareness and promotion specialists should develop targeted educational materials and resources for patients who smoke or have hearing problems to highlight the link between smoking and hearing problems. Fourthly, ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctors should routinely screen patients for smoking and hearing problems and provide smoking cessation counseling as part of their practice. Fifthly, awareness campaigns and smoking cessation sessions should be tailored to specific populations, such as adolescents or pregnant women, who may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of smoking on hearing. Lastly, longitudinal studies should be conducted to determine whether quitting smoking can improve hearing outcomes over time. By following these recommendations, it is hoped that a better understanding of the link between smoking and hearing problems can be established, and effective interventions can be developed to improve hearing outcomes in smokers.

"6. Conclusions and Implication
6.1. Conclusions
With the digital change and Industrial Revolution 4.0 driving the osmosis of digital
learning and information technology in all areas of the society [51–53], and according to
practical examination enterprises of low carbon change, we selected 112 highly energyintensive enterprises in China from 2007–2019 as the observation sample. We incorporated
the effect of digitalization level on CO2 release into the study and explored the regulation
mechanism of enterprise technology innovation on digitalization level affecting enterprise
carbon emissions. The study determined that:
(1) The digitalization levels of firms have an “inverted U” effect on carbon emissions
and that after the inflection point the carbon release by firms decreases as the digitalization level increases; the effect has heterogeneous; the carbon release by non-SOEs are
less influenced by the digitalization level than those of SOEs; and the carbon release of
enterprises in the central region are more influenced by the digitalization level than those
in the non-central areas.
(2) Enterprise technical innovation has a reinforcing moderating action on digitalization level to promote a decrease in enterprise carbon release; under the impact of enterprise
technology innovation, the digitalization level will show the inhibiting influence on carbon release in advance, but the impact is limited at present, which means the progress of
Chinese digital economy still needs to be strengthened [54].
(3) The empirical research on the threshold pattern found that when the enterprise
technological innovation reaches a certain level, the digitalization level makes a greater
contribution to decreasing enterprise carbon release.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 15549 16 of 19
6.2. Implications
According to findings of this paper, from the research object’s point of view, the
majority of current discussions on carbon reduction come from the macro level, such as
carbon reduction studies in various provinces and regions, but this paper focuses on highly
energy-intensive enterprises. Secondly, according to the research method, the bond between
digitalization level and carbon release is an “inverted U”, differing from the simple linear
connection found in the existing literature and providing empirical evidence to support the
development of digitalization levels. Considering the moderating and threshold effects
of technological innovation, it is clearly possible to accelerate the process of digitalization
levels inhibiting the carbon emissions of enterprises.
To make the goal of carbon reduction development come true and to help China
achieve the target of carbon peaking and carbon balance, we need to improve the digitalization level of highly energy-intensive enterprises through various means. At the
micro-enterprise level, the progress of digital economy should be accelerated. Firstly, we
can add to the construction of infrastructure to carry digital technology platforms, lay
out new infrastructure in a targeted manner, and establish digital management platforms
and development platforms for enterprises [45]. Additionally, we can raise digital management levels and operation within enterprises, promote the change and escalation of
the traditional industrial chain, and accelerate the formation of a digital management
systems with data mining, analysis, and application as the core [55]. Secondly, management experience and strengthened staff training need to be introduced. Enterprises can
improve the motivation and efficiency of employees by introducing advanced management
experience and conducting regular training on digital technology for employees. Thirdly,
we should increase the investment in technology and scientific innovation in the digital
field. As the digital development stage has certain energy consumption characteristics,
while vigorously developing enterprise digitalization, we should avoid extensive growth.
We can also introduce advanced low-carbon technology and increase the investment in
R&D, strengthen the training of digital talents, and maximize cooperation between research
institutes, business, and research universities to develop more talent for the future digital
development of enterprises [56,57].
Macro national policy implementation can introduce policies that can inspire firms to
complete digital transformation. The state should combine the characteristics of industry
development and increase policy support, such as introducing preferential policies to encourage low-carbon adoption by firms, and improving the enthusiasm of firms, especially
state enterprises. Furthermore, considering the regional heterogeneity of firms, differentiated and targeted incentives and subsidy policies that help enterprises in different regions
to successfully achieve low-carbon changes need to be implemented. Reforms to the market
mechanism for SOEs and non-SOEs, such as the carbon emission trading mechanism to
eliminate outdated and inefficient enterprises and effectively realize supply-side reform,
also need to be promoted [26]. Finally, we should increase funding assistance for the technological innovation behavior of firms as well as protection property rights, create a fair
market environment to improve the aggressiveness of firms for technological innovation
in energy saving and emission decrease, and encourage firms to realize breakthroughs
in low-carbon technologies, production processes, and research and development of
production equipment.
6.3. Limitations
The digital economy in China is developing faster and faster, and the impact of
digitalization level on enterprises is deepening. Due to the immaturity of digitalization
level measurement methods and the limitation of industry-level data acquisition and digital
economy statistics, this paper has some limitations. This paper focuses on the empirical
study of the bearing of digitalization on the carbon release of firms with high energy
consumption and only proposes qualitative judgment and research hypotheses regarding
digitalization on firms’ carbon release, but it does not study the mechanism of the influence
Sustainability 2023, 15, 15549 17 of 19
of digitalization on firms’ carbon release. In the future, there will be a need to carry out an
in-depth theoretical exercise in order to grasp more comprehensively and systematically
the effect of digitalization on the promotion of the “double carbon” target.

"In conclusion, Dmab displayed positive impact and significant improvements in all sarcopenia measures and enhanced multidirectional agility as depicted by TUG. Collectively, this would reflect and explain the reduction of falls risk associated with Dmab therapy. Osteoporosis and sarcopenia share similar risk factors, highlighting muscle‐bone interactions, which may result in falls and fractures. RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway, which is a key regulator of bone homeostasis, may contribute also to the regulation of skeletal muscle integrity and function. In addition to its role as a treatment for osteoporosis, Dmab could be considered a novel therapeutic approach for sarcopenia. Consequently, Dmab can be considered as a first osteoporosis therapeutic option in this group of patients presenting with osteosarcopenia manifestations. Measures should be considered to maintain the positive Dmab effects on muscle strength and physical performance after stopping the treatment.",1
"Conclusions and future directions
The overwhelming benefit of endovascular thrombectomy
in the early and late time window seen in anterior
circulation ischaemic strokes has now been shown in
the posterior circulation. The 2019 American Stroke
Association guidelines29 state that endovascular
thrombectomy might be reasonable in selected patients,
and the 2019 European Stroke Organisation guidelines30
advise that endovascular thrombectomy should be
strongly considered. These guidelines are likely to be
updated to reflect the most recent trial results. The
Australian and New Zealand living guidelines already
reflect the latest data.31 The benefit of endovascular
thrombectomy is less certain in patients with basilar artery
occlusion presenting with NIHSS less than 10 than in
those with NIHSS of at least 10. Although further research
is warranted, the low NIHSS population is probably a
heterogeneous group in whom additional clinical testing17
and advanced imaging32 might be necessary to identify
patients with potentially disabling symptoms or who are
at risk of subsequent clinical deterioration and would
benefit from immediate endovascular thrombectomy.
Endovascular therapy is highly effective but resource
intensive, and access is currently restricted in many
countries. Therefore, intravenous thrombolytic therapies
remain the standard of care in basilar artery occlusion,
particularly in patients who initially present to a primary
stroke centre without the capacity to perform endovascular thrombectomy. Extending intravenous
thrombolysis use beyond 4·5 h after symptom onset in
patients with basilar artery occlusion is practised in some
centres and is the subject of an ongoing randomised trial
(NCT05105633) that is testing tenecteplase, a potentially
more effective thrombolytic therapy than alteplase.33,34
Notably, the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was low (0–1%) in the medical arm of all four
endovascular thrombectomy trials,7–10 including the
BASICS trial, in which 79% of patients were treated with
intravenous thrombolysis, and lower than the risk
reported in anterior circulation stroke,1,2,19 which supports
the safety of extending intravenous thrombolysis beyond
4·5 h.Wider use of thrombolytic therapies in an extended
time window in basilar artery occlusion, analogous
to what has proven effective for anterior circulation
strokes,35,36 could greatly expand access to reperfusion
therapies for patients requiring long transfers to an
endovascularcapable centre or in settings where
endovascular therapy is not widely available, including
lowincome countries.
Given the powerful treatment effect of endovascular
thrombectomy, caution is required when considering the
exclusion of patients from endovascular thrombectomy
on the basis of imaging profiles in both early and extended
time windows. Noncontrast CT assessment of the
brainstem is challenged by beamhardening artifacts.
Therefore, dedicated training programmes to assess
imaging prognostic markers in patients with basilar
artery occlusion might be useful in clinical practice.
Furthermore, automated software with artificial intelligence and machinelearning approaches that aid
detection of ischaemic changes might improve the

diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of validated imaging
scores in the posterior circulation.37 Dedicated training
programmes and automated software could assist
clinicians with the diagnosis of this condition, which can
be challenging when fluctuating symptoms are present at
onset, and with the identification of patients who are
more likely to benefit from reperfusion therapies in the
early and extended time window.
Device technology is continuing to evolve and might
further improve treatment response in patients with
basilar artery occlusion. Observational data suggested
that a firstline aspiration approach might achieve higher
recanalisation rates than would stent retrievers.38 Balloon
guide catheters are less applicable in the posterior
circulation due to size constraints and difficulty
controlling flow from the contralateral vertebral artery.39
A randomised controlled trial addressing this question is
ongoing (NCT05320263).
To optimise patient outcomes, endovascular thrombectomy needs to be delivered as part of a holistic, high
quality system of care across the continuum, from early
recognition to expedited transport to a hospital, improved
neuroimaging markers to select patients for reperfusion
therapies, organised care in the stroke unit, prevention of
postprocedure complications, and effective rehabilitation
and neurorecovery approaches. In this context, mobile
stroke units might have an increasing role in prehospital
triage, as evidence for their effectiveness mounts,40 and
could facilitate earlier delivery of thrombolysis in patients
with basilar artery occlusion. Tools for the recognition of
large vessel occlusion in the prehospital setting to deliver
faster treatment,41 adjuvant therapies to reduce the degree
of ischaemic injury and improve collateral blood flow,
and agents to reduce secondary injury42,43 are all under
active investigation in anterior circulation strokes.
Further efforts are required to include patients with
basilar artery occlusion in these clinical trials and address
current knowledge gaps and unmet needs in this field.44
Given the rarity of basilar artery occlusion, heterogeneity
of clinical presentation, and the poor natural history, the
Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase
for articles published in any language between Jan 1, 2015,
and Nov 1, 2022. We used the search terms “ischaemic/
ischemic stroke”, “basilar”, “endovascular thrombectomy/
mechanical thrombectomy/thrombectomy”, and “clinical
trial” or “meta-analysis”. We searched the reference lists of
articles identified by this search strategy and selected those
that we judged to be relevant. We largely selected those
published within the 12 months before our search, but did
not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded
publications that were older. Review articles are cited to
provide readers with more details and references than those
included in this Rapid Review.
conduct of clinical trials remains challenging. Therefore,
the contribution of observational data to inform the
design of future clinical trials is paramount. More efforts
to build large international research networks are
required so that clinical trials on rare diseases, such as
basilar artery occlusion, can achieve rapid and
consecutive enrolment and a more diverse ethnic
representation to increase the generalisability of results.",1
"Conclusions
In this cohort study, we found an association between HL and risk of dementia, especially among people who did not use hearing aids. Although the clinical relevance of these findings is still unclear, the study results suggest that treatment of HL with hearing aids may be associated with reduced risk of dementia, which calls for a better understanding of the association between HL and dementia as a critical step for the development of prevention strategies. Although we found that HL was associated with increased risk of dementia, the increase in risk observed was considerably lower than in previous studies, highlighting the need for more high-quality longitudinal studies so that the clinical relevance of this association can be determined.",1

The standardized ELISA method is the best so far considering its ability to measure both qualitative and quantitative variables, it requires less time, it is easier to perform, it has high sensitivity and specificity, and is also readily available and affordable commercially.

Serum or urine samples should be used to determine the level of anti-PLA2R/anti-THSD7A to make a diagnosis, monitor patients’ treatment, and to determine the prognosis especially among patients who cannot withstand renal biopsy. Serum and urine samples can determine when to commence or stop immunosuppressive therapy.

"Conclusions
At the end of the 90-90-90 cascade, patients who fail to achieve viral suppression while taking ART enter the “failure care cascade” on the way to viral resuppression. In our study, conducted in nurse-led facilities in rural Lesotho, overall outcome of this cascade was poor with only 41% being in care with resuppressed VL at 18 months’ follow-up. Substantial numbers of patients were lost at each step along the continuum of care leading from first detection of unsuppressed VL to attendance of EAC, follow-up VL, switch to second-line ART and viral resuppression under the new second-line regimen. Achieving viral resuppression after adherence counselling and being switched to second line in case of ongoing viremia despite adherence counselling were associated with a favourable outcome at 18 months’ follow-up. In parallel to further scaling up of first-line ART provision, HIV programmes must develop strategies and allocate resources for those patients who at the end of the 90-90-90 cascade cannot achieve viral suppression and enter the “failure care cascade”. Ensuring timely EAC and switch to second-line ART in case of sustained unsuppressed VL are key for this vulnerable group of patients.",1

"Conclusions
This study showed that there are 10 articles from three databases that discuss nursing interventions in reducing the impact of traumatic experiences on victims of sexual violence. The methods used in the nursing interventions are cognitive behavior, counseling, and web-based intervention. Activities carried out in the form of psychoeducation, physical activity, meditation for relaxation, daily journals, and problem solving discussions. Nurses have an important role to be facilitators, educators, and counselors in every activity carried out. The implication of this study is that there is a basis for nurses to intervene in victims of sexual violence to reduce the impact of the traumatic experience they experience. In addition, this intervention can also be used as material in making policies on sexual violence by the government and health services. Suggestion for future research are the need for research on the impact of sexual violence experienced by women and the effect of the nursing interventions by women nurses to reduce the negative effect of sexual violence on women with victims of sexual violence.

"Conclusion
The mitogenomes sequences of the two species (S. robustus and B. nototaenia) from the family Cichlidae were determined and compared alongside with those of other Chordata Species. Their complete mitogenomes indicate typical circular molecules and had similar genome organization and structure as those found in other Cichlids species. The length of the mitogenome sequences of S. robustus and B. nototaenia were 16,583 and 16,580 bp, respectively. Each mitogenome consists of a typical structure of 13 PCGs, 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNA genes, and one non-coding region. Similar to other vertebrate mitogenomes, most of the PCGs utilized as their initiation codons, except for cox1 which utilizes GTG. Additionally, 11 tRNA genes in B. nototaenia and 9 tRNA genes in S. robustus species, folded correctly into typical clover-leaf secondary structures created by the regions of self-complementarity with the exception of {His (11768-11836) and Met (3967-4035)} and {His (11770-11838), Leu (7909-7982), and Met (3969-4037)} in B. nototeania and S. robustus, respectively that lacked the acceptor arm and Phe (1-69) with short acceptor arm of 2-base long in S. rubustus. The presence of two unusual tRNAs secondary structures, one with 4-loops and another without the T-arm and D-loop {Leu (7907-7980), and Asn (5225-5297)} and {Leu (7909-7982), and Asn (5227-5299)} were identified in both B. nototaenia and S. robustus, respectively. All the 22 tRNA genes in both species lacked variable loop. The phylogenetic analysis using 13 concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding genes indicates that S. robustus and B. nototaenia had wide phylogenetic relationship. Comparison with other established mitogenomes suggests a close relationship between B. nototaenia, C. quadrimaculatus, and P. longimanus and a lineage of S. robustus and A. geoffreyi relatively distinct from B. nototaenia.",1
"In summary, we provided the first evidence that human SAA dramatically upregulates the
expression and secretion of sPLA2-IIE and sPLA2-V in murine macrophage cultures. Furthermore, HDL dose-dependently attenuated SAA-induced secretion of sPLA2-IIE, sPLA2-V,
HMGB1 and NO, reinforcing the notion that sPLA2 may potentiate the production of various
late proinflammatory mediators. In addition, HDL attenuated SAA-induced secretion of a few
TLR4-dependent cytokines (e.g., IL-6) and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1 and RANTES). It now
appears that HDL counter-regulates SAA action by impairing its engagement with various
receptors with different efficiencies. It is thus important to continue to elucidate how HDL
counter-regulates SAA and other proinflammatory mediators in order to develop novel therapeutic strategy for various inflammatory diseases.",1

Compared with PCR, no requirement of precise control of thermal cycling (thus no need of sophisticated thermal cyclers) should be a great advantage, especially in point-of-care molecular diagnostics and high-throughput systems. Comparing with other exponential nucleic-acid amplification reactions, PG–RCA generates ‘primers’ during the reaction, thereby being free from troublesome design and usage of exogenous primers. The reaction design of PG–RCA is much simpler than the other isothermal amplification methods since the circular probe is required to have only primer hybridization and nicking sequences.

PG–RCA is applicable to various molecular diagnostic assays by simply designing nucleic-acid probes to initiate the cascade reaction of PG–RCA on target molecule recognition. For example, specific gene sequences of genomic DNA can be detected sensitively and specifically by PG–RCA as long as the sequences include nicking sites. The same assay scheme may be applicable to specific RNA sequence detection since nicking reaction of DNA strands in DNA/RNA hybrids was recently reported (17). Alternatively, PG–RCA can be combined with nucleic-acid probe technology such as cycling probe and invader probe to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences and generate specific 3′-end sequence for PG–RCA detection (18–20). When it is combined with aptamer or 3′-end sequence-labeled antibody, PG–RCA may be applicable to specific protein detection like immuno-RCA and proximity ligation assay (21,22). Furthermore, as PG–RCA can distinguish relatively short nucleotide sequences specifically, highly multiplexed reaction may be possible by designing circular probes with different sequences around nicking sites to avoid cross reaction among those probes. Multiplex capacity may depend on the cross reactivity among circular probes when only a single nicking enzyme is used, however use of multiple nicking enzymes could increase the multiplex capacity further.

"The results presented herein, however, clearly demonstrate that expression of Scarb1 in
osteoblasts is not required for bone mass acquisition and therefore is not an essential mediator
of the deleterious effects of PC-OxPL in osteoblasts. It remains possible that OxPLs exert their
anti-osteogenic effects indirectly via activation of Scarb1 in other cell types, possibly macrophages that produce anti-osteoblastogenic cytokines such as TNF-α [29]. In addition,
PC-OxPL is recognized by other scavenger receptors, such as CD36, and toll-like receptors,
such as TLR2, 4 and 6. Therefore, another potential explanation for the lack of a skeletal phenotype in the absence of Scarb1 in osteoblasts progenitors is that other scavenger receptors or
toll-like receptors are involved in the deleterious effects of PC-OxPL on bone formation, either
directly or indirectly, via other cell types such as macrophages. Thus, identification of the
mechanisms by which PC-OxPL affect osteoblasts will require further investigation.",1
"In conclusion, the evidence described herein strongly suggests that OxPL restrain normal bone anabolism in both cortical
and trabecular bone, at least during the first 6 months of life in
male and female mice. The adverse effects of OxPL in bone
homeostasis likely result from their ability to decrease osteoblast
number and function, and perhaps increase osteoclast function
at some sites. In addition, our findings indicate that OxPL promote osteoblast apoptosis and reduce osteoblast differentiation
from precursors via Scarb1. E06, therefore, stimulates bone anabolism in healthy young mice, at least in part, by neutralizing OxPL
and blocking their pro-apoptotic effects on mature osteoblasts
and/or their precursors. For this reason, targeting OxPL by EO6
provides proof of principle for a novel therapeutic approach to
bone anabolism.",1
"Concluding remarks
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based cohort study that specifically examines maternal drug uses in China. It provides a unique opportunity to monitor and evaluate the safety of drug use through the pregnancy life course in the Chinese setting, which is very unlikely to establish without a population-based database. Meanwhile, there are substantial differences in drugs, treatment strategies, underlying diseases and ethnicity disparity, compared with those in developed countries. This cohort study will also offer the important opportunity to examine issues about herbal medicines used during pregnancy, which were rarely investigated but in a strong need for in-depth evaluation in view of safety concerns [37, 38].

In the DEEP cohort, we exclusively developed a population-based prescriptions database to link the pregnancy database, thus the DEEP cohort documented highly detailed, full-range drug uses through pregnancy. It includes drugs used both in outpatient and inpatient departments from health care institutions, and all the drugs prescribed both in maternal departments and other clinical departments were included in the cohort. Besides, it has the capacity to explore drug use in the first few weeks after conception – the sensitive period for organogenesis. In contrast, the past cohort studies usually enrolled pregnant woman from the first antenatal visit, making it difficult to collect data on earlier prescriptions. These advantages in drug coverage would facilitate the exploration of safety in a much wider perspective. In addition, these drugs were identified from the prescription database, thus avoiding recall bias derived from patient-reporting of drug use, which is common in drug safety studies during pregnancy [9].

Third, this cohort acquired a comprehensive array of pregnancy outcomes related to maternal drug use, which not only include congenital malformations in live birth, but also the competing outcomes and long-term outcomes, such as miscarriage, stillbirth/fetal death and development disorders in childhood. The availability of such data would be very helpful in addressing competing risk when evaluating the association of maternal drug use with birth defects.

Meanwhile, we have accumulated a large number of pregnancies in cohort, thus providing the basis for obtaining the rare outcome with very low incidence (e.g., congenital malformations). Notably, our cohort have documented more than 800 variables, thus providing the possibility of adjusting for measured and unmeasured confounders by using advanced methods (e.g., high dimensional propensity scoring) [39]. In particular, the high dimensional data would also allow for the design of negative control, negative outcome, and sibling cohorts [23, 24], which are the important approaches for controlling confounding and bias when examining the association between maternal drug use and adverse outcomes.

This study also has some limitations. First, we do not have access to data on medicines from retail pharmacies, which may lead to an underestimation of drug exposure during pregnancy. It is very unfortunate that we do not know the proportion of maternal self-medication outside of a doctor’s prescription, and that this is closely related to the level of education of pregnant women. The China National Bureau of Statistics reported that the maternal system management rate in 2021 was 92.9% [40], which means intensive antenatal visits during pregnancy. Therefore, we suspected that the underestimation of drug exposure might be related to over-the-counter drugs. The pregnancy cohort based on actively collected data is needed to fill the gap.

Second, although regulatory agencies support the use of real-world data, such as healthcare databases, to assess the safety of drug use during pregnancy [9, 10], we recognized that there are many challenges to conducting maternal drug safety assessments based on observational data. For example, exploring and reducing indication bias, live birth bias and residual confounding. On the one hand, we took several steps to reduce selection and measurement bias in the study design and implementation phases, such as establishing a population-based pregnancy registry database and a population-based prescription database, adopting a nationally standardized CRF to record congenital malformations, and conducting rigorous data management and data validation. On the other hand, future empirical analyses need to approach causal inference as closely as possible in the observational setting by using a variety of analytical methods, such as a target study emulation strategy and multiple robustness analyses (e.g. quantification of multiple biases, negative controls and negative outcomes).

Third, our study is based on a population from the southeast region. As the varying economic levels and disease burdens across China, the drug use patterns may not be as representative as a national study. Finally, drug prescription records do not mean actual drug use, similar with many other cohort studies looking at drug safety. However, it occurs primarily in the outpatient setting, and one can define drug exposure by prescribing a particular drug multiple times to reduce this potential bias.",1

"V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
We concluded that prescribing the exact blood-thinning course
of therapy is crucial for achieving the anticipated curative value and
further annulling adverse flow choking (biofluid/boundary layer
blockage persuaded flow choking) in the cardiovascular system (CVS).
We could conclude authoritatively herein, with the animal in vivo
studies, that flow choking occurs in the artery due to air embolism at a
critical BPR (i.e., SBP/DBP ¼ 1.892 9), which is regulated by the heat
capacity ratio of air. The cardiovascular risk due to flow choking could
be diminished by concurrently reducing the viscosity of biofluid/blood
and flow turbulence. This comprehensive review is a pointer toward

achieving relentless unchoked flow conditions in the CVS for prohibiting asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders
associated with flow choking and shock wave generation followed by
pressure overshoot causing arterial stiffness.
The unchoked flow condition can be achieved in CVS of every
subject (human being/animal) by suitably increasing the thermaltolerance-level of blood in terms of BHCR and/or by reducing the BPR
within the pathophysiological range of individual subjects through the
new drug discovery, the new companion drug with the conventional
blood thinners or proper health care management for increasing the
healthy-life span of one and all in the universe. Analytical, in silico,
in vitro, and animal in vivo studies reported herein conclusively show
the possibility of flow choking in a stenosis artery due to gas embolism.
An in vitro study shows that nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are dominant gases in fresh-blood samples of healthy humans
and Guinea-pigs at a temperature range of 37–40 C (98.6–104 F),
which increases the risk of flow choking due to gas embolism.
We concluded that the asymptomatic cardiovascular risk of the
healthy Guinea pigs is lower than the human being due to the delayed
flow choking because the thermal tolerance level of the healthy Guinea
pigs in terms of BHCR is higher than humans. The high BHCR indicates delayed gasification. This remarkable finding is a pointer toward
designing new drugs to attenuate the risk of asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and disorders through proper health care reforms. We
also concluded that for a healthy life, all subjects with high BPR inevitably have high BHCR. Briefly, this review reverberates the voice of stroke
research and bioengineering advances that have increased foundational
interdisciplinary research for creating state-of-the-art ambulatory medical devices111 on earth and in human spaceflight20,23,27 and drug delivery platforms for negating undesirable flow choking (flow/biofluid)
causing asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. The conceptual advances of biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking in CVS14–31 and its effect on the memory effects of
biomaterials/viscoelastic materials are interesting research topics for
further study. Note that biofluid flow choking and its applications in
biomedicine (i.e., nanomedicine) are facilitating new plans that have
the potential to advance our fundamental understanding of asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and disorders for effective treatment.15–29,111–118 We have concluded that at a critical blood-pressureratio (BPR), the flow choking and shock wave can occur anywhere
in the cardiovascular system (CVS) with the sudden expansion/
divergence/bifurcation/stenosis/occlusion or vasospasm regions due to
the pulsatile flow of blood/biofluid through vessels. We concluded that
frequent flow choking creates memory effects (stroke history) in the
downstream region due to the enhanced wall stiffness because of
pressure-overshoot. In brevity, we can negate the risk of biofluid/
boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking by enhancing the
BHCR and/or by reducing the BPR (SBP/DBP). This review
illuminates light on discerning the possibilities of the undesirable
biofluid flow choking and stream tube flow choking in the CVS for
invoking tangible defensive plans of flow choking.14–29 We concluded
that any biofluid flow solver with a fluid structural interactive (FSI)-
model verified and calibrated at the conditions prescribed by the
boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking could precisely
forecast the existence of any flow choking phenomenon in CVS. Note
that flow choking occurs because of several determinants controlling
the critical blood pressure ratio (BPR) and biofluid/blood heat capacity
ratio (BHCR). To enhance the predictive capability of the biofluid flow
solver for solving numerous fluid dynamics problems of topical
interest,14 it is essential to invoke the thermoviscoelastic properties of
materials and the rheology of fluid in the FSI model. An accurate
estimation of the local viscosity of biofluid/blood is a challenging task
for predicting the cardiovascular risk due to flow choking. This farreaching review article is a pointer toward predicting asymptomatic
cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders due to the
undesirable flow choking at the high blood pressure ratio.11",1

"6. Conclusion
Considered together, the studies reviewed suggest that MBIs are a
promising avenue for encouraging adaptive physiological responses. In
particular, the diurnal cortisol slopes, HRV coherence, SNS activity and
some indicators of immunity differed pre-post intervention. Our review
indicates that mindfulness may act on discrete physiological systems
differently with the preliminary evidence suggesting that the HPA axis
in particular, is more consistently influenced than the cardiovascular,
and SNS systems, and potentially this can be explained by the hypotheses proposed by the integrated specificity model. It is also important to note that the baseline health status of participants can also
influence the findings as those within the normal healthy range of a
particular indicator are less likely to see improvements. The integrated
specificity model [36] suggests that changes in perceived stress impact
emotional states and that it is the emotional state rather than the stress
per se that influences changes in physiological reactivity. In line with
this, considering the role of emotions in future research may provide
valuable insight into how MBIs influence indices of stress physiology.",1

"Conclusions
Our algorithm may serve as a nonclinical marker for PD hypomimia and on and off motor states. Unlike the lengthy physical examination techniques required for the clinical assessment of PD, which require in-person or video examinations that must be rated by a trained clinician, the present automated technique is capable of rating videos of a patient’s face. This technique has the potential to improve the ability to continuously monitor the on and off states, even in the patient’s home. This can thereby serve as a serial data point for use in at-home monitoring for PD or at-home assessment in a PD clinical research study, with little patient burden and minimal technological requirements.

With a shift toward a greater role of telemedicine, an automated assessment of hypomimia could serve as a screening tool for parkinsonism and as a nonobtrusive objective score to assess on and off states. Further study will be needed to assess the value of this automated assessment in various clinical settings. The proposed model was tested on PD hypomimia, but in theory, it could be applied to other neurological conditions that produce other face signatures.",1

"5. Conclusions
Most studies reported positive outcomes for probiotics regarding the symptoms of GERD. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the outcomes and symptoms. Thus, although the results are encouraging, it is difficult to draw any general conclusions on the effects of probiotics. The heterogeneity in endpoints also made it impossible to quantitively evaluate the results. Further, the quality of the studies is concerning—only 5 of 14 studies were good quality. Nevertheless, despite the diversity in the studied product formats, populations, and experimental designs, the efficacy of the probiotic treatment does not appear to be influenced by the study quality.
Properly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with a sufficient number of participants and well-defined endpoints are needed. Studies with a longer duration should also be considered, with an intermediate analysis of the endpoints—for example, through questionnaires—to determine the period in which the benefits can be expected and whether they are long-lasting.",1

"Conclusions
In brief, the present study found that RRM2 is one target gene of miR-17-5p in A549 cells. It demonstrated that miR-17-5/RRM2 changed the cell cycle and cell tolerance to gemcitabine by affecting the expression level of CCNE1, CCNA2, and P21. This change is related to altering the p-PTEN expression level through miR-17-5/RRM2, which affects PI3K/AKT signal pathway and finally affects various effects downstream of AKT. We can change the drug resistance of A549 cells to gemcitabine by changing the expression level of miR-17-5p/RRM2, which provides an experimental basis and points out the research direction for overcoming the drug resistance of lung cancer. However, whether the miR-17-5/RRM2 axis and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway affect the cell cycle involving the MAPK/Ras signaling pathway needs to be experimentally verified.",1

In this paper, we used the siRNA to silence RAGE expression by injection of the lentivirus into SN for the first time. By RAGE ablation, NF-κB translocation to nuclear was decreased, accompanied by downregulation of COX2 expression, one of the proinflammatory cytokines. Our study has implications for the pathogenesis of PD and indicates that delivery of RAGE inhibition may represent new appealing approaches for therapy.",1

"IV. CONCLUSION
In the present work, the structural and electrical transport properties of SVO/BVO at high pressures have been
studied with Raman spectra and AC impedance spectra. A
pressure-induced structural phase transition in SVO is
observed at 3.9 GPa, and the same phase transition happens
in BVO at 4.3 GPa. Our Raman experimental results indicate
that PIA of SVO/BVO is found to occur at 10.1 and 9.3 GPa,
respectively. The transformation of PIA is involved with the
tetrahedral VO4 chains breaking up abruptly at the transition
pressure. After releasing the pressure, the amorphous structure does not have enough energy to rearrange itself into a
crystalline structure and instead it remains the amorphous
phase. However, by given enough thermal energy, these
amorphous phases of SVO/BVO can revert to their ambient
phases after heating the reclaimed samples at 623 K.
Meanwhile, the structural phase transition and PIA of BVO
are also observed to be accompanied by the sudden changes
of its resistance at high pressures. These results should be
helpful for better understanding of the physical properties in
this type of materials",1

"Conclusion:The circadian clock is universally conserved in organisms as diverse as cyanobacteria and mammals. For mammalian cells, circadian variation of the intracellular redox associated with cytosolic reactions controlled by the oscillator based on transcription translation feedback loop (TTFL) is known to re-input into the TTFL oscillator itself (Nakahata et al. 2009; Ramsey et al. 2009; Rutter et al. 2001). It is hypothesized that the cyclic signal transduction between the redox oscillation and nucleus one makes the circadian clock system be highly robust. Although such a cyclic interaction has not been reported in cyanobacterial circadian clock, notably, the amplitude of the intracellular redox was large enough to re-input into the clock system, as shown in the present work. Further research aimed at clarifying the existence and the function of the crosstalk between the intracellular redox and the circadian clock system will deepen our understanding of the physiology of photosynthetic organisms.",1
"Conclusions
Pain is a critical vital sign of a patient's overall profile. The most reliable marker of pain is to self-report. In routine assessment, providers need to better define the range of 0-10 so that patient self-reports are accurate. This can only be done via an algorithm of specific pain intensities associated with loss of functions. The FPS fits this requirement by offering adequate descriptions of the ability to function with each pain score. This study of orthopedic patients shows that the FPS has convergent validity with the other pain scales (NPS and FACEs). More research is indeed needed to gain traction for FPS, but through this small study, clinical practices are now aware of a new assessment that better approaches the quantification of pain and better direction for treatment.",1
"5. Conclusions
A new friction reduction technology, called “earthworm-like drilling”, is proposed in this paper. Compared with single-point vibration drilling, earthworm-like drilling can improve friction reduction and load transfer effect to a greater extent. Compared with multi-point simultaneous vibration drilling, earthworm-like drilling just needs to consume energy of one hydraulic pulse generator, which makes it more feasibility on site. In order to verify its feasibility and advantages, a mathematical model based on “soft-string” model is established, and a finite difference method with second-order precision is used to solve the model. The comparison results of three vibration manners indicate that more stick-slip and load transfer issue are caused by higher friction, which can be alleviated obviously under vibrating conditions. The multi-point vibration drilling is more effective than single-point vibration drilling under the same conditions. Compared with multi-point simultaneous vibration, the drop off of friction reduction effect of earthworm-like drilling due to pulse pressure attenuation can be offset by adding number of axial oscillators. Amplitude and frequency of pulse pressure and the installation positions of axial oscillators have great impact on the effect of friction reduction and load transfer. Frequency also affects the attenuation and propagation distance of pulse pressure aroused by hydraulic pulse generator. Besides, an optimizing model based on projection gradient method is established and used to optimize the positions of three axial oscillators in a three-dimensional horizontal well. The WOB increases significantly after the optimized position. The new positions of axial oscillators move towards bottom of well and close to each other.
This paper discussed the feasibility, advantages and influence factors of earthworm-like drilling, which make us realize the earthworm-like drilling is a technology with a wide range of applications. Some simplification and issues should be considered in future research, such as
(a)
The soft-string model is adopted in the mathematical model. For wells with smaller curvature, it can meet the accuracy requirement in site. Large deviation will be caused in high curvature interval.
(b)
In the actual drilling process, the drill-string includes joints and centralizers, and borehole wall is not smooth or isodiametric, and the clearance between drill-string and borehole wall can not be ignored. These conditions are bound to influence the friction reduction and load transfer of earthworm-like drilling. Therefore, the actual conditions should be considered in the future research.
(c)
Vibration is seen as arch-criminal of drill-string fatigue damage all the time, especially axial vibration. However, everything has two sides. Rational utilization of drill-string vibration can solve many problems in drilling engineering. Therefore, the safety analysis of drill-string, as a crucial component of earthworm-like drilling technology, should be fully considered in the future research.",1
"ur findings suggest that, if this hypothesis is true and astrocytes do indeed play a role in controlling neurotransmission in the NTS or the adaptive events related to CIH exposure, then these effects are not tonic, i.e. they do not depend on continuous glial activity. This differs from the conclusions of recent findings by Panatier et al. (2011), which suggest that astrocytes are continuously regulating synaptic function and neuronal activity in CNS synapses. However, it is still possible that astrocytes might play major roles in the long-term regulation of NTS neuronal activity, as even sporadic and acute glial activation can produce structural and functional changes in central synapses (Gordon et al., 2009). Additional investigations will be needed to elucidate the role of NTS astrocytes in long-term homeostatic control.
While we have here contributed to the current understanding of neuron–glia interactions in the NTS by ruling out the role of NTS glial cells in acute baseline respiratory and sympathetic control, further studies are required for a complete evaluation of how these cells might affect neurotransmission in brainstem pathways that regulate cardio-respiratory function. Currently, the capability of investigators to evaluate neuron–glia interactions is heavily restricted by methodological constraints, especially in more integrative experimental models (Fonnum et al., 1997, Hamilton and Attwell, 2010, Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006). In face of our results, new investigations on the role of NTS glia in cardio-respiratory regulation should focus on chronic neuroplastic events, as these seem most likely to be affected by neuron–glia interactions.",1

Conclusions
Proxalutamide avoided the progression of the disease in patients at later and more severe states of COVID-19, leading to a remarkable reduction in mortality rate, particularly in patients that required oxygen (scores 5 and 6 of the WHO COVID-19 Ordinary Score). The level of efficacy was similar between the North and South arms for different outcomes, which reinforces the consistency of the findings. Whether the level of efficacy of proxalutamide for hospitalized COVID-19 patients will remain in other SARS-CoV-2 variants is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the only study amongst studies that demonstrated an inter-region external validation within the same RCT.",1

"6. Conclusion and future research
This paper studies the ELN design problem in response to epidemics. A robust ELN design model is presented to periodically deploy the emergency facilities and allocate the emergency resources while minimizing the transportation cost and penalty cost caused by unmet demand.

This research pointed out the value of the proposed Demand prediction-Network design-Decision adjustment emergency logistics network design framework. First, we improve the traditional SEIRD epidemic model by fitting its parameters periodically based on the updated data and predicting the near-term trend of the epidemic. The results show that the value of RSME for short-term prediction is significantly smaller than that of long-term prediction, which can inform the decision-makers in the judgment of the epidemic situation and guide them in making decisions. Second, considering the uncertainty of the estimated demands, the proposed multi-period robust ELN design model can make emergency facility location and resource allocation dynamically. The results show that compared with the static deterministic model, it can reduce the operating cost significantly. Third, a customized rolling horizon method is proposed to iteratively solve a series of linked cycle-based problems. We improve the optimization model by allowing the uncertainty budget to be adjusted based on feedback from the actual situation and incorporated into the iterative steps of the algorithm. The results show that this solution method can significantly shorten the solution time and reduce the cumulative decision error caused by the fixed uncertainty budget. Moreover, the results of the case study illustrate the benefit of increasing the data volume for predicting the trajectory of the epidemic. The capacity of emergency facilities and material supply capacity should be considered together to improve the effectiveness of the ELN.

In summary, the proposed ELN design framework can improve the operational efficiency of the ELN and the utilization of limited emergency supplies. The DND decision framework is derived from reality and can be applied in practice and provide references for decision-makers. It can also be extended to other problems that suffer from dynamic uncertainties, such as hurricane disasters, the operation of the power system, etc.

In terms of future research, we can pay more attention to cross-regional transmission with different transition rates when building the model. As for epidemic prevention and control, the influence of the disruption of human behavior on decision-making, and the impact of real-time tracking of population infection status for accurate countermeasures should also be taken into consideration.

"At last but not the least, given the challenges of performing large-scale experimental validation on predicted miRNA–mRNA interactions, especially in a dynamic and conditional manner, and the unavailable quality benchmark data for tool evaluation, it poses significant challenges to the users. Apart from a clear need for dedicated efforts on this issue, a general understanding of the properties and rationales, strength and weakness of each class of methodologies is expected in order to make right selection of the analysis.

Immune dysregulation in COVID-19 is marked by increased inflammatory biomarkers such as N/L ratio, CRP, LDH, IL6 and Ferritin. Vitamin D is a potential immunomodulator and its adjunctive role in the treatment of COVID-19 is established by this study. Improvement of serum vit.D level to 80-100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers without any side effects.

In this cohort study, infants exposed to antenatal MgSO4 showed potentially enhanced brain connectivity reflected in stronger voxelwise functional connectivity, segregation, and integration on fMRI at term-equivalent age.

Future studies exploring the association between these MRI findings and neurodevelopmental outcomes will assist with their interpretation.",1
"Conclusion
Moving beyond previous evidence of an association between IWB and emotional eating in bariatric surgery patients, our findings in individuals seeking bariatric surgery suggest that this association may be partially facilitated through internalized shame and interrupted through greater self-compassion. Furthermore, these associations persist after controlling for the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACE), a common contributor to poor eating behaviors, as well as depressive symptoms in a subset of participants. Given implications of emotional eating for post-operative grazing, surgical complications secondary to dietary non-compliance, and weight regain, continued research utilizing longitudinal designs is warranted to better understand the role of IWB, internalized shame, and self-compassion in relation to these sequelae.

While our findings implicate self-compassion as a protective factor and/or intervention target that may disrupt the effects of IWB and shame, research is needed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of self-compassion-based training programs in this population. Additionally, given the strong direct effect of IWB on emotional eating in our sample of bariatric surgery-seeking patients after accounting for shame and self-compassion, continued research on other potential risk/protective factors remains an important focus. Moreover, individually focused interventions need to be accompanied by structural- and interpersonal-level efforts to reduce weight-based prejudice towards persons with overweight and obesity, the source of IWB, and related sequelae.",1

"Conclusions
The present study performed on nearly three hundred university students showed that CMV
infection is associated with higher intelligence measured with The Intelligence Structure Test I-S-T
2000 R. The increased cognitive performance of infected students is probably caused by the increased
probability of infection with CMV in more intelligent people, who have more social and sexual
contacts. The positive correlation between four components of intelligence and the concentration of
anti-CMV antibodies suggests that the cognitive performance of CMV infected subjects decreases with
time since the infection. In accordance with the Bradford-Hill 5th criterion of causality, this positive
correlation between intelligence and concentration of anti-CMV antibodies also suggests, but, of
course, does not definitively prove, that the CMV-intelligence association is the effect rather than the
cause of the CMV infection. CMV infection in both developing and developed countries is very high;
most of the world’s population is probably infected with this herpetic virus. Therefore, the total impact 
16
of CMV on human intelligence, and secondarily on all the other aspects of human life, including
quality of life and economy, may be extremely high. ",1

Our review showed that ivermectin does not have any significant effect on most outcomes such as progression to severe disease, negative RT-PCR, recovery, duration of hospitalization, time to negative RT-PCR, and viral load. It can possibly decrease mortality, however most of the supporting data are from highly biased studies. Due to the low certainty of evidence and large number of studies with high/moderate risk of bias, there is still a need for further investigation with larger sample sizes to show whether ivermectin is a choice in the setting of COVID-19 patients with more confidence. In order to maintain our results up to date, we will prepare a major update to our work if new evidence significantly affects the study findings.",1
"In brief, our data demonstrate that DUSP16 is involved in suppressing cellular senescence and promoting tumorigenesis. However, human cancers show a high degree of molecular heterogeneity. The responses to DUSP16 silencing are dramatically different among cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). Obviously, much work is still required to identify molecular subtypes of cancer cell lines that are susceptible to DUSP16 silencing, thereby enabling a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of DUSP16 silencing-induced cellular senescence. In addition, the availability of genetically engineered mouse models would be of great value in obtaining a better understanding of the physiological function and mechanism of DUSP16.",1
"5. Conclusions
Bilateral common carotid artery ligation could effectively replicate the rat model of vascular dementia. In addition, it could induce a decline in the cognitive function, learning, and memory abilities of the rats and could induce an increase in the expression of pro-apoptosis-related factors, as well as a decrease in the expression of anti-apoptosis factors and the expression of autophagy-related factors, and a significant increase in the number of positive cells. Aerobic exercise intervention could moderately regulate the autophagy process, effectively reduce the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, and protect hippocampal neural function. This process was closely related to aerobic exercise regulating the autophagy signaling pathway PI3K/Akt-mTOR, to improve hippocampal nerve apoptosis in vascular dementia rats.",1
"V. CONCLUSION
In summary, we have presented our new RPSH-DM method, which provides improved
surface hopping dynamics that take into account the effect of a reduced electron density
matrix within a single trajectory. This is done by combining RPMD and FSSH in a specific
manner as to use the spread of the ring polymer to mimic the width of the quantum nuclear
wave packet. By doing so, we show that decoherence through dephasing of different nuclear
wave packet components is captured through the construct of a reduced electronic density matrix. Applying our new method to Tully’s extended-coupling-with-reflection model
(model C), we show the ability to capture this mechanism of decoherence as opposed to
FSSH or a previous attempt for RPSH, namely RPSH-CA [44]. Since the reduced electronic
density matrix is calculated for each trajectory separately, every independent trajectory
incorporates decoherence in the hopping probabilities. This is not the case for FSSH and
RPSH-CA since here the evolution of the electronic wave function along a trajectory is based
on a single electronic state coefficient, only.
When comparing to an ensemble of FSSH trajectories initialized according to a Wigner
distribution, we see that the evolution of density matrix elements and nuclear positions
is quite similar to full-quantum dynamics, although the individual trajectories do not take
decoherence into account in their hopping decision. We attribute this finding to the fact that
the employed Tully’s model C seems rather insensitive to this effect. However, incorporating
decoherence effects on a single trajectory level may play a crucial, role in general [61].
Moreover, we find that RPSH-DM does not capture decoherence due to a reduction
25
of nuclear wave packet overlap on different PES, in contrast to methods that reset the
density matrix when the wave packet starts to separate on two surfaces [36]. By finding a
suitable way to combine these two methods, future work could incorporate this decoherence
mechanism as well in RPSH-DM. An alternative would be to spawn a ring polymer on
the second PES instead of hopping when it enters the NAC region such that the two ring
polymers can move independently of each other. This would be similar to the ab initio
multiple spawning method [62].
The computational cost of full quantum methods limits exact simulations of coupled
electronic and nuclear dynamics to rather small systems and short time scales [19–21]. The
available mixed quantum-classical dynamics methods such as FSSH lacked proper decoherence mechanisms [35, 36], which can be a critical issue for interpreting results for attosecond
science. The inclusion of decoherence via the RPSH-DM method developed in the present
work prospectively allows simulations of larger molecular systems and for longer time scales.
Such a tool can be vital in simulating ultrafast electronic processes such as charge migration
in polyatomic molecules and support the interpretation of attosecond experiments [12].",1

"The major advancement of the present study was to identify the effects of PDYN or KOR
signaling in the CeA in regulating alcohol drinking. Here we find that they do so in a sexspecific manner without affecting general taste preference or anxiety-like behavior. These
results contribute to our growing appreciation that the specific effects of KOR signaling in
different brain regions may diverge from effects seen with global manipulations. Indeed,
PDYN or KOR activation in the NAc has led to both appetitive and aversive responses based
on anatomical sub-region that was targeted (51,52). Additionally, because KOR may be
differentially expressed on different cell types within a brain region and shape output (53),
it is important to examine the effects of KOR activation in the projection-specific circuits.
For example, KOR inhibition of GABAergic projections to the BNST are mediated through
ERK1/2, whereas KOR inhibition of glutamatergic BLA inputs are mediated by p38/MAP
Kinase (26,54). These differences can then be exploited therapeutically with biased agonists
(55–57) and could then be used to shift the balance of inputs from one brain region to
another. Taken together, our findings support the continued search for KOR therapeutics to
treat AUD. Moreover, they suggest that KOR antagonism as a treatment modality may
exhibit sex differences if excessive alcohol consumption is driven via amygdala KOR
signaling.",1

"3. CONCLUSIONS
Here we successfully demonstrated a crystal engineering
strategy to achieve plastically flexible single crystals by
introducing active slip planes in the structure by carefully
placing selected noninterfering van der Waals (such as −t-Bu,
−OMe, −Me, −Cl/Br, etc.), π-stacking, and hydrogen bonding
groups, on three different classes of compounds. The key factor
for achieving the desired crystal packing with low frictional
planes, as required by the bending model, is primarily the
noninterfering and self-sorting nature of the selected functional
groups, i.e. (i) the van der Waals (vdW) groups, (ii) hydrogen
bonding groups that form 0D cyclic hydrogen bonded dimers,
and (iii) the aromatic π-stacking groups. The dispersive nature
of the vdW groups with spherical shape has favored formation
of smooth molecular planes with least attachment energy (i.e.,
active slip planes) in the structure. The vdW shape synthons act
as lubricated planes and allow molecular motions with minimal
friction between molecular sheets. These groups allow sliding
of molecules upon mechanical action while the π-stacking
interactions aid the flexibility of sheets during mechanical bending. The absence of extended rigid hydrogen bonding
networks is also a key factor for facilitating plastic flexibility in
crystals. It appears that the strong self-sorting and noninterfering nature of the three distinct types of groups
employed here is not only important for driving crystal
packing, but also probably critical for preserving the short-range
structural order and promoting coordinated molecular movements in the process of crystal bending. The three diverse series
studied here emphasize the potential of various weak vdW
interactions for achieving plastic flexibility. Further, these
unexploited weak interactions can also allow tuning the
properties of diverse types of stimuli responsive organic solids.
The well coordinated local molecular movements involved here
are comparable to the supramolecular structural changes that
generally occur in many other dynamic crystalline materials.
Hence, our first design approach potentially has broad
implications for materials chemistry. Quantification of the
mechanical properties by the nanoindentation technique on the
number of crystals studied here is planned for the future.",1
"In conclusion, FNS fixation has advantages in intraoperative surgery, prognostic efficacy, and lack of complications compared with CS fixation for femoral neck fractures.

In the two current immediate serial recall experiments, we replicated Walker and Hulme’s (1999) item

significant item valence effects, we did not obtain any Concreteness × Valence interaction, suggesting
that word concreteness and word valence independently modulate immediate serial recall performance.
How Hulme et al.’s account could accommodate these findings and whether the absence of this interactive effect could also occur in other memory paradigms should be further investigated in future studies.",1
"Conclusion
This work joins the growing number of crowdsourced replication projects combining multiple laboratories’ efforts to replicate a single study (Hagger et al., 2016; e.g., Moshontz et al., 2018; Schweinsberg et al., 2016). Multilab replications have an advantage over single-lab replications in that they can more accurately estimate effect sizes given the possibility of much larger sample sizes. We carried out this research as part of the CREP. Thus, this project also joins the growing movement of conducting replications in the classroom (see also Leighton, Legate, LePine, Anderson, & Grahe, 2018; Wagge et al., 2019). Involving students in replication projects is more than a valuable pedagogical tool; it has been shown to be a promising means of carrying out high-quality replications (Frank & Saxe, 2012; Hawkins et al., 2018). Here we have demonstrated that pedagogical replications can provide valuable evidence about the robustness of an effect that has not yet been submitted to independent replication. We believe that pedagogical replications could be implemented widely to advance psychological science.",1

The current study aims to address the challenges in diagnosing PD in clinical practice by proposing an automated approach that utilizes DaTSCAN imaging and DL to classify subjects as having PD or not. Various CNN models, including EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V2 models, three BCNN models, and a custom CNN architecture, were introduced to accomplish this task. Experimental findings revealed that the BCNN EfficientNet-B0-MobileNet-V2 (D3) model achieved the highest accuracy score of 98.47%, outperforming other developed CNN architectures and previous studies. This success can be attributed to the use of pre-trained CNN models, TL technique, and bilinear pooling method. Given the results achieved, the proposed approach has the potential to be a valuable tool for assisting physicians in PD diagnosis. In future work, various algorithms, such as parallel Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm and memetic differential evolution, will be used to tune the hyper-parameters of the proposed method, as the optimal selection of hyper-parameters was not considered in this work. Additionally, the proposed approach will be tested on different datasets with a larger number of samples and classes. Finally, an unsupervised DL model will be developed for early PD prediction within the SWEDD group.",1
"Conclusion
The ‘2C3L’ strategy with PVAI and empirical linear ablation across the
LA roof, MI, and CTI is an ablation technique with fixed protocol and
is associated with an outcome similar to that of the ‘stepwise’ approach in patients with persistent AF. Unlike the ‘stepwise’ technique,
a procedure following the ‘2C3L’ approach has pre-defined ablation
targets, objective endpoint and requires less procedure time, RF delivery, and fluoroscopy exposure. Ablation of CFAEs and pursuing AF
termination during the procedure seems not associated with incremental benefits to PVAI plus block of the LA roof, MI, and CTI lines
in patients with persistent AF.",1
"In conclusion, the present study revealed the clinical and biological significance of HHLA2 in GBC. Higher expression levels of HHLA2 were found to associate with worse clinicopathological parameters in patients with GBC and more advanced types of GBC. By contrast, HHLA2 knockdown suppressed GBC progression induced by TGF-β1 and lncRNA H19 overexpression, suggesting that HHLA2 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for GBC.",1
"conclusion:More work dedicated to understanding the decision making preferences of patients with PTSD is needed, such as investigating how patients decide they are ready to engage in treatment. A large number of individuals diagnosed with PTSD either do not engage in evidence-based treatment or drop out before completing treatment (Kehle-Forbes, Meis, Spoont, & Polusny, 2015; Mott, Mondragon, Hundt, Beason-Smith, Grady, & Teng, 2014). Decision making approaches better tailored to PTSD may help improve engagement and completion, as well as patient satisfaction with the decision making process. Given the variation in treatment preferences among people with PTSD symptoms, it is likely that decision making approaches will need to be flexible to maximize benefits.",1
"CONCLUSIONS
This investigation suggests that some childhood victims of firearm injury, notably those at
highest risk, may not be receiving needed mental health services. Although previously
healthy children had an increase in mental health services after firearm injury, it is unclear
from this study if this level of increased mental health services is adequately serving the
needs of this vulnerable population. Further investigation should better characterize the
potential gaps in mental health needs of children after firearm injury.6",1

"To conclude, the results of the present studies indicate that reasoners show an intuitive sensitivity to the utilitarian aspects of classic moral dilemmas without engaging in demanding deliberation. These findings lend credence to a hybrid dual process model of moral reasoning in which System 1 is simultaneously generating a deontological and utilitarian intuition. Taken together, the available evidence strongly suggests that the core idea of an intuitive utilitarianism needs to be incorporated in any viable dual process model of moral cognition.

"In conclusion, women with prior incontinence surgery, urethral hypomobility, and more
severe urge urinary incontinence symptoms demonstrated greater overall odds of failure 12
months after undergoing RMUS or TMUS surgery. Pad weight testing seems to be a
powerful predictor of failure. Although surgical history and urethral mobility are not
modifiable risk factors, this information will assist in counseling patients regarding the
efficacy of these procedures, help identify patients who may benefit from additional or
alternate therapies and assist in setting appropriate expectations for women with increased
odds for treatment failure.",1
"In summary, we found that the automethylation of PRMT7 occurs at R531 within the C-terminal domain. Functionally, automethylation of PRMT7 plays an important role in regulating breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, automethylation of PRMT7 enhances its interaction with transcription factor YY1, which recruits the automethylated PRMT7 to the E-cadherin promoter. This effect, in turn, mediates the transcriptional repression marker H4R3me2s, ultimately resulting in the onset of EMT, and the promotion of breast cancer metastasis. These findings may lay the foundation for further characterization of a new marker for metastatic breast carcinomas.",1

"In summary, VRK1 exhibited strong antitumor effects with certain clinical significance, providing a new theoretical basis for the pathogenesis and prognostic assessment of LUSC as well as a new strategy for molecularly targeted therapy of LUSC. However, only two cell lines were selected for this experiment, and further investigation of the mechanism of VRK1 action on LUSC requires assays on a larger range of LUSC cells. Further demonstration of the DDR effects of VRK1 downregulation is needed in controlled trials with additional types of DDR repair drugs. The current treatment methods for tumors are in urgent need of innovation, and targeted therapy as a new approach still has many shortcomings and needs more research and exploration.

"CONCLUSIONS
Tramadol is effective for inhibiting apomorphine induced detrusor overactivity in conscious rats. This finding makes it of interest to test the effects of the drug in lower urinary tract disorders, in which dopamine receptor activation may be involved, for example in patients with Parkinson’s disease and stroke.",1
"Cannabinoids produce their biological effects by acting through at least three receptors. The cannabinoid receptor CB1 is responsible for psychoactivity and is expressed predominately in the brain and retinal neurons.51,52 Receptor CB2 is expressed predominately in immune cells, cerebral microglial cells, and in the retina.53,54 The third receptor, abnormal-cannabidiol (abn-CBD)-sensitive receptor, is not cloned but is pharmacologically defined in the cerebral microglial cells and endothelial cells in mice lacking receptors CB1 and CB2.53,55 CBD has very low affinity to either CB1 or CB2 but is a partial agonist of abn-CBD-sensitive receptor.55 The anti-inflammatory effects of CBD may be attributable to its activity on the abn-CBD-sensitive receptor.25,26,53 The neuroprotective effect of CBD may depend on its antioxidant ability directly to scavenge ROS22,23 or indirectly to inhibit reuptake/degradation of endogenous cannabinoids, including arachidonoyl-ethanolamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. These endogenous cannabinoids act presynaptically to activate CB1, which inhibits N-type calcium channels and so further reduces calcium influx and glutamate release.56 CBD has been shown to inhibit the reuptake and degradation of arachidonoyl-ethanolamide in vitro and is a candidate for an anti-ischemia drug.56 Because the release of arachidonoyl-ethanolamide or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol occurs only in damaged regions and does not produce psychotropic effects, compounds that inhibit their transport/degradation may be of therapeutic utility without producing psychotropic effects. Current efforts are in progress to study the role of CB1 receptor by following the effects of CBD in CB1 receptor knockout mice. The nonpsychotropic CBD is a promising candidate for anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective therapeutics.",1
"Despite such limitations, we believe that the real-time assessment of epidemic dynamics with (age-specific) estimates of vaccine efficacy based on readily available surveillance datasets would be the huge advantage for epidemiological monitoring of measles in any vaccination population. As was seen in age-dependent vaccine efficacy, the proposed method could inform useful vaccination policy to objectively curb the measles epidemic in real-time. If measles vaccination is compulsory, the finding will directly lead to deciding the host for revaccination, and if voluntary, the self- and group-interests may have to be balanced 29-31. At the very least, we believe that the proposed approach can supplement the existing evaluation methods of vaccine efficacy.",1

"Conclusions: The three reviewed studies differed substantially in their methods, settings and outcomes. Each of them
found benefits from the administration of vitamin C; either against asthma attacks or against bronchial hypersensitivity,
the latter of which is a characteristic of asthma. Given the evidence suggesting that vitamin C alleviates common cold
symptoms and the findings of this systematic review, it may be reasonable for asthmatic patients to test vitamin C on
an individual basis, if they have exacerbations of asthma caused by respiratory infections. More research on the role of
vitamin C on common cold-induced asthma is needed.",1
"In summary, we propose that P. aeruginosa utilizes compound
4 as an interference strategy to preclude encroachment by
competing bacteria. In essence, this behavior parallels other
known quorum-controlled processes in that an individual cell
cannot produce sufficient quantities of tetramic acid to affect
other bacteria; the cytotoxic properties of 4 only emerge when
a population of cells synthesizes 3-oxo-AHLs. However, the
autoinducer not only functions as a transcriptional regulator but
also serves as a bactericidal agent. Although the complexation of
critical metals such as iron may play a role in this process, further
study is required into the mechanism and scope of the observed
bactericidal activity and the potential of 4 to act as a primordial
siderophore. The compilation of our data recommends that
other autoinducers be reevaluated for the potential to perform
additional biological functions.",1
"Conclusion. Findings of improved coping strategies, larger effect sizes, and higher rates of clinical improvement in the CBT-BF+active group suggest that physical activity adds value to pain management interventions for traumatized refugees.

"We used a well-established mouse model of allergic asthma
under the situation of oral and systemic iron manipulations
to find evidence supporting our hypothesis that the marked
increase in iron intake by infants offers an explanation for the
increased prevalence of allergic diseases during the last
decades. Using inbred animals with a single genetic background, we did not observe augmented manifestations of
allergic diseases due to increased oral or systemic iron administrations. Genetic background may be an important determinant of the outcome of increased iron intake on allergic
diseases. Therefore, at this point it cannot be excluded that increased consumption of dietary iron by infants may lead to
an increased prevalence of allergic diseases, including asthma
in human populations. Hence, examining the effects of high
iron intake in different mouse strains would be an informative experiment to perform along with comprehensive
retrospective epidemiological and genetic studies on the association between increased dietary iron and the prevalence of
allergic diseases. Overall, we demonstrate that, in contrast to
our hypothesis, allergen-induced airway manifestations of
allergic asthma in the mouse can be inhibited by parenteral
iron administration.",1
"CONCLUSION
Overall, the results of this study show that mice treated
with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg_x0001_1 BW TiO2 NPs for the 90 consecutive days could result in splenic toxicity, immunological
function disrupted in the spleen of mice, which are associated with changes of inflammatory-related or apoptosisrelated cytokines. These findings provide strong evidence
that the long-term exposure to low dose TiO2 NPs can cause
chronic splenic injury of mice. Therefore, the application of
TiO2 NPs and exposure effects especially on human spleen
for long-term and low-dose treatment should be cautious.",1
"Conclusions

"In conclusion, lactylation is an all-protein posttranslational modification that exists in healthy and ill patients. H3K18la may reflect the severity of critical illness as well as the existence of infection. H3K18la correlates positively with inflammatory cytokine production.

"Conclusion
PRL and PRA are positively associated with AAA development. Hydralazine and minoxidil promote the progression of AAA in a mouse model, which might be associated with increased PRL and PRA.

"Conclusions
In the paper, we propose a controlled quantum network coding without information loss by
the employment of three-particle non-maximum entangled states on the butterfly network. In our
scheme, a third party Charlie is necessary as the controller for perfect and cross transmission of
quantum states.
Compared with previous schemes, our scheme is advantageous in several aspects. First of all,
compared with the scheme in [5], our scheme realizes perfect and cross transmission of quantum
states. Secondly, compared with the scheme in [9], non-maximum entangled states are employed
CMC, 2021, vol.69, no.3 3977
to realize controlled quantum network coding without information loss instead of maximum
ones. Specifically, our scheme avoids preparation of the Bell basis and employs single particle
bases to measure particles, which is easier for practical applications. Thirdly, compared with
the scheme in [16], we consider the probability of failed transmission with the non-maximum
entangled states employed as the quantum channel. When the auxiliary particles are measured to
be |1, we avoid the re-preparation of quantum states and invalid information transmission on
the butterfly network, which improve the utilization efficiency of the channels. Finally, we give
an implementation of our scheme on the quantum circuit, which is of great reference value for
future studies.
As for the future prospects, we hope that our scheme can be applied in practice. Moreover,
this scheme could be extended to a quantum k-pair butterfly network to achieve perfect, cross
and controlled transmission of k quantum states with further researches. We also hope that our
work can contribute to the development of quantum communication [36–41].",1

"Conclusion
This is the first study to report the results of anatomy based
sentinel lymph node biopsy in actual surgeries, not in a cadaver
research. Our results suggest that axillary anatomy based sentinel
lymph node biopsy would not replace axillary lymph node
dissection, but may be considered as a method for predicting
axillary status before conducting a node dissection in cases where
sentinel lymph node could not be detected by vital dye or radioisotope injection.",1
"In conclusion, the fanning technique of FNA is superior to the standard approach as fewer
passes are required to establish a diagnosis. The results of this study suggest that further
work is needed to confirm these findings in other lesions. If these promising data are
validated by other investigators in their clinical practice, consideration should be given to
incorporating the fanning technique into routine EUS–FNA practice.",1

"In summary, the present study showed the toxic effects of TiO2 NPs on mouse primary cultured Sertoli cells by its action on viability reduction, elevated LDH release, apoptosis, excessive ROS production, and decreased antioxidant capacity, MMP reduction, and increased expression of apoptotic cytokines. Therefore, apoptosis of primary cultured Sertoli cells caused by TiO2 NPs is associated with mitochondria-mediated signal pathway and endoplasmic-reticulum-mediated signal pathway. Furthermore, NPs exposure may have potential adverse effects on spermatogenesis or fertility of animals or humans, which should be concerned when nanomaterials are widely produced and/or used.",1

"In conclusion, the hospitalization rates of AMI increased significantly in Beijing from 2007 to 2012 with a transition from STEMI to NSTEMI. In-hospital mortality and LOS decreased, whereas per-hospitalization and total in-hospital costs increased steadily. Findings from these unselected “real-world” data in Beijing may help to guide the management of AMI in China and other developing countries.",1
"Conclusions
Notwithstanding logistical challenges associated with this project, the LA Sprouts
intervention was successfully implemented in four elementary schools. Given that over half
of the participating students were overweight, an amount well above the national average,
the interest among schools and principals in having a garden-based after-school program for
obesity prevention is encouraging. Lessons learned and challenges presented here should be
considered when implementing future school-based nutrition programs, especially those
with hands-on cooking and gardening activities.",1
"In the present study, no patients experienced incision abscess,
indicating that infections were rare; additionally, no patients required
a blood transfusion. It is also important to highlight that, in the
experience of the authors, when patients remain sexually active, neither
severe shrinkage/stenosis of the graft nor discomfort with vaginal intercourse occur. For patients who are not satisfied with the results of the
procedure, it is suggested that attempts to use dilators are performed
before considering further surgeries.
The present study had some limitations. Owing to the number of
patients treated with the Luohu-one technique being smaller than the
number who received treatment with the Luohu-two technique,
caution must be used in interpreting the data. Patients' ages varied considerably and it will be necessary in the future to analyze any differences
in surgical outcomes related to age. Nevertheless, the present study
provided useful data for the treatment of patients with congenital vaginal atresia and it is concluded that laparoscopy-assisted peritoneal
vaginoplasty is a safe and effective procedure for treating these patients",1
"CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this study suggested that 6 weeks
supplementation of P. minus (LineMinus™) had
significantly improved mood specifically in tension,
depression, anger and total mood disturbance. Similarly,
the same trend was found for quality of life components
including energy/fatigue, social functioning and general
health. On the other hand, improvements in cognitive
functions were observed in both intervention and control
group. Further investigations in determining the effect
of P. minus at cellular and molecular level are strongly
recommended.",1
"Conclusion
The results of our study have demonstrated that SM significantly prevents renal I/R injury-induced renal tubular changes in the rat. SM, in 50 mg/kg, was observed to be sufficient to significantly prevent renal tubular necrosis. To our literature knowledge, this is the first specific study to demonstrate the preventive effect of SM in the renal I/R injury. The clinical implications of these results merit that further experimental and clinical studies be performed.

"Summary and conclusion
We have performed an extensive review of the literature to produce 30 recommendations and highlighted the limited evidence for many of these. We have also proposed a pragmatic algorithm for the diagnosis, characterisation and management of severe dysmotility (Figure 1 and Table 2). We have shown that there are overlapping classification models for severe dysmotility, which often sidestep aetiology. It is unfortunately rarely possible to alter underlying disease trajectory. Consequently, prognosis may be poor. Nonetheless, an optimal multi-disciplinary approach and judicious use of drugs and invasive interventions in a specialist care setting can improve outcomes.",1
"Conclusion
The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between nutrition knowledge and health
literacy as they predict HCT readiness. Nutrition knowledge represents an important point of
intervention that can enhance HCT preparation, particularly in skills to communicate with providers. Furthermore, health literacy is an important modifiable factor in young patients and can
help improve HCT readiness in pediatric, young adult, and adolescent patients studied in this
research. Our study found health literacy to be relevant in young adults’ outcomes and nutrition
knowledge to be important in both age groups. These are important areas for intervention in patient
education and HCT preparation.",1
"Conclusion
Effective, on-demand relief from postprandial symptoms, and those caused by nonacidic components of reflux, are ongoing unmet needs in GERD 8. This study demonstrates that Gaviscon DA is safe and effective for the short-term treatment of heartburn, regurgitation and associated dyspepsia. The dual, localized action of Gaviscon DA, addressing both acidity and reflux per se, make it an attractive therapeutic alternative to systemic medications for the treatment of patients with multiple, mild-to-moderate upper GI symptoms, particularly those occurring after meals.",1
"Conclusions
The new findings at Monte Alegreconfirm that some of the pictographs served astronomical and apparently
calendric functions. As such, they seem to be the earliest pictographs in the Americas, among the early uses of rock art
as landscape delimiters, and they constitute the earliest evidence of an archaeoastronomyobservatory currently known.
The ancient paintings also provide a glimpse at the cosmology of a late Pleistocene culture, their associative and
relational understanding of the world, and one of their strategies for adjusting to a new landscape. This was a period
of time when humanswere pioneering new habitats in the Americas. Here, near the equator, there is little seasonal
variation in daylight hours, temperature, precipitation phases, and the shedding of foliage unlike at higher
latitudes.However, the position of the sun, and the direction that it casts shadows doprovide reliable seasonal
indicators. By using rock art to track horizon sightings at severaldistinct sites, the painters show skill at complex
pattern recognition. Through studying the things they depicted sun, stars, comets we can begin to understand how
they may have utilized those occurrences to predictively organize economic and social activities around environmental
resource oscillations during the initial human occupation of the Amazon.",1
"In conclusion, the TREM-1/DAP12 along with HMGB1 is significantly increased in obese diabetics and prediabetic patients. Along with TREM1/DAP12 and its ligand HMGB1, TLRs and RAGE were also significantly increased in obese diabetics and can potentially play a significant role in obesity-induced insulin resistance (Figure 7). However, future studies are warranted to identify the role of pathogenic inflammatory cells associated with expression of TREM-1, TREM-2, DAP-12 and other molecules in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance using in vitro and in vivo model. Our findings suggest that TREM-1-induced HMGB1 ligand activation and inflammatory cell receptors (RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2) might ultimately lead to obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Figure 7.
Figure 7

Open in a new tab
Schematic representation of the Inflammation mediated TREM-1 induced insulin resistance. Fat deposition in obesity results in chronic inflammation leading to TREM-1 activation and thereby increased secretion of DAMPs. TREM-1 activation and DAMPs will further activate TLRs and RAGE leading to activation of inflammatory protein kinases and downstream signaling. Activated TLRs will further activate the TREM-1 expression, contributing to the cascade of chronic inflammation. This results in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-alpha, and decreased TREM-2 expression, leading to increased inflammation, TREM-1 expression, and obesity induced insulin resistance. Increased expression of the inflammatory protein kinases reduces results in insulin resistance. The TREM1/DAP12 along with HMGB1, TLRs and RAGE significantly increased in obese diabetics and pre-diabetic patients. Thus TREM-1/DAP12 may potentially play a significant role in obesity-induced insulin resistance.",1
"In conclusion, lower circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-223 were associated with lower eGFR in a cohort of patients with CKD at different stages. The observed link between the two miRNAs’ seric levels and mortality, cardiovascular events or renal events in CKD appears to depend on eGFR. However, this does not preclude their potential role in the pathophysiology of CKD, which will need further evaluation.",1
"In summary, two pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene have been detected in this study: c.6033_6034insGT previously described in a single Iranian woman affected with breast cancer and a novel c.4415_4418delAGAA mutation. Whether these alterations are specific for the Iranian population or for special subgroups remains to be investigated in larger studies. Interestingly, we did not detect a disease causing mutation in BRCA1. Penetrance or prevalence of BRCA1 mutations may be lower in Iran (Liede and Narod 2002). Whether the remaining eight investigated high risk breast cancer families carry disease causing mutations in unknown breast cancer susceptibility genes or in rare modifier genes is still unclear. Investigation of the influence of additional environmental factors in connection with genetic variants such as polymorphisms or special haplotypes are therefore necessary.",1
"In conclusion we have shown that in peripheral blood of RA
patients, the postrituximab BCR repertoire is mainly composed
of fewer but more dominant and more mutated BCR clones. In
the synovial tissue, changes in BCR clonality are observed at
later time points compared with peripheral blood, which could
explain in part the relatively slow onset of clinical efficacy of
rituximab treatment. Patients who do not respond to rituximab
at 3 months show incomplete depletion of the baseline BCR
clonal repertoire in peripheral blood within the first month of
treatment, revealing a promising early predictive marker of clinical response",1
"In conclusion, this is the first study to show an expression
profile of increased expression of claudins 1 and 4 and
decreased expression of claudin 7 in NPC. Claudin 4 and
claudin 7 may serve as a useful biomarker for the prediction
of distant metastasis and patient survival in NPC. However,
more cases need to be studied to confirm our findings.
Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the role of
claudins 4 and 7 in the pathogenesis of NPC for the
development of effective treatment.",1
"The present study showed that NaCT is expressed exclusively in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes in the intact liver. This is not all that surprising because Na+-coupled transporters are not usually found in the canalicular membrane (10, 14). However, this finding is of functional significance in relation to the physiological role of this transporter. Citrate is present in the circulation at significant concentrations (∼150 μM). Citrate in the blood could arise from dietary sources. It is also possible that citrate is released from the cells into the blood via mediated or nonmediated processes. The transporter present in the sinusoidal membrane may facilitate the concentrative entry of citrate from the blood into hepatocytes. This may have important biological implications. Citrate plays a critical role in the hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. In addition to the citrate that is produced in the citric acid cycle and then exported out of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm via the mitochondrial citrate transporter, circulating citrate may also serve as the carbon source for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis via NaCT-mediated entry into the cytoplasm. The mitochondrial citrate transporter has been cloned (18), and this transporter is distinct from NaCT. Citrate is also an important regulator of glycolysis by serving as an allosteric inhibitor of the regulatory enzyme phosphofructokinase-1. Therefore, NaCT may play a role in the control of glycolysis and glucose metabolism in the liver as well.",1
"Between Jan 1, 2001, and Oct 31, 2018, total mortality declined by 32% in men and 31% in women with diagnosed diabetes. Death rates declined from 40·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 27·8 deaths per 1000 person-years in men and from 42·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 29·5 deaths per 1000 person-years in women with diagnosed diabetes. We found similar declines in individuals without diabetes, hence the gap in mortality between those with and without diabetes was maintained over the study period. Cause-specific death rates declined in ten of the 12 cause groups, with exceptions in dementia and liver disease, which increased in both populations. The large decline in vascular disease death rates led to a transition from vascular causes to cancers as the leading contributor to death rates in individuals with diagnosed diabetes and to the gap in death rates between those with and without diabetes.",1
"In summary, pooled data from randomized clinical trials suggest that compared with moderate
LSS patients receiving X-Stop interspinous
spacer, those implanted with Superion are
more likely to obtain higher patient satisfaction
and larger reduction in the back pain severity
after surgery. And for patients who have to
receive the implantation of interspinous spacers, the Superion device is a more reasonable
treatment option",1
"DIscussion and conclusions
This scoping review explored what is known about
the use of menstruation and fertility tracking apps.
The number of such apps is large, they are growing,
and they are increasingly popular. There is enormous
variation in the types of apps38 available, ranging from
very simple diaries through to apps that use complex,
sometimes proprietary, algorithms to determine ovulation and fertility windows. A survey of 1000 women
indicates that nearly 80% of women intend to use a
fertility tracker app in the future.35
The review has a number of limitations that may
reduce its usefulness. For example, given our resources,
it was only possible to include studies published in the
English language. Our particular search terms and
other delimiters may also have inadvertently excluded
other materials that may otherwise have been included.
The disciplinary and methodological heterogeneity of
papers means that comparing the different studies is
complex and it is challenging to apply quality assessment criteria to studies that are so varied.
This review highlighted how women are motivated
to use menstruation and fertility tracking apps for a
range of reasons but that their motivations and goals
shift over time and can overlap. Previous research
highlighted the complexities of both defining pregnancy intention and women’s experiences of reproduction.39 Existing apps do not necessarily take into
account the way in which women use such apps and
human–computer interaction researchers highlight
the importance of involving users in their design and
development.40 41 This is especially important because
the user is considered to be the single greatest ‘risk
factor’ in the accuracy of apps, and this is particularly
significant if women are seeking to prevent, or plan, a
pregnancy.37
The evidence suggests that women value apps that
are accurate and based on scientific evidence regardless of whether they are relying on the app to predict
their fertile window or not.21 There is limited research
on apps that specifically support pregnancy planning
but the evidence that does exist suggests that popular
apps which contain information on planning a pregnancy are not always accurate, which could be very
misleading for women and couples that are trying for
a baby.29
The review highlights a growing evidence base on
apps marketed to prevent pregnancy with evidence
suggesting that some apps are useful for women who
do not want to rely on hormonal methods of contraception or do not want to use condoms.16–19 31 However,
not all apps accurately predict the fertile window and
women may be using apps for pregnancy prevention
that have not been designed for this purpose.36 Given
this issue and the fact that fertility apps are used fluidly
over time, this poses the potential risk of unintended
pregnancy.
While there are many apps available for download
there is little discussion surrounding the regulation of
fertility and menstruation apps. Guidance is available
for both app developers and individuals seeking to
receive approval via the FDA42 43 for Mobile Medical
Application (MMA). The FDA have approved many
different types of MMAs for use across different health
disciplines42 43 but, as noted earlier, NaturalCycles17–19
is the only app to have been granted approval as a
contraceptive,44 45 and the DaysyView app supports the
class I medical device Daysy.31 The recently published
Joint BASHH/FSRH Standard for Online and Remote
Providers of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services
may be useful going forward.46
The limited evidence base that exists within this field
means there is considerable scope for future research.
As demonstrated across the various studies, there is
a need for further prospective independent research
free from commercial interests and risk. Consequently,
it is important that future research involve users that
reflect ethnic, cultural and geographical diversity, as
well as differences across the life course. The role of
menstruation and fertility tracker apps in developing
countries is also significantly under-researched. The
involvement of fertility specialists and other health
professionals should also be an important aspect of
future research and development in this field.DIscussion and conclusions
This scoping review explored what is known about
the use of menstruation and fertility tracking apps.
The number of such apps is large, they are growing,
and they are increasingly popular. There is enormous
variation in the types of apps38 available, ranging from
very simple diaries through to apps that use complex,
sometimes proprietary, algorithms to determine ovulation and fertility windows. A survey of 1000 women
indicates that nearly 80% of women intend to use a
fertility tracker app in the future.35
The review has a number of limitations that may
reduce its usefulness. For example, given our resources,
it was only possible to include studies published in the
English language. Our particular search terms and
other delimiters may also have inadvertently excluded
other materials that may otherwise have been included.
The disciplinary and methodological heterogeneity of
papers means that comparing the different studies is
complex and it is challenging to apply quality assessment criteria to studies that are so varied.
This review highlighted how women are motivated
to use menstruation and fertility tracking apps for a
range of reasons but that their motivations and goals
shift over time and can overlap. Previous research
highlighted the complexities of both defining pregnancy intention and women’s experiences of reproduction.39 Existing apps do not necessarily take into
account the way in which women use such apps and
human–computer interaction researchers highlight
the importance of involving users in their design and
development.40 41 This is especially important because
the user is considered to be the single greatest ‘risk
factor’ in the accuracy of apps, and this is particularly
significant if women are seeking to prevent, or plan, a
pregnancy.37
The evidence suggests that women value apps that
are accurate and based on scientific evidence regardless of whether they are relying on the app to predict
their fertile window or not.21 There is limited research
on apps that specifically support pregnancy planning
but the evidence that does exist suggests that popular
apps which contain information on planning a pregnancy are not always accurate, which could be very
misleading for women and couples that are trying for
a baby.29
The review highlights a growing evidence base on
apps marketed to prevent pregnancy with evidence
suggesting that some apps are useful for women who
do not want to rely on hormonal methods of contraception or do not want to use condoms.16–19 31 However,
not all apps accurately predict the fertile window and
women may be using apps for pregnancy prevention
that have not been designed for this purpose.36 Given
this issue and the fact that fertility apps are used fluidly
over time, this poses the potential risk of unintended
pregnancy.
While there are many apps available for download
there is little discussion surrounding the regulation of
fertility and menstruation apps. Guidance is available
for both app developers and individuals seeking to
receive approval via the FDA42 43 for Mobile Medical
Application (MMA). The FDA have approved many
different types of MMAs for use across different health
disciplines42 43 but, as noted earlier, NaturalCycles17–19
is the only app to have been granted approval as a
contraceptive,44 45 and the DaysyView app supports the
class I medical device Daysy.31 The recently published
Joint BASHH/FSRH Standard for Online and Remote
Providers of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services
may be useful going forward.46
The limited evidence base that exists within this field
means there is considerable scope for future research.
As demonstrated across the various studies, there is
a need for further prospective independent research
free from commercial interests and risk. Consequently,
it is important that future research involve users that
reflect ethnic, cultural and geographical diversity, as
well as differences across the life course. The role of
menstruation and fertility tracker apps in developing
countries is also significantly under-researched. The
involvement of fertility specialists and other health
professionals should also be an important aspect of
future research and development in this field.",1
"Overall, we deliver evidence that IA GC injections are efficient
compared to placebo at reducing pain and improving function soon
after administration (≤ 6 weeks) in people with knee OA although
the safety profile should be taken into account. These results were
no longer significant when compared to other interventions (IA HA,
NSAIDs, Physiotherapy) although a trend was observed. We trust
that the results of this meta-analysis may be beneficial to stakeholders involved in outlining guidelines for the management of
knee OA and inform decisions on shortage of products and reimbursement of different compounds to ultimately optimize the care
of the large number of people suffering with this disease.",1
"CONCLUSIONS
The GWAS of dairy cattle should adhere to analytical rigor to control for multiple testing correction, population stratification, and familial relatedness; and should also include appropriate quality controls for both genotype and phenotype data. If the study objective is gene discovery, minimizing the false-positive rate is more important than controlling the false-negative rate. A genome-wide significance threshold (nominal P-value 5 × 10−8 for GWAS) is recommended for GWAS with WGS variants. Replication studies that consider bulls and cows as independent populations should be completed and followed by meta-analysis. If the study objective is to investigate genetic architecture (e.g., to understand the extent to which epistatic or gene–environment interactions control phenotypic variation), controlling for both type-I and type-II errors is extremely important to ensure statistical robustness. If the objective is to validate candidate SNPs by constructing custom SNP arrays, the significance threshold may be relaxed and more weight can be placed on functional annotation of variants.",1
"Finally, the present study may also offer a novel explanatory angle for consolidating seemingly contradictory findings related to whether repeated exposure to adversity or collective
traumas leads to sensitization (e.g., [57–59]) or desensitization (e.g., [60–62]) to subsequent
potential traumas (see also [63]). Our findings suggest that the affective responses to specific
exposures may be critical in determining subsequent responses to similar potential threats or
traumas. This logic is consistent with psychotherapy techniques in which the evocation of
trauma-related emotional responses during therapy is a key feature of successful treatment.
Specifically, prolonged exposure therapy (PET), a common evidence-based treatment for
PTSD [64], involves repeated recall of a traumatic event over time. During treatment, clients
are encouraged to maintain a high but tolerable level of distress during repeated exposures to
the trauma narrative, in a process known as systematic desensitization. Our study suggests
similar processes might be at play when repeated media coverage about a terrorist attack or
incident of mass violence focuses less on the death and destruction caused by the attack and
more on the strength and resilience of the affected communities in the wake of such tragedies.",1

regulatory factors in the upstream of miR-125a-5p, which
will be the focus of future research.",1
"Modifiable risk factors such as poor knowledge and practices need to address immediately. This could be achieved through continuous practical promotional activities by the relevant stakeholders such as the health care provider and school. It is crucial to ensure that intended messages are delivered to increase community awareness of urinary schistosomiasis.

In this review, USC remains a neglected tropical disease that needs further improvement despite various efforts implemented globally. The disparity in the incidence of urinary schistosomiasis between developed and underdeveloped countries is salient. It highlights those necessities, such as clean and adequate water supply, hinder the reduction of urinary schistosomiasis.

Given the negative impact of urinary schistosomiasis, a holistic approach involving the stakeholders such as parents, schools, and the government is needed to control and eliminate urinary schistosomiasis. Apart from that, a multisectoral partnership involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the government is needed to ensure a clean and adequate water supply, as it has an essential role in reducing urinary schistosomiasis in the community.

Further research and development are needed, especially in underdeveloped countries. For example, a non-sewered sanitation system that uses nanomembrane technology could be helpful, especially in a limited water supply [38]. Besides that, policymakers should ensure adequate financing to build the appropriate infrastructure for the water supply.

"CONCLUSIONS
A simple design for a copolarization wideband MA
based on an asymmetric structure is proposed and
investigated using CST Microwave Studio simulations. The unit cell of the proposed structure
consists of a metallic shape created by the combination of an HMSR and ICR structure with a
ground plane separated by a dielectric layer of FR-4.
The MA design parameters were optimized based on
analysis of the equivalent circuit model. The
designed MA shows copolarization absorptivity
above 90% in a wide bandwidth from 3.95 GHz to
8.02 GHz, covering the entire C-band. The total
average absorption remains above 75% over a wide
range of angle of incidence up to 60 for both TE and
TM polarizations. The electric and surface current
distributions at three distinct absorption peaks are
analyzed to explain the absorption mechanism.
Also, the physical mechanism, confirmed by the
retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters,
is mainly contributed by magnetic resonance. In
addition, the MA presents excellent practical feasibility in terms of compact structure (unit cell
dimension of  k/6.5 and thickness of  k/11.8 at
the center frequency) and insensitivity to the angle
of incidence over a wide range. The designed MA
may find applications in C-band defense and stealth
systems that require only copolarization.",1

"Conclusion
In summary, this comprehensive bioinformatic analysis has identified numerous useful molecular targets for the future investigation of the mechanisms and selection of biomarkers for MDD. Some important biological processes and pathways, including the corticosteroid and glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathways, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the neutrophil activation involved in the immune response, as well as the hub genes working in these processes, may provide novel insights into the development and progression of MDD. Furthermore, the potential molecular mechanisms that have been identified simultaneously include innate immunity, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic factors for synapse function and development. In addition, further molecular biological experiments will be performed by our team to confirm the function of the identified genes in MDD.",1
"Conclusions
In this large, patient-level analysis of 2 pivotal trials, while
we observed overall benefit comparing sacubitril/valsartan
to RAS inhibition, these findings were driven by benefit in
patients with chronic HF and LVEF below the normal range.
In contrast, patients at the highest end of the ejection fraction range demonstrated lower overall mortality, higher
proportions of noncardiovascular death, and did not appear to benefit from sacubitril/valsartan compared with
RAS inhibition. These data suggest that the therapeutic effects of sacubitril/valsartan, compared with a RAS inhibitor
alone, vary by LVEF, with treatment benefits, particularly
for heart failure hospitalization, that appear to extend to
patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction. These therapeutic benefits appeared to extend to a
higher LVEF range in women compared with men.",1
"Conclusions
Chlorhexidine application to the cord reduces the risk of neonatal mortality and omphalitis in infants born at home in high-NMR settings. Therefore, routine chlorhexidine application, preferably daily for 7 to 10 days after birth, is recommended in these infants. There is presently insufficient evidence for recommending this intervention in infants born in health facilities and/or low-NMR settings.",1
"Conclusions
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of individuals with cardiometabolic conditions, interventions
that combined activity trackers (especially pedometers) with complementary intervention components,

"Conclusion
In summary, a strategy with a channel electrode is proposed here for artificial synaptic electronics and AI computing. In this strategy, a simplified single-channel transistor, ie, CET, was shown to realize synaptic functions with both a conventional gate and control gates connected to the channel directly. This device, under a driving voltage of no more than 2 V, could be accomplished by standard processes. This study showed that the CET employing advanced semiconductor materials emulated and opened the door for improved neuron behavior control and understanding. This CET device could be appealing for neuromorphic computation circuits as well as other bioinspired applications.",1

"Conclusions
Early use of dual antiplatelet therapy was effective in reducing the risk of early stroke recurrence and other vascular events, when compared with mono antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA. No significant excess in major bleeding was observed. Results of ongoing large trials will provide more evidence to assist health care providers in the selection between dual and mono antiplatelet therapies for acute IS or TIA. Based on the current data, early use of dual antiplatelet therapy after acute noncardioembolic IS or TIA for a limited time period appears to be efficacious and safe.",1

"Detection of DNA in oropharyngeal swabs or blood is not the same as detection of viable organisms. However, the observation that T. pallidum DNA is not detected beyond 5 days after initiation of treatment suggests that detection of T. pallidum DNA in these samples represents recent infection, which is the potential advantage of nucleic acid amplification over serological tests. In our study, testing both oropharyngeal swabs and blood increased the proportion of positive individuals from 27% to 41%. From a clinical standpoint, DNA testing would be most useful when positive, particularly when there is no physical examination evidence of syphilis, because it would confirm the diagnosis. Future prospective investigation is required to determine the utility and cost-effectiveness of detection of T. pallidum DNA in conjunction with serological tests for syphilis diagnosis, particularly in individuals with asymptomatic syphilis.",1

"In conclusion, this study revealed that altered sleep pattern has a robust effect on periodontitis and that this influence exceeds the effect of short sleep. The major limitation of this study is that the information on sleep patterns was inferred indirectly from the work pattern. However, this inference also strengthens our study because the variable “shift work” implies that the sleep cycle is forcibly modified against one's will or chronotype, and this corresponds well to the definition of circadian disruption focused on here. In addition, factors including the cross-sectional design of the study, possible underestimation of the periodontal status due to partial periodontal assessment protocol of the CPI surveillance system, and the use of self-recorded questionnaire to measure some of the exposures may weaken the strength of our result. Therefore, further longitudinal studies with more detailed data are required to confirm the correlation that are found and to elucidate the causal relationship between the two entities, that is, altered sleep pattern and periodontal disease.",1

"In summary, we observed age-specific associations between measures of adiposity and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. There was a greater burden of morbidity in our population than would be expected in the general population which may limit the generalizability.

"In conclusion, among patients with anemia of CKD on dialysis, treatment with oral roxadustat increased Hb as effectively as epoetin alfa, with reduced IV iron and noninferior reduction in RBC transfusion, according to the present algorithm of administration. The AE profile of roxadustat was comparable with epoetin alfa in this study; however, the roxadustat global phase 3 program was designed to assess cardiovascular safety using a pooled analysis of similarly designed trials, including ROCKIES. Overall, the findings of the ROCKIES study suggest that treatment protocols with roxadustat may be an acceptable option for the treatment of anemia of CKD in patients on dialysis.",1

"Conclusions
Proxalutamide avoided the progression of the disease in patients at later and more severe states of COVID19, leading to a remarkable reduction in mortality rate, particularly in patients that required oxygen (scores

Fire and summer play a role in determining germination of studied Cistaceae, which supports the general idea that in many cases physical seed dormancy has allowed plant survival under hard and stochastic environments (Hudson et al. 2015). Fire was the main factor breaking physical dormancy, contrary to summer temperatures, which had a negative effect on seed germination. Therefore, the timing of heat shock, before or after high summer temperatures, determined seed germination in most species, and consequently, implications for fire management can be extracted.",1

In summary, we have firstly demonstrated that RvD1 could
ameliorate IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation effectively, as evidenced by decreased PASI scores, epidermal thickness,
number of inflammatory cells in dermis and relevant cytokines of
the IL-23/IL-17 axis. We have also discovered that RvD1 inhibits
MAPKs and NF-kB signaling pathways, which mediate IMQinduced inflammatory responses. Further, the beneficial effects of
RvD1 appear to be mediated through ALX/FPR2 receptor.
Therefore, the powerful anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving
effects of RvD1 observed here, suggest that RvD1 could be used
as a novel anti-psoriasis drug.",1
"The current study highlights the need for more widespread
assistance for families at risk of being food insecure. Having

"To summarize, based on multivariate analyses of lesion location and indirect measures of disconnection, our results extend a previous study with this data set and partly confirm similar recent studies on the role of lesion locations in PSDS. Specifically, we identified an association of lesions in the right insular cortex, right putamen and inferior frontal gyrus with PSDS. Furthermore, structural disconnection in the white matter of the right temporal lobe was associated with PSDS, but there was no evidence for a contribution of functional diaschisis to PSDS. These analyses show the potential of indirect measures of disconnection and diaschisis for structure–function inference. Still, even larger cohorts, which include patients with aphasia and a more detailed behavioral characterization, are needed to leverage the full potential of LNSM and SDSM for our understanding of PSDS.",1

"Conclusion
Collectively, this study manifests that ZFAS1 and
FGF7 expression is enriched, while the miR-144-
5p level is decreased in MCAO rats. ZFAS1 aggravates the neurological dysfunction and tube formation ability in FCI rats via sponging miR-144-
5p to target FGF7. The current discovery makes
a contribution to introducing novel therapy targets for FCI by highlighting the importance of
ZFAS1/miR-144-5p/FGF7 axis. However, as for
clinical practice, there were still many obstacles
that remained to be addressed. Affected by the
complicated regulatory mechanism of ZFAS1/
miR-144-5p/FGF7 axis and the poor practice
experiences, how to apply this approach to the
FCI treatment in an effective and quantitative
way to optimally minimize side effects still

such limitation would be a key study point in
our future works.",1
"In conclusion, we found a significant difference in the effect of vitamin C on mild vs. severe outcomes of the common cold. Vitamin C substantially decreased the severity of colds without influencing their overall duration. Given the low cost and safety of vitamin C, the 15–26% decrease in cold severity may justify regular vitamin C administration in some contexts, such as for people who have frequent contact with young children. Further research should be carried out to estimate the effect of therapeutic vitamin C which is started immediately after the onset of early common cold symptoms. In future studies, various outcome definitions should be considered to enable a more detailed understanding of the effects of vitamin C.",1
"In conclusion, our data indicated that Sox3 expression is enhanced in HCC tumor tissues compared to the non-tumor counterparts. Furthermore, the most significant finding of the study is that Sox3 is a novel and potential biomarker for predicting the poorer prognosis of HCC patients after surgery.

"Our findings are consistent with available human data suggesting that initiation of ART after M. tuberculosis/HIV coinfection may not prevent reactivation of LTBI in all individuals (48, 49). It is, however, conceivable that coupling ART with either isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or isoniazid plus rifapentine 3-month therapy (3HP) may completely or substantially prevent TB reactivation. In this regard, it is important to note that we have developed a model for LTBI treatment in macaques using 3HP (18). Furthermore, as novel treatment regimens for LTBI with greater efficacy are developed, our model could serve as the key resource to validate them. As such, our results have the potential to inform treatment approaches for the syndemic resulting from the 2 most important infectious diseases of humanity.",1
"4. Conclusions
We produced pure 3D porous Ti3C2Tx and 3D porous Ti3C2Tx-NiO composite electrodes with different initial weight ratios by freeze-drying method. As per the absorption experiments in water and oil, the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx had a remarkable and comparable absorption capacity. The electrochemical performance of pure 3D porous Ti3C2Tx and 3D porous Ti3C2Tx-NiO composite electrodes was studied in the scan rate range of 2–100 mV/s using 1 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. The composite electrodes effectively combined the advantages of Ti3C2Tx and nickel oxide. The addition of nickel oxide improved the specific capacitance of the composite electrode and the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx framework ensured relatively good cyclic stability of the composite electrodes. The volumetric specific capacitance of the electrode was maximum for the initial weight ratio of 1:1 for Ti3C2Tx-NiO. Adding NiO was an effective way to improve the specific capacitance of 3D MXene. The capacitance retention of the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx-NiO composite electrodes was superior to the analogous materials reported in several literatures.",1

These data provide new ideas for the development of biomarkers and targeted therapy for NPC.

"Conclusions
We found that CNDDD is more likely to happen at the seedling stage than at the seed stage. There is strong evidence that fungal pathogens are key drivers in causing conspecific negative distance dependent mortality, but there have been too few studies so far to rule out a role for specialist insects. Different sizes of mammals had opposite effects on CNDDD at the seed stage; small mammals could be a cause of CNDDD, but large mammals may overwhelm this effect. More manipulative experiments considering multiple natural enemy types combined and separately should be conducted in the future to reveal the mechanisms behind CNDDD and make predictions for the effects of global change.

its cooperative stage does not show consistent personalities or

"4. Discussion and conclusion
The GPR12-Gs complex structure we report here reveals key features of GPR12 that contribute to its high constitutive activity. In the extracellular region, ECL2 packs into the transmembrane core and partially overlaps with the putative orthosteric pocket, also forming close contacts with ECL3. Together with the tight connection between TM1 and TM7, the receptor is stabilized at a more active conformation. Also, the unique P7.41 from TM7 may aid the movement and rotation of TM6 and TM7 during GPR12 activation. The lack of canonical structural microswitches or motifs that modulate ligand-dependent conformational changes in most class A GPCRs may contribute to the high constitutive activity of GPR12, which is also observed in other GPCRs like BILF1 [53]. The structural similarities and differences between GPR12 and closely related cannabinoid receptors and other lipid receptors provide clues for the putative binding pocket in the receptor and facilitate the potential endogenous ligands screening.
The naturally occurring mutations that increase or decrease the constitutive activity of GPCRs have been discovered in several receptors, and these GPCR mutations can cause many diseases [54]. For example, the loss of constitutive activity in the mutant melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is known to be one cause of obesity [55]. Interestingly, the naturally occurring point mutations are also observed in GPR12, which result in the down-regulation of the constitutive activation of the receptor. These mutant GPR12 are highly correlated with breast, head and neck, kidney, and esophageal cancers (BioMuta curated single-nucleotide variation and disease association database) [56]. For instance, some point mutations in ECL2 showed the down-regulation of the cAMP level and significantly increased the risk of cancer, such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, uterine cancer, and others [56]. Thus, the structural features and constitutive activity mechanism of GPR12 will facilitate drug design and help identify the inverse agonists/antagonists or agonists of GPR12 that modulate short-term memory disorders and may provide treatment of cancers.

"Taken together, by using loss-of-function approach, our study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence for the role of Eag1 in promoting the proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion of OS cells. Further mechanistic studies to understand the role of Eag1 in the regulation of adhesion, migration, and invasion of OS cells will help develop Eag1 siRNA as a novel therapeutic approach to treatment of OS and improve the prognosis of OS. However, we do note that this study has certain limitations. Our results showed that Eag1 siRNA can inhibit OS cells adhesion, migration, and invasion through the STAT3/VEGF pathway. However, the regulation of migration and invasion-related cytokines in OS cells is quite complex. We do not rule out the detailed mechanisms of how Eag1 regulates the STAT3-VEGF pathway or the possibility that other pathways that modulate VEGF expression may also be affected by Eag1 siRNA. Moreover, we also do not rule out the molecular relationship or molecular mechanisms between Eag1 and STAT3. Previous study has demonstrated the role of IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a feedback loop in colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis [32], and our previous study has shown the relationship between miRNA-34a and Eag1 [18]. Thus, we assume the connection between miRNA-34a, STAT3, and Eag1 and all of these will be our next aim.",1
"Implications for practice
This review provides very low‐ to low‐quality evidence that combined external beam radiotherapy and chemoembolisation may lower mortality and increase complete and overall response rates, despite an increased toxicity as expressed by a higher rise of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase, in comparison with chemoembolisation alone. The high risk of systematic error (bias) in all of the included trials, as well as the imprecision and inconsistency of the results, suggest that these findings should be considered cautiously and that high‐quality trials are needed to further assess the role of external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Implications for research
There is a need for large, high‐quality, randomised clinical trials of external beam radiotherapy for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the most relevant comparators are surgery and other non‐surgical ablation methods, especially radiofrequency ablation and percutaneous ethanol injection (Taefi 2013; Weis 2013). It is also important that the randomisation process and the interventions are clearly described. The participant flow and data handling should be well specified. The trials must be designed following the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement (spirit‐statement.org) and reported following the CONSORT statement (consort‐statement.org).

Seven ongoing randomised clinical trials are currently evaluating different techniques of external beam radiotherapy for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We expect to include their results in future updates of the present review.",1
"In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analyses revealed associations between obesity and COVID-19 comorbidities and outcomes. Obesity appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of having more severe COVID-19, developing ARDS, being hospitalized, being admitted to the ICU, and requiring IMV. However, obesity does not appear to be associated with increased mortality from COVID-19, at least in unadjusted analyses of data published during the first 6 months of the pandemic. These results have direct implications for clinicians because body mass index and obesity status are readily obtainable data that can be used to identify patients at higher risk of a more severe COVID-19 disease course.",1
"In sum, we conclude that HRV was an excellent index of autonomic tone modulation by cognitive processing in our study, with the highest effect produced by the perceptual task. In addition, the fitness level of the participants appeared to be a key factor, with an improved functioning of the cardiac autonomic control (i.e., higher HRV values) and cognitive performance (in the sustained attention task) in the high-fit group with respect to the low-fit group. Moreover, the high-fit group appeared to be less affected by the time spent performing the cognitive tasks, which can be taken again as an index of more efficient sustained attention. Future research will determinate further the links between particular cognitive processes and HRV, and the role played by physical fitness level on this relationship.",1
"To conclude, we found that tDCS over lDLPFC does not
modulate the AB as a function of baseline AB magnitude,
nor at the group level. In fact, Bayesian analyses revealed
convincing evidence that tDCS to lDLPFC did not affect
AB performance at the group level. A post hoc analysis
did show that the direction of the effect of tDCS on temporal attention varied over participants, with an inverse relationship between the effects of ctDCS and atDCS. This
pattern of results may be explained by an inverted
U-shaped relationship between prefrontal excitability and
AB magnitude but demands replication. Our results add
to a growing body of work describing null effects of tDCS
on a variety of cognitive effects (Medina & Cason, 2017;
Horvath et al., 2015a, 2015b).",1

"CONCLUSIONS
A simple design for a copolarization wideband MA
based on an asymmetric structure is proposed and
investigated using CST Microwave Studio simulations. The unit cell of the proposed structure
consists of a metallic shape created by the combination of an HMSR and ICR structure with a
ground plane separated by a dielectric layer of FR-4.
The MA design parameters were optimized based on
analysis of the equivalent circuit model. The
designed MA shows copolarization absorptivity
above 90% in a wide bandwidth from 3.95 GHz to
8.02 GHz, covering the entire C-band. The total
average absorption remains above 75% over a wide
range of angle of incidence up to 60 for both TE and
TM polarizations. The electric and surface current
distributions at three distinct absorption peaks are
analyzed to explain the absorption mechanism.
Also, the physical mechanism, confirmed by the
retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters,
is mainly contributed by magnetic resonance. In
addition, the MA presents excellent practical feasibility in terms of compact structure (unit cell
dimension of  k/6.5 and thickness of  k/11.8 at
the center frequency) and insensitivity to the angle
of incidence over a wide range. The designed MA
may find applications in C-band defense and stealth
systems that require only copolarization",1
"Conclusion
Both revisional RYGB and OAGB had comparable significant weight loss effects when performed for WR after LSG, with comparable resolution or improvement of associated medical problems. Given the advantage of being a simpler and easier procedure, OAGB may have a greater chance of being the optimal revision procedure if longer follow-up data are available. After a 2-year follow-up, both procedures were safe, with no significant differences in the occurrence of complications and nutritional deficits.",1
"In conclusion, researchers should consider using our multiple-trial paradigm (Crime–Lineup–Crime–Lineup) to obtain more data from fewer participants. Future research into multiple-trial designs should examine whether any systematic effects emerge beyond 24 trials or with any other paradigms (e.g., that of Meissner et al., 2005). Overall, a multiple-trial design for independent lineup trials can be an effective way of obtaining powerful datasets in lineup experiments, allowing researchers to examine more complex interactions than are typically tested and that could significantly contribute to our understanding of eyewitness decision making.",1
"In conclusion, we firstly sought to confirm the role of hypoxia in PASMCs and found that hypoxia
promoted the cell proliferation and cell migration in PASMCs. Second, we proved the down-regulation
of MEG3 of in PASMCs under hypoxia and repression of MEG3 promoted the hypoxia-induced cell
proliferation and cell migration of PASMCs. Then, we demonstrated that MEG3 exerts its role via
modulation of miR-21 expression in PASMCs under hypoxia. In addition, we illustrated that PTEN was
regulated by miR-21 and MEG3 and involved in the modulation of hypoxia-induced cell proliferation
and cell migration in PASMCs. Thus, we confirmed the role of hypoxia in PASMCs and the underlying
mechanisms that MEG3 involved in the regulation the hypoxia-induced cell proliferation and cell
migration in PASMCs via modulation of miR-21/ PTEN axis.",1

"Conclusion
The results from our study have shown that upregulation of miR126 in NSCLC A549 cells can lead to decreased expression of the
target gene PIK3R2 and influence the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway, suppressing the proliferation, migration, and invasive
ability of A549 cells. This could provide new insights for the
diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. However, our results should be
validated in other cell line models. Furthermore, PI3K mutations
have been associated with the acquired resistance of EGFR mutant
lung cancers against EGFR inhibitors. Thus, prospective studies
investigating whether miR-126 is involved in the resistance of lung
cancer cells harboring PI3K mutations against small molecule inhibitors of PI3K and in the resistance of cells with EGFR mutations
against EGFR inhibitors are needed.
Clinical Practice Points
_x0008_ A high level of miR-126 is found in highly vascularized tissues,
and PIK3R2 is one of the target genes of miR-126. Also, the
PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway has been recognized as a crucial
pathway governing the signaling of biologic processes such as
apoptosis, metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell growth.
_x0008_ The upregulation of miR-126 in NSCLC A549 cells reduced the
expression of the target gene PIK3R2 and influenced the PTEN/
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suppressing the proliferation,
migration, and invasive abilities of A549 cells.
_x0008_ The results of the present study might be helpful clinically to
find therapeutic strategies directed toward miR-126 function for
patients with NSCLC.",1
"Finally, the present study may also offer a novel explanatory angle for consolidating seemingly contradictory findings related to whether repeated exposure to adversity or collective traumas leads to sensitization (e.g., [57–59]) or desensitization (e.g., [60–62]) to subsequent potential traumas (see also [63]). Our findings suggest that the affective responses to specific exposures may be critical in determining subsequent responses to similar potential threats or traumas. This logic is consistent with psychotherapy techniques in which the evocation of trauma-related emotional responses during therapy is a key feature of successful treatment. Specifically, prolonged exposure therapy (PET), a common evidence-based treatment for PTSD [64], involves repeated recall of a traumatic event over time. During treatment, clients are encouraged to maintain a high but tolerable level of distress during repeated exposures to the trauma narrative, in a process known as systematic desensitization. Our study suggests similar processes might be at play when repeated media coverage about a terrorist attack or incident of mass violence focuses less on the death and destruction caused by the attack and more on the strength and resilience of the affected communities in the wake of such tragedies.",1
"In summary, we demonstrated that DCLK1 expression was up-regulated in the HCT116 spheroids under both normal and hypoxia condition. Cells from spheroids are more capable to produce progenies. Our data also indicates that DCLK1 is up-regulated in the CSCs, and this may be correlated with their stronger self-renewal capability. DCLK1 may become a novel target for colorectal cancer therapy. Further studies from patients’ specimens are needed for a continued clarification of the role of these cells in therapy response and therefore to contribute for the establishment of novel therapeutic strategies.",1

"Conclusions
Early use of dual antiplatelet therapy was effective in reducing the risk of early stroke recurrence and other vascular events, when compared with mono antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA. No
significant excess in major bleeding was observed. Results of ongoing large trials will provide more evidence to assist health care providers in the selection between dual and mono antiplatelet therapies for acute IS or TIA. Based on the current data, early use of dual antiplatelet therapy after acute noncar- dioembolic IS or TIA for a limited time period appears to be efficacious and safe.",1

"ConclusionHistorical evidence of epidemic management and contem- porary anecdotal evidence have shown the potential and possibilities of managing epidemic/pandemic diseases with homeopathy. During Spanish flu (1918), success stories were documented, whereas in the COVID-19 pandemic research- ers seek to investigate homeopathic medicines prospectively and scientifically with modern research tools. With the support of the Ministry of AYUSH, millions of people in India are being advised to take the homeopathic medicine Arsen- icum album 30C as a prevention, and Oberbaum’s challenge that, in the face of COVID-19, we might “miss the opportunity again” to obtain good scientific evidence for homeopathy,51
has been taken up by Indian homeopaths. Ten of the treat- ment studies listed in this article are being conducted in conventional settings, involving experts from orthodox med- icine, to establish efficacy or comparative effectiveness. Indian homeopathic physicians and researchers have seized
the opportunity promptly and effectively.
In this review, we found 29 clinical studies registered at the
Clinical Trial Registry—India which are aimed at the repurpos- ing of homeopathic medicines for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19. Amongst the proposed medicines, Arsenicum al- bum is the most investigated. Repurposing of medicines is a desirable strategy: it may facilitate re-discovering the poten- tial of different medicines, it might reduce costs and, when used in an integrated manner, it might reduce the time of
patients’ recovery to good health. We hope that these studies, undertaken in conventional medical settings, will generate valuable research evidence and thus help to find solutions for COVID-19 prevention or treatment through homeopathy.",1
"4. Conclusions
This study aimed to track the variations of the volatile components and rheological properties in L. helveticus fermented milk throughout the fermentation process and explore prebiotic fermented milk from a sensory perspective. The quality of the fermented milk prepared using L. helveticus as a starter tended to be stable after 24 h, with the fermentation aroma reaching its highest at 72 h and the off-flavour being the weakest at 48 h. Styrene, Linalool, Octanoic acid, and 1-Nonanol were the key flavour active substances during fermentation. The type of prebiotics affected some physicochemical and sensory properties of the fermented milk. Compared with single inulin prebiotics and GOS prebiotics, the blend addition of inulin/GOS probiotics significantly improved the texture and flavour release of fermented milk. To some extent, these results provide new insight into the dynamic changes of fermented milk during fermentation, further investigation of the Starter and prebiotics conditions on the quality and flavour of processed dairy products is warranted.",1
"Conclusions
We present a genome of the parasitoid wasp C. chilonis to understand the genetic basis of trait loss in amino acid biosynthesis and amino acid resource exploitation. Amino acid biosynthetic pathway analyses and feeding experiments indicated that C. chilonis lost the ability to synthesize ten amino acids. And the biosynthetic pathways of nine of them have been disrupted in the common ancestor of animals. Comparative genomics analyses showed that the loss of arginine synthesis is common in arthropods, including in C. chilonis. Further transcriptomic and metabolomic studies illustrated that C. chilonis inhibit amino acid utilization and activate protein degradation in the host, likely resulting in the increase of amino acid content in host hemolymph. Altogether, our discoveries lay a blueprint for future research on the mechanisms underlying the exploitation of host nutrition by parasitoid wasps, and this knowledge can specifically be used to design parasitoid artificial diets which potentially benefit mass rearing of parasitoids for pest control.",1

"In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TiPs attenu- ated the inhibitory effect of osteocyte-conditioned medium on osteoclast formation. This effect was involved in the downregula- tion of IFN-b by TiPs. Furthermore, our data suggested that autop- hagy mediated the downregulation of IFN-b in osteocytes. More importantly, blocking autophagy with siAtg5 resulted in the signif- icant amelioration of the osteoclast formation that was stimulated by TiPs-CM. In the present study, the results suggested a novel role
of autophagy in regulating wear debris-promoted osteoclastogene- sis via interactions with osteocytes. The findings indicated that osteocytes may play a key role in the progression of wear debris induced osteoclast formation and osteolysis. Our results suggested a possible mechanism underlying wear debris-induced osteolysis.",1

We call for a global ban on asbestos, especially in Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.",1
"In summary, we demonstrated that GAS5 acts as a tumor-suppressive factor in progression of human CRC, and exogenous overexpression of GAS5 inhibits tumorigenesis, at least in part regulated through the miR-34a/SIRT1 axis. miR-34a participates in regulating GAS5-suppressed CRC cell macroautophagy and induces apoptosis through the mTOR/SIRT1 pathway. GAS5-mediated regulation of macroautophagy maintains CRC cells in an equilibrium state that protects against apoptosis. GAS5/miR-34a/SIRT1/mTOR forms a negative regulatory feedback loop that provides new insight into the mechanisms of CRC progression and the influence of macroautophagy on the malignant behavior of CRC through external factors. Macroautophagy may be a potential method to screen out relevant target molecules and provide a reliable basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CRC.

We report that delayed and immediate definitive surgical treatment for cT1a RCC confers comparable long-term overall survival. The findings of this study support the fact that immediate surgery has no survival advantage even when surgery is delayed for >12 months.

"CONCLUSION
Unprofessional behavior is prevalent among surgical residents who use Facebook, and this behavior does not appear
to decrease as residents progress through training. This
represents a risk to the reputations of hospitals and
residency programs, and it is important that residents
receive education on the dangers of social media.
As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that social
media will play an increasing role in medicine. As educators,
it is our duty to understand the rate of use and the potential
dangers, as well as to create standards and curriculums, to
guide trainees through these rough waters. We also have an
obligation as disciplinarians to ensure that residents do not
cause damage to institutional reputations or, even worse, to
the privacy or dignity of our patient population. Although it
may be perceived as an invasion of the residents’ privacy,
program directors may benefit from monitoring Facebook
and other similar OSNs to identify gaps in professionalism
among surgical residents that require correction. These
OSNs may also be used to screen residency applicants for
behavior that may be a warning of future issues with
professionalism.",1
"Overall, our study showed that Cu stress inhibited the growth of O. glazioviana seedlings and increased the root Cu concentration. Our proteomic analysis identified 58 DAPs in the roots of O. glazioviana seedlings involved in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, detoxification and stress defence, development, and oxidoreduction. Using KEGG and PPI analysis, we identified 13 DAPs that were involved in different pathways. The CA cycle was the most significantly enriched, and then the citrate synthase exhibited most up-regulated among these 13 DAPs. These results suggested that CA might play a critical role in the overall plant response process to Cu. Subsequently, we applied exogenous CA to Cu treated seedlings in order to verify our assumption. We found that exogenous CA alleviated Cu stress symptoms, probably because it regulates the expression of proteins related to plant response to Cu stress. These results provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant response to Cu.",1
"5. Conclusions
In this study of a large sample size (>2.5 million term births), we found a relationship between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy and risk of term SGA and changes in birth weight, both of which are vital markers of fetal growth. We found that maternal exposure to CO during the entire pregnancy was significantly associated with lower birth weight and higher risk of term SGA, and the harmful effects of CO exposure were most pronounced during the later pregnancy. In addition, we found PM10 exposure during the first trimester increased odds of term SGA. The results suggest CO, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 could be risk factors associated with birth weight reduction of newborns in Guangdong province of China; however, the current levels of the pollutants were not the risk factor to increase the chance of LBW among term infants. Moreover, our results gave a clear indication as to which trimester could be most influential with respect to air pollution and fetal growth. In view of the ubiquity of air pollution exposures as well as the spatial heterogeneity of air pollution in China, our results have important clinical and public health implications. Further studies are warranted to integrate these findings and take effective interventions in pregnancy. And promoting environmental health policy to reduce ambient air pollutants may be beneficial for fetal growth.",1

"Conclusions
Our study suggested that Allo-HSCT provided a significant long-term survival advantage for MLL rearranged AML patients, especially in OS. In addition, whether MLL rearranged AML patients reach CR or not is an independent prognostic factor. Not reaching CR indicates a very poor prognosis. We first reported that platelet count is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. MLL rearranged AML patients with a platelet count <50×109/L before treatment had a very short OS, and very high mortality and recurrence rates. We observed that MLL rearranged AML patients with extramedullary infiltrates can easily relapse and that Allo-HSCT is superior to chemotherapy alone for treating MLL rearranged AML patients to get a better prognosis and a longer survival. The findings of this study should be valuable for providing guidance for the treatment and prognostic analysis of MLL rearranged AML patients. It has very important clinical value.",1
"Branching morphogenesis is a fundamental developmental process generating the branched
epithelia of many organs, including lungs, kidneys, and the mammary and salivary glands
(1–8). Branches are generated by local outgrowths or by formation of clefts that subdivide
epithelia into buds. Bud or tubule extension is promoted by various growth factors (9–11),
but the mechanism of cleft formation is poorly understood. One model for cleft formation
involves the local loss of epithelial cell-cell adhesions and replacement by interactions with
extracellular matrix accumulating within clefts (9, 12, 13).
The matrix protein fibronectin is required for salivary, kidney, and lung branching (13–15).
Wedges of fibronectin translocate inward as clefts form between randomly motile epithelial
cells, accompanied by loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin in cells adjacent to
the fibronectin (13, 16). How a matrix molecule can drive cleft formation and branching is
unknown. Here we identify the activity of a regulatory gene termed Btbd7 at cleft-forming
sites and provide mechanistic insight for dynamic cleft propagation in branching
morphogenesis.
We focused initially on the mouse submandibular salivary gland, a classical model for
analyzing mechanisms of branching morphogenesis (12, 17, 18). During branching, we observed local loss of the relatively columnar organization of cells in the outer layer of
salivary epithelia (19) near the bottom of advancing clefts (Fig. 1A–C and S1). Time-lapse
confocal microscopy of glands from EGFP-expressing transgenic mice suggested that
transient intercellular gaps form at this site as clefts advance, which we confirmed directly
using fluorescent dextran to document dynamic gap formation as clefts deepen (Fig. 1D and
S2).
To search for a regulatory gene that might be involved in this process, we compared genes
expressed in laser-microdissected epithelial cells from cleft regions versus end bud epithelial
cells using T7 amplification and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (Fig.1E). As
expected (13), fibronectin was strongly differentially expressed in cleft epithelial cells
compared to buds (124/20,053 tags versus 4/22,244 tags; P<0.001). Tags corresponding to
Btbd7 (BTB (POZ) domain containing 7) were identified in cleft but not bud cells: 7/20,053
vs. 0/22,244 tags, respectively (P<0.01). This preliminary finding was confirmed by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (qPCR; see below).
The deduced Btbd7 protein contains 1,130-amino acids with 2 putative BTB/POZ domains
(Fig. S3). Regulatory proteins containing BTB domains are evolutionarily conserved from
Drosophila to mammals (20, 21). Btbd7 mRNA expression in developing salivary glands
was highest at embryonic day 13 (E13), a stage of particularly active salivary gland
branching (Fig. 1F,G). Btbd7 expression by in situ hybridization showed striking
concentration around the bottom and lower sides of forming clefts, whereas other salivary
epithelial regions showed little or no expression (Fig. 2A–D, S4). The Btbd7-expressing
cells surround sites of high fibronectin concentration at the base of forming clefts (13, 16),
suggesting that Btbd7 might be induced by fibronectin or other matrix proteins. Because
Btbd7 is also expressed in mesenchyme containing high levels of fibronectin (Fig. S4), we
used mesenchyme-free explants of intact embryonic salivary gland epithelia. Fibronectin
induced Btbd7 expression (P<0.001), whereas collagen I and IV had no effect (Fig. 2E).
Thus, Btbd7 is a fibronectin-induced gene. This Btbd7 induction was accompanied by
morphological conversion of the outer layer of columnar epithelial cells to a less organized
pattern within 2 h (Fig. 2G), which mimicked the cell shape changes in vivo during cleft
formation (e.g., Fig. 1A–C). This fibronectin-induced epithelial disorganization could be
rescued by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of Btbd7 (Fig. 2H, S5).
To identify mechanisms of Btbd7 function, we turned to the well-characterized MadinDarby canine kidney (MDCK) cell model for epithelial cell interactions (22). Transient
Btbd7 transfection of MDCK cells or tetracycline-regulated expression in stably transfected
cells (23) induced labile cell-cell adhesions and scattering of MDCK epithelial cell colonies
to dispersing cell clusters in both 2D cultures and 3D collagen gels (Fig. S6, S7). This cell
dispersal was associated with loss of E-cadherin from cell boundaries according to
immunolocalization (Fig. 3A–F) and 77.1±2.5% decreased Ecadherin protein levels by
immunoblotting (Fig. 3G). Btbd7 expression stimulated the velocity of cell movement in 2D
cell culture two-fold, with increased random migration (Fig. S6). It induced outward cell
dispersal from aggregates in 3D collagen gels (Fig. S7). Therefore, Btbd7 can induce loss of
E-cadherin and increased cell dispersal in 2D and 3D, suggesting that the previously
observed loss of E-cadherin in salivary gland cells adjacent to forming clefts in vivo (13)
was due to the local induction of Btbd7.
Epithelial cell dispersal is often regulated by transcription factors such as Snail, Snail2
(Slug), and Twist1. Btbd7 expression induced Snail2 mRNA in MDCK cells with little
effect on the expression of Snail and Twist1 (Fig. 3H). Immunostaining confirmed that
Btbd7 expression induces Snail2 expression and accumulation of this transcription factor in
the nucleus (Fig. S8). This induction of Snail2 was not required for Btbd7-induced loss of E cadherin (Fig. S9), analogous to the independent regulation of Snail2 and E-cadherin in
HGF-treated MDCK cells (24).
After identifying this putative Btbd7 regulatory pathway in a model epithelial system, we
searched for it in intact embryonic mouse tissues. Besides major increases of fibronectin and
Btbd7 mRNA in cells adjacent to salivary clefts compared to bud epithelial cells of the same
glands, Snail2 mRNA level was also elevated in cells near clefts (3.4-fold, P<0.02; Fig. 4A).
Incubating isolated salivary gland epithelia with purified fibronectin induced Btbd7 rapidly
within 20 min, followed by the induction of Snail2 at 60 min (Fig. 4B). These kinetics in
intact salivary epithelia are consistent with the induction of Snail2 by Btbd7 observed in
MDCK cells in vitro. To test this relationship more directly, we performed siRNA
knockdowns of Btbd7 versus Snail2 in salivary epithelial cultures. Btbd7 knockdown
inhibited fibronectin-induced Snail2 expression, whereas Snail2 knockdown did not affect
Btbd7 expression, indicating that Btbd7 is upstream of Snail2 (Fig. 4C).
To test whether Btbd7 is necessary for branching morphogenesis, we suppressed Btbd7
expression in organ cultures of intact salivary glands using siRNA. Treatment with each of 4
different Btbd7 siRNA sequences produced substantial, morphologically similar suppression
of cleft formation at 48–72 h (Fig. 4D,E and S10). Fewer (64% less) buds formed, but the
buds were larger with the total volume of buds remaining about the same even though
branching was inhibited (Fig. 4F). Cleft propagation speeds measured from time-lapse video
movies (Movie S1) decreased from 6.2±1.1 µm/h in controls to 3.7±1.0 µm/h in Btbd7
knockdown glands, confirming Btbd7’s role in cleft propagation. We also tested whether
Snail2 expression is required for branching morphogenesis using siRNA knockdown.
Branching was inhibited ~67% by inhibition of Snail2 (Fig. S11), confirming its functional
role in branching morphogenesis.
Although Btbd7 is normally expressed only focally in embryonic epithelia, we tested
whether global over-expression by viral gene transfer to developing salivary epithelia could
promote function. Ex vivo fragments of salivary epithelium transduced with adenoviral
Btbd7 showed substantially enhanced tissue spreading (Fig. S12), consistent with the in
vitro stimulation of MDCK cell dispersal by Btbd7. Virus microinjection and expression of
GFP-Btbd7 versus GFP in intact embryonic salivary glands produced a small but
statistically significant increase in branching morphogenesis (Fig. S13). Larger effects might
be found if it were technically feasible to mimic the dynamic translocation of focal Btbd7
expression during cleft formation.
Branching morphogenesis of other organs, such as lungs and kidneys, can differ in the
relative contributions to branching of bud outgrowth versus cleft formation. Nevertheless,
fibronectin contributes to branching morphogenesis in these organs, especially lung (14, 15,
25), suggesting mechanistic commonalities. Although clefts in lung are broad curves rather
than slits, Btbd7 is also expressed in lung at sites of epithelial curvature (Fig. S14).
Branching morphogenesis of embryonic lungs was similarly inhibited by Btbd7 siRNA but
not by control siRNA (Fig. 4G,H). We conclude that Btbd7 is needed for both
mammaliansalivary gland and lung branching morphogenesis.
Our data establish a mechanism for cleft propagation involving Btbd7 as a mediator of
epithelial dynamics and organ branching. A schematic model of this stepwise mechanism is
shown in Fig. S15. The local accumulation of fibronectin in forming clefts rapidly induces
the regulator Btbd7, which in turn induces local expression of the cell-scattering gene Snail2
and suppresses E-cadherin levels, thereby altering cell morphology and reducing cell-cell
adhesion. This stimulates cell separation at the base of forming clefts by local, dynamic
intercellular gap formation and promotes cleft progression. Inhibiting any of these regulatory steps (i.e., fibronectin accumulation or function, Btbd7 expression, or Snail2
expression) inhibits branching morphogenesis. This hierarchy of steps provides a
mechanistic pathway for cleft formation in epithelial branching.

"5. Conclusions
We have shown that the personal doses measured using glass badges in Date city are proportional to the ambient dose rates at the residences of the participants estimated from aircraft monitoring. As a result, the authors conclude that it is possible to predict the external exposure dose received by each individual based on the aircraft monitoring data. The conversion factor derived in the present study, should help greatly in estimating the individual external exposure doses in real life in the contaminated areas affected by the FDNPP accident. The method obtained in this study could aid in the prediction or in the estimation of the external doses of residents in the early phase of future radiation accidents involving large-scale contamination.",1
"Finally, VR presents itself as a promising tool that has until now been underestimated in dentistry. Virtual reality in dentistry has proven to be very effective but still has major limitations because it is necessary for the head to remain still during dental therapy. For this reason, high-quality studies are recommended to evaluate pre-operative VR or applications on new smartphones to prepare patients for dental care and local anesthesia procedures [31,41]. The current work found only a small number of articles in the databases included so the sensitivity of meta-analysis could be affected by various parameters including sample size, study design, and reporting standard. A systematic review should therefore be carried out with a targeted scope towards the use of VR in the dental field only; however, achieving this will require randomized controlled trials that involve the use of a virtual world for each individual dental treatment without differences in the ages of the population analyzed. This would improve statistical effectiveness and reliability. In order to obtain a concrete measurement of when VR affects anxiety and pain in dental treatments, it would be necessary to reduce the risk of uncertainty; eliminate confusing factors, such as the presence of parents during therapy; and establish a clear definition of the appropriate parameters to be measured [44]. Only in this way can the results be scientifically relevant and clinically applicable in support of daily dental practices.
Adapting VR experiences to individual preferences and needs can optimize the effectiveness of the intervention. Customizable content and interactive elements can foster interaction and promote a sense of ownership over the dental experience. In the world today, which is increasingly moving towards the use of artificial intelligence in all sectors, it would be beneficial to strengthen the current techniques of VR and, perhaps, to create a pre-established protocol of use of virtual immersion in patients who on their first visit already demonstrate limits during treatment [59,60].",1
"This edition of Biological Psychiatry includes an important
addition to the RSFC literature from Connolly et al. (1). The
investigators compare RSFC in a sample of 23 adolescents with
major depressive disorder (MDD) and 36 healthy subjects. The
sample is remarkable because patients were medication-free for
at least 2 weeks, and patients and comparison subjects were well
matched for IQ, socioeconomic status, age, sex, ethnicity, and
pubertal stage. Such adolescent samples are difficult to recruit
and study, but it is particularly important to study RSFC in
adolescents with depression because most cases of adult depression begin in adolescence. Thus, adolescence is characterized
both by marked brain plasticity and by rising risk for depression,
providing a potential inflection point for treatments designed to
alter the life-course trajectory of depressive illness.
Connolly et al. (1) use a seed-based analysis focused on the
subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). In MDD versus
healthy subjects, the authors find increased functional connectivity between the sgACC and both the amygdala and the insula. In
addition, the authors report increased negative connectivity
between the sgACC and the precuneus in MDD versus healthy
subjects. Figure 1 depicts the relationships among these structures. The precuneus, adjacent posterior cingulate and retrospenial cortex, and sometimes the sgACC (discussed
subsequently), are considered important nodes in the default
mode network (DMN), a distributed neural network whose
fundamental importance was most persuasively elucidated
through RSFC studies. This network is centered in midline
structures (Figure 1) and tends to show increased activity during
rest and decreased activity during cognitively demanding tasks.
The authors also find that increased rumination is associated with
decreased connectivity between the sgACC and the middle and
inferior frontal gyri.
The results in Connolly et al. (1) include both expected and
unexpected findings. The investigators’ choice of a sgACC seed
was extremely well supported because studies using a variety of
imaging approaches converge on the conclusion that sgACC
dysfunction plays an important role in the pathophysiology of
depression. Such work has led to clinical trials with results
suggesting that deep brain stimulation in this region may have
a therapeutic effect in MDD (2). Thus, one important contribution
in Connolly et al. (1) is to extend to adolescents a focus on the
sgACC that has been a staple of research in adult MDD. Moreover,
as detailed subsequently, some form of perturbed RSFC would be
expected in adolescent MDD, given the longitudinal continuity
between adolescent and adult MDD.
The RSFC literature treats both the ventral medial prefrontal
cortex and the precuneus as vital nodes within the DMN.
However, studies vary as to whether they consider the DMN to
extend as far ventrally and posteriorly as the sgACC (shown in
Figure 1, lying on the posterior and inferior edge of the DMN).
Whether the sgACC is viewed as part of the DMN, studies in MDD
do, with some consistency, find abnormally increased functional
connectivity within the DMN or between the DMN and the sgACC
(3–6). Thus, Connolly et al.’s finding of increased connectivity
between the sgACC and the precuneus is expected. However,
there is one unexpected aspect of this finding: Connolly et al. (1)
report increased negative connectivity between the precuneus
and sgACC, but RSFC networks such as the DMN have historically
been conceptualized as encompassing the regions in Figure 1
with high positive connectivity; negative connectivity among
regions that compose a network is therefore unexpected.
Figure 1. The figure depicts components of the default mode network
(DMN) in red shading. These components include the subgenual anterior
cingulate cortex (sgACC), the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior
cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex/precuneus (PCC/rsC/PreCun). The red
arrow displays connectivity between the sgACC and other components of
the DMN, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and PCC/rsC/PreCun.
In Connolly et al. (1), adolescents with major depressive disorder exhibited
abnormal connectivity between the sgACC and PreCun. The figure also
depicts the insula, where the anterior expanse is shaded in blue. The blue
arrow displays connectivity between the sgACC and anterior insula, which
is a node in another network, the salience network. In Connolly et al. (1),
adolescents with major depressive disorder exhibited abnormal connectivity between the insula and the sgACC, a DMN node.Beyond abnormal sgACC–precuneus connectivity, Connolly et al.
(1) also find increased positive connectivity between the sgACC and
the insula in MDD versus healthy subjects, as also depicted in
Figure 1. Because the insula, rather than the DMN, is commonly
viewed as part of an affective salience-monitoring network, this
finding differs from previous studies reporting increased connectivity within the DMN of depressed subjects. However, Connolly et al.’s
(1) finding does have precedent: several studies in MDD report
abnormal coupling not only within but also between neural
networks. For example, using graph analysis, Zhang et al. (7) found
greater global integration across networks in depressed versus
healthy subjects. Using a different approach, Sheline et al. (4)
reported that, in depressed versus healthy subjects, there was
greater connectivity between a region in the dorsal medial
prefrontal cortex and three major neural networks (cognitive
control, default mode, and affective networks), so that this “dorsal
nexus” functioned as a central hub only in the patients. Although
Connolly et al. use yet a third analytic approach, their finding can be
viewed as broadly consistent with these earlier studies. Taken
together, this work suggests that the sgACC, a central region in the
pathophysiology of depression, may be the site of perturbed
connectivity between the salience and default mode networks.
Finally, Connolly et al. (1) add to the literature by showing
associations between RSFC and clinical measures, including
depression severity, level of impairment, and amount of rumination. The latter is particularly interesting given its theoretical
relevance to RSFC, that is, anterior regions of the DMN are
thought to mediate self-referential thought, including rumination.
Because rumination is a prominent symptom in depression, a
number of RSFC studies in subjects with MDD have examined
associations between rumination and connectivity within the
DMN. For example, Berman et al. (8) found that, compared with
healthy subjects, those with MDD showed increased connectivity
within the DMN (specifically, between sgACC and the posterior
cingulate cortex) during rest but not task periods. Furthermore, in
depressed subjects, connectivity during rest correlated with
measures of rumination. Hamilton et al. (9) devised a quantitative
method for estimating the relative dominance of the DMN and a
task-activated network and reported that, in patients with MDD,
there was a positive correlation between DMN dominance and
depressive rumination. Of note, although the literature tends to
support an association between rumination in depressed subjects
and increased connectivity within the DMN, Connolly et al.’s (1)
finding links rumination with decreased connectivity across
neural networks. Specifically, Connolly et al. (1) report an
association between rumination and decreased connectivity
between the sgACC and both the inferior and medial frontal
gyri, with the latter regions being components of the central
executive network (CEN) that mediates cognition. The authors
suggest that the CEN may function to decrease rumination, so
that patients with relatively low connectivity between the CEN
and sgACC therefore show more prominent rumination.
This growing work on RSFC in MDD has yielded tantalizing
findings, but the devil is very much in the details. That is,
although many studies in MDD find abnormal connectivity, there
is considerable variation across studies in the nature of the
findings, hindering attempts to distill a clear message from the
growing number of studies. Clearer conclusions might emerge
more quickly if one goal of future work was to increase crossstudy coherence in analytic methods. Clearly, it is reasonable for
each research group to use an analytic approach that is ideally
tailored to test their specific hypotheses. However, the beauty of
RSFC is that it also can support shared analytic approaches that
could generate consensus on connectivity in MDD. Given the
relative simplicity of acquisition, RSFC data are well suited for
sharing across sites, and the RSFC research community is to be
commended for actively pursuing open-access data sharing (10).
On the analytic side, after testing study-specific hypotheses with
one analytic approach, RSFC-focused investigators might consider
adopting a second analytic approach that would be implemented
uniformly across all studies of MDD. This could reveal the extent
to which any inconsistency in RSFC findings across age groups
and patient samples arises from inconsistencies in analytic
approaches. In this way, investigators would facilitate crossinstitution collaborations that could generate a consistent message from the impressive and rapidly growing series of RSFC
studies on MDD and other psychopathologies across the life span.
The authors report no biomedical financial interests or potential
conflicts",1
"Conclusion
For the novel talkers in the current experiment, listeners appear to be initially flexible to the most recent biasing information they are provided with, but later go on to aggregate the information they have previously learned about the talker, becoming less flexible. Therefore, listeners seem to use a global integration scheme for new phonetic information, but even within this scheme there are still open questions about the dynamics of this process; future work will need to address how new, unexpected phonetic information from a learned talker is accommodated by the perceptual system, which rapidly adapts despite the wealth of aggregated phonetic information from the talker. A global statistics account in which listeners weighted all tokens from a talker equally would generate the prediction that it would be extremely difficult to adapt to the speech of very well-known talkers if a new perturbation or disruption was introduced. It would mean, for instance, that listeners who had only seen Meryl Streep playing American roles would struggle when confronted with her Polish-accented English in Sophie’s Choice, or that one might fail to understand the distorted speech of one’s parent after dental surgery. Therefore, room needs to be made in this theory for the intervention of top-down expectations to rapidly upweight new phonetic information. This delicate interplay is likely to be an enduring question in the understanding of spoken word recognition.",1
"Conclusion
Our secondary analysis of the prospective multicenter DeFACTO study reveals that there is a significant impact on diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT by the use of β-blockade and nitroglycerin administration, as well as by misalignment artifacts within coronary CTA images.

"Our findings support the functional hypothesis that highly flexible temporomandibular and symphyseal joints are a key evolutionary innovation fueling rorquals' trophic success (Fitzgerald, 2012; Pyenson, 2017; Pyenson et al., 2012), gigantism (Fordyce & Marx, 2018; Goldbogen & Madsen, 2018; Pyenson & Vermeij, 2016), and consequent adaptive radiation (Kimura, 2002; Marx, Lambert, & Uhen, 2016; Thewissen, 2014).

Chlorhexidine application to the cord reduces the risk of neonatal mortality and omphalitis in infants born at home in high-NMR settings.

"In conclusion, although our study failed to reveal the molecular regulatory mechanisms of neuroprotective effect of miR-221 in ischemic stroke, the evidence we pres- ent here suggests that treatment with miR-221 enhances the protection against neurological deficits following MCAO. Since miR-221 prevents cerebral ischemic injury, it is a potential therapeutic target. Clinically, the capacity and safety associated with the injection of miRNA to attenuate cerebral injury after ischemic stroke are still con- cerns. Therefore, future studies still need to explore these issues to better translate this therapy to clinical applica- tion.",1
"In conclusion, the TREM-1/DAP12 along with HMGB1 is significantly increased in obese diabetics and prediabetic patients. Along with TREM1/DAP12 and its ligand HMGB1, TLRs and RAGE were also significantly increased in obese diabetics and can potentially play a significant role in obesity-induced insulin resistance (Figure 7). However, future studies are warranted to identify the role of pathogenic inflammatory cells associated with expression of TREM-1, TREM-2, DAP-12 and other molecules in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance using in vitro and in vivo model. Our findings suggest that TREM-1-induced HMGB1 ligand activation and inflammatory cell receptors (RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2) might ultimately lead to obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Schematic representation of the Inflammation mediated TREM-1 induced insulin resistance. Fat deposition in obesity results in chronic inflammation leading to TREM-1 activation and thereby increased secretion of DAMPs. TREM-1 activation and DAMPs will further activate TLRs and RAGE leading to activation of inflammatory protein kinases and downstream signaling. Activated TLRs will further activate the TREM-1 expression, contributing to the cascade of chronic inflammation. This results in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-alpha, and decreased TREM-2 expression, leading to increased inflammation, TREM-1 expression, and obesity induced insulin resistance. Increased expression of the inflammatory protein kinases reduces results in insulin resistance. The TREM1/DAP12 along with HMGB1, TLRs and RAGE significantly increased in obese diabetics and pre-diabetic patients. Thus TREM-1/DAP12 may potentially play a significant role in obesity-induced insulin resistance.",1
"To conclude, beyond the simple metabolic function of Tps1 via trehalose-6P and trehalose synthesis, our results may allow considering Tps1 as a new, attractive example of “moonlighting” proteins, which are characterized by their ability to perform completely unrelated tasks utilizing regions outside the active site for other functions, mostly regulatory and structural (63). Also, in light of this crucial role of Tps1 in stress resistance, probably through mechanisms that maintain energy homeostasis, our view of survival mechanisms to stress has to be revised and will likely be extendable to other organisms that express Tps1 homologs. These findings finally appear strategic for two relevant yet divergent perspectives. The first one fits with the current interest of many biotechnologically oriented efforts aiming at optimizing the microbial cell factories, particularly yeasts. In addition to their use in traditional fermentation processes, yeasts face growing interest in the exploitation of new C-sources, not only for bioethanol production but also for the white (synthetic) biotechnologies (64–66). All these processes are sources of many adverse situations for these microbial cell factories. Identifying the keys for maintaining or boosting stress resistance is a prerequisite for the robustness of industrial strains, the interplay between Tps1 and energy homeostasis being an appealing target for strain selection and/or engineering. The second perspective relies on the urgent need for new antifungal therapies. The trehalose synthase pathway is widespread in the fungal kingdom where it can be part of the virulence system (23, 67–69), thus making Tps1 a potential antimicrobial target for weakening mammalian and plant pathogenic microorganisms.",1
"4. Conclusions
The use of electronic appliances and its impact in built environment is receiving considerable attention in recent
years. This study aimed to present a novel perspective that will help to understand the linkages that connect the
IEQ and EMF exposure in buildings. Hence, this work included different building environments (conventional as
well as green buildings) to study and develop a novel approach. Study results summarized that relatively lower
EMF emission intensity was found in office premises and comparatively higher power density values were found in
hospitals. Moreover, green building assessment resulted in high EMF emission that indicated the significance of this
novel approach to examine and thereby reducing the EMF radiation propagation. Examination of different building
materials revealed that materials such as ceramic faced lumber, drywall, tile-faced drywall, and masonry or plain
faced concrete showed high shielding effect while glass and plain lumber wall showed the opposite. Therefore,
this study highly recommended the design of sensitive areas in building’s with drywall or ceramic or plain/masonry
faced concrete walls. Also, this study listed some strategies to improve IEQ including utilization of proper shielding
materials, maintaining exposure distance along with exposure duration reduction",1

"In summary, among ESKD patients initiating dialysis in the Southeastern United States, the region with the lowest rates of kidney transplantation in the nation, only 33.7% of patients were referred for transplant within a year of dialysis start, and approximately half of patients do not start the transplant evaluation after referral. National surveillance data should be collected on early transplant steps to help dialysis facilities and transplant centers address the barriers to improve access to transplantation and meet national goals to advance kidney health. Dialysis facility-level interventions are needed to increase referrals among low performing facilities, and transplant center interventions are needed to encourage evaluation start among those referred.",1
"IV. CONCLUSION
In this work we used Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict skin dose changes in 6 MV RBP longitudinal and transverse linac-MR systems. By using FEM we accurately modeled realistic 3D magnetic field maps of linac-MR systems that correctly predict the rapid decay of the fringe fields.

For the longitudinal geometry, simulations of the skin dose in the presence of generic Helmholtz coil systems prove the necessity of incorporating a yoke into the linac-MR model. The EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulations predict that realistic 3D longitudinal fields mostly confine contaminant electrons that are generated in the air gap in the central region, where the main magnetic field exists. The fringe fields are too small to cause appreciable confinement of electrons produced in either the air column or the linac head. Using realistic 3D MRI fields, longitudinal linac-MR systems will result in only a small increase in entrance skin dose. This is contrary to a previous report,15 which relied on the use of a variety of hypothetical 1D forms for the magnetic field maps. The increase in the entrance skin dose of longitudinal linac-MRIs remains below 15% of Dmax for all the simulated scenarios.

For the transverse geometry, the CAX entry skin dose is equal or smaller than that of the zero B-field case for perpendicular beams. When a 10 × 10 cm2 field is obliquely incident on a phantom, the presence of the magnetic field increases the CAX entry skin dose by no more than 10% of Dmax when the magnitude of the angle of obliquity is ≤45°, and in fact decreases the entry skin dose for angles ≤20°. On the exit side, the simulations suggest that the magnetic field does increase the skin dose by up to 42% of Dmax compared to the zero B-field case. The increase in exit skin dose is largest for perpendicular beams, but appreciably drops and approaches the zero B-field case for large oblique angles of incidence. The magnitude of the exit skin dose for our transverse RBP system is comparable to what has been previously reported by Oborn et al.14 for a cylindrical transverse geometry. Since in their work a 1 cm thick exit bolus was found to be a potential solution to significantly reduce the exit dose, we expect that a similar approach will be suitable for the transverse RBP linac-MR system.

Based on our results, we do not expect the changes in skin doses caused by the magnetic field of our RBP linac-MR to be a limitation in the use of the system in either the longitudinal or transverse geometric configurations.",1
"Summary
The increasing cost of healthcare in the U.S. and globally, and restricted resource availability creates difficult resource allocation dilemmas. Decision-makers are tasked with maximizing the utility of these resources to improve societal QoL. HRQoL scores assess multiple aspects of health states. Patient preferences are determined with HRQoL instruments, such as the SF-6D, EQ-5D, and VAS, and utilized to calculate QALYs to enable comparison of interventions. Because the differing underlying techniques of these instruments limit their direct comparability, future study is needed to refine the appropriate usage of these tools for the assessment of shoulder conditions as HRQoL instruments will be increasingly utilized in orthopedic shoulder research to determine cost-effectiveness and value to justify allocation of healthcare expenditure and resources.",1

The addition of selegiline to a low dose of betahistine leads to a significant increase of cochlear microcirculation in the stria vascularis in guinea pigs. Further animal studies should explore the detailed mechanism and dose-effect relationships. Following that, the clinical safety and benefit of a combined administration to MD patients may be explored.",1
"Conclusions
In this paper, I reanalyzed the complexity of the last 122,000 years using the δ18O record of the NGRIP ice core to check the validity of the claims made in1. I explained some of the major misconceptions when applying complexity measures and specifically showed that SampEn is not independent of the length of the dataset in general situations.

To show that the previously published analysis was inaccurate, instead of only comparing the last 2,000 years with the previous 122,000 years, I examined all consecutive sequences of 2,000 years, indicating that the complexity of the recent climate does not stand out from earlier segments of the Holocene or last glacial period. The values obtained for the recent past are within one standard deviation from the mean.

By making proper use of the algorithms, I showed how different epochs have had varying levels of complexity and some periods stand out by having a SampEn above 3 times the standard deviation from the mean. The ability to specify which epochs had greater complexity is useful for paleoclimate research to investigate the causes behind it, providing helpful knowledge to the geophysical community. However, based on the results of this paper, the claim that anthropogenic forcing processes have changed the complexity of the current climate in the last 2,000 years measured by the δ18O record up to a level which is different from previous epochs seems to be unjustified.

Complexity algorithms are an excellent tool to obtain insights about nonlinear dynamic processes and characterize the changes in a system. However, as in any other statistical analysis, it is essential to make a reasonable use of the algorithms by checking that we are not mixing heterogeneous epochs, verifying the effect of the length of the sequences, and studying the stationarity of the data. In general, the algorithms should be used with stationary data. However, it is not uncommon to find applications of ApEn and SampEn to raw data: in those instances, the comparisons should be made between similar systems with the same kind of cycles and trends.

"Conclusions
The effect of gentle vibrotactile stimulation of the body on symptom relief was tested in the framework of a controlled clinical trial in fibromyalgia patients. Results showed significant reduction of pain and fatigue, and sleep quality improved despite the fact that stimulation was applied during sleep time. The degree of improvement and the easy application of our proposal would seem to be sufficiently relevant to suggest a potential role for vibrotactile stimulation in the treatment of fibromyalgia symptoms.",1

"Conclusion
In summary, this comprehensive bioinformatic analysis has identified numerous useful molecular targets for the future investigation of the mechanisms and selection of biomarkers for MDD. Some important biological processes and pathways, including the corticosteroid and glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathways, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the neutrophil activation involved in the immune response, as well as the hub genes working in these processes, may provide novel insights into the development and progression of MDD. Furthermore, the potential molecular mechanisms that have been identified simultaneously include innate immunity, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic factors for synapse function and development. In addition, further molecular biological experiments will be performed by our team to confirm the function of the identified genes in MDD.",1
"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, caffeine supplementation at 5 mg·kg−1 body mass ingested 60 min prior to the CrossFit® workout “Cindy” did not change the number of repetitions performed in CrossFit®-trained men. Additionally, despite the central effects of caffeine, no significant changes in perceptual responses during the exercise bout were found. Caffeine’s ergogenic effects are well documented in the literature but were not present during the CrossFit® workout “Cindy”. Practitioners and athletes should be aware that a learning effect with CrossFit® workouts seems likely and that some caffeine “non-responders” may exist; thus, evaluating caffeine’s effectiveness prior to competition for a specific athlete is encouraged.",1
"4.4. Conclusions and implications for road safety
The present study established the utility of the theoretical approach of the TPB framework in predicting the drunk driving intentions of Indian drivers. It was found that the driver's attitude was the most significant predictor of the drunk driving intention, followed by perceived behavioural control and subjective norms. The additional factors such as traffic fatalism, sensation seeking, and past behaviour also successfully predicted the intention to drink and drive. These significant factors can be targeted in future road safety interventions aiming to reduce road traffic crashes.
The study findings showed that drivers' attitude towards the act of drunk driving was the strongest influencer of their intention to engage in the act. Due to their positive attitudes towards drunk driving, they demonstrated significant positive intentions even after being aware of the detrimental effects of drunk driving on their road safety. This observation makes it crucial for the policymakers to change the public attitude towards the act of drunk driving. Therefore, the road safety awareness campaigns and alcohol deterrence programs should primarily target the drivers' attitudes and try to change their attitudes towards the engagement in the drunk driving incidence. Additionally, the inclusion of the importance of traffic safety culture in school education will help in instilling positive attitudes towards road safety in the students right from their childhood.
The perceived behavioural control was found to be the second most influencing factor predicting the intention to drink and drive, which indicates that the less control perceived by the drivers on the act, the less likely they would choose to engage in the act. Past research has shown that drivers who are more confident of their driving skills are more likely to engage in risky driving behaviour [83]. In this aspect, the road safety programs should aim to make the drivers realize their declining driving control while driving under the influence of alcohol, and the increased possibility of committing road crashes. For this purpose, crash videos and case studies related to drunk driving crashes may prove beneficial in minimizing the perceived behavioural control of the drivers as they would get to have a closer look at the negative aspects of drunk driving.
Subjective norms were also observed as a significant determinant of drunk driving intentions, directing that the perceptions of friends and family members could play a major role in influencing the drunk driving intentions of Indian drivers. In this aspect, billboards/warning instructions can be displayed on the roadsides with the messages such as ‘Your mother will not approve of your drunk driving behaviour’, ‘Your friends will worry about you when you drive under the influence of alcohol’, etc. As people close to an individual play a significant role in daily life, such billboards/warning boards may prove useful in the discouragement of the drunk driving act.
An interesting observation in the present study was that fatalistic beliefs appeared to be a significant predictor of intention to drink and drive, which can be the focus while designing future interventions to prevent drunk driving. The beliefs of an individual can be changed over time with the appropriate road safety awareness programs [47]. Even though the traits of an individual (such as fatalistic beliefs and sensation-seeking behaviour) are difficult to alter, their management and handling can be aimed in future road safety interventions.",1
"The current report demonstrates for the first time that human acinar cells can adopt a β-like phenotype without the need to introduce a combination of pancreatic transcription factors. This acinoinsular reprogramming depends on 3D growth, activation of MAPK/STAT3 signaling and an intermediate Neurog3+ step. Given the volume of human acinar cells discarded upon clinical islet isolation, this approach may present an interesting strategy to increase the amount of transplantable β cells provided the efficiency of cell-type conversion can be improved and the involvement of viruses avoided.

"Conclusion and recommendations
Modifiable risk factors such as poor knowledge and practices need to address immediately. This could be achieved through continuous practical promotional activities by the relevant stakeholders such as the health care provider and school. It is crucial to ensure that intended messages are delivered to increase community awareness of urinary schistosomiasis.

In this review, USC remains a neglected tropical disease that needs further improvement despite various efforts implemented globally. The disparity in the incidence of urinary schistosomiasis between developed and underdeveloped countries is salient. It highlights those necessities, such as clean and adequate water supply, hinder the reduction of urinary schistosomiasis.

Given the negative impact of urinary schistosomiasis, a holistic approach involving the stakeholders such as parents, schools, and the government is needed to control and eliminate urinary schistosomiasis. Apart from that, a multisectoral partnership involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the government is needed to ensure a clean and adequate water supply, as it has an essential role in reducing urinary schistosomiasis in the community.

Further research and development are needed, especially in underdeveloped countries. For example, a non-sewered sanitation system that uses nanomembrane technology could be helpful, especially in a limited water supply [38]. Besides that, policymakers should ensure adequate financing to build the appropriate infrastructure for the water supply.",1
"We are currently investigating, via high-throughput methodologies, the effects of CPZ on GBM cell signaling and energy metabolism, as well as identifying, via mass spectrometry, other relevant cellular factors directly targeted by the drug.

We expect that our in vitro results on the effectiveness of CPZ in restraining GBM cell growth, as well as its synergism with TMZ, could be replicated in the ongoing clinical setting. In addition to such a desirable outcome, which remains the main goal of our efforts, the use of a repurposed medication would allow reducing both development expenses and time predictable for a new drug to travel from the experimental laboratory to the clinics.

"In conclusion, PFAPA syndrome is a very frequent disease of childhood. Pediatricians should keep PFAPA syndrome in mind before prescribing antibiotics when they encounter patients with recurrent fever episodes and pharyngitis, especially when the laboratory data indicate monocytosis associated with neutrophilia and normal serum procalcitonin. Colchicine was effective in decreasing the frequency of fever episodes. But the clinical response to colchicine prophylaxis was better in MEFV gene carriers. Tonsillectomy should be reserved only for treatment-refractory individuals.",1
"Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal no significant difference in clinical outcomes and complication rates between ARIF and ORIF. Additionally, this study found that the complication rate for patients undergoing ARIF falls within previously reported ranges. This suggests that ARIF is a reliable and effective surgical option for treating tibial plateau fractures, even in cases involving high-energy trauma.",1
"The study indicates that young men with a history of criminal offending are more likely to
carry a gun after being exposed to gun-related violence in the community. This is consistent
with other research that has found that emergency room patients who are treated for firearmrelated injuries are at heightened risk of future violent behavior (including firearm carrying),
in addition to future firearm related injuries and even firearm-related death (42). Taken
together, the results suggest that a comprehensive approach to prevent adolescent and young
adult gun carrying should include empirically-based strategies designed to reduce overall
levels of gun violence in the communities to which young people are exposed, such as
targeting policing strategies (43). In addition, trauma-informed interventions that target
adolescents and young adults exposed to gun violence could be pivotal in preventing future
gun-related morbidities and mortalities. Toward this end, hospitals and mental health care
systems should screen and refer vulnerable patients to trauma-informed intervention
programs (44)—because doing so could ultimately save lives.",1
"Conclusions
In conclusion, our results suggest that female APOE-ε4 carriers are most sensitive to testosterone’s effects on cognitive performance. We demonstrated that in female APOE-ε4 carriers, lower plasma testosterone was associated with worse global cognition, processing speed, and verbal memory, but found no associations between testosterone and cognition in female APOE-ε4 non-carriers, nor in men, regardless of APOE-ε4 status or whether testosterone levels were in the low range for males. These analyses underscore the importance of considering sex and APOE-ε4 status in testosterone and brain health studies, and posits potential for modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline, particularly among women at higher genetic risk for AD.",1

"Conclusions
In this large, patient-level analysis of 2 pivotal trials, while we observed overall benefit comparing sacubitril/valsartan to RAS inhibition, these findings were driven by benefit in patients with chronic HF and LVEF below the normal range. In contrast, patients at the highest end of the ejection fraction range demonstrated lower overall mortality, higher proportions of noncardiovascular death, and did not appear to benefit from sacubitril/valsartan compared with RAS inhibition. These data suggest that the therapeutic effects of sacubitril/valsartan, compared with a RAS inhibitor alone, vary by LVEF, with treatment benefits, particularly for heart failure hospitalization, that appear to extend to patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction. These therapeutic benefits appeared to extend to a higher LVEF range in women compared with men.",1
"3 Conclusion
Because multiple mechanical factors (e.g., the applied force, material softness, and the thickness of the object) can influence contact force, existing tactile technology for robots mainly focuses on touch or contact force sensing with little self-adaptive ability to perceive the object's deformability in unstructured environments. Extracting effective cutaneous cues from the complex deformation by a tactile sensor, while eliminating the disturbing factors, is crucial to estimating the material softness of an interacting object. This study introduces a soft tactile sensor based on a self-decoupled mechanical design, mimicking two SA mechanoreceptors under human skin to resolve multiple localized cues. Our sensor features a hyperelastic strain-responsive layer with a high Poisson ratio, paired with a porous pressure-responsive material with a low Poisson ratio, which enables it to capture contact pressure and surface strain signals at the same location with negligible interference. Compared to only local contact force, two orthometric local cues in the identical site more sufficiently represent the complex deformation of the soft contact medium. By coordinating the sensor's selective sensing field and sensitivity, we demonstrate its ability to quantitatively estimate the material softness over a wide range on the Shore OO scale, ranging from 11.2 to 82.7, achieving an RMSE of 6.30. Integrating bimodal cutaneous cues enable the material softness measurement even in the presence of confounding factors, such as variations in thickness or applied force. Our sensor even demonstrates superior capability in material softness discrimination over the average level of human ability.

Moreover, we propose that the object's deformability must comprehensively include both material softness and compliance to describe the overall deformation and surface deformation capability fully. This concept particularly applies to robots engaged in unstructured grasping tasks. With the displacement information from the haptic system in a robot, the proposed tactile sensor can synergistically endow the deformable object with multiple relevant physical attributes, building a rich tactile expression from material to structure. Challenging tasks, including material discrimination, complex object classification, and self-adaptive grasping, illustrate that our approach is competent in elaborate tactile perception, demonstrating its potential in intelligent prosthetics and robots.

In perspective, although we have introduced a single-pixel device to mitigate the impact of object curvature on the perception of deformation attributes, achieving tactile perception for object recognition and fine manipulation strategy planning requires both miniaturization and high-density arraying of the biomimetic receptors to accommodate the curvature, shape, and size of objects. In our future work, we'll aim to address several challenges. Firstly, device performance such as sustainability, reliability, robustness, and consistency, must be considered when scaling down and integrating large amounts of flexible sensors. Secondly, we need to increase the level of distributed processing to balance the trade-off between high-speed data transmission and high channel capacity for real-time requirements in robotics. Finally, the sensor-centralized design paradigm of an intelligent tactile system must be optimized to achieve an excellent combination of sensors and machine learning methods. These improvements will promote sensorimotor control of complex manipulation devices (such as dexterous hands) in time-dynamic tasks, promoting practical applications of robotic hands and bionic prostheses.",1
"These findings naturally raise questions about the ethics of applying interventions to
individuals or communities without their consent or awareness. If developed, an appropriate and
ethical manner for applying a wise intervention such as this would be to empower individuals or
communities to use the intervention intentionally and with full awareness of the expected outcomes.
Nonetheless, the concept of using stimuli to change health behaviors without the consent of
individuals or the community is not without precedent. Advertising and even health messaging is
applied to individuals and communities by profit, non-profit, and governmental organizations with the
intention of changing individuals‟ behaviors. One might argue that there is sometimes awareness
among the implementers that there will be differential effects on different social groups as well.
Before the innovation proposed here is developed into an intervention, a thorough discussion of the
ethics of the application would be in order.
This is an initial, formative examination into the development of a wise intervention based on
priming to decrease delay discounting. As such, the findings represent a proof of concept with a
number of limitations. Future research will need to obtain baseline discounting rates to rule out
differences in discounting rates among the participants assigned to the conditions. Although unlikely,
possibilities exist that baseline differences in discounting rates contributed to the findings in this
study. Ideally, baseline discounting rate assessments would be sufficiently separated in time from the
outcome assessment to prevent carry over effects. Future research will need to provide evidence of the 
17
effects of patterns of exposure especially if the intervention is expected to have long-term effects
health behaviors. These findings might be limited by the characteristics of the population of MTurk
workers who participated. Applications in other groups, especially groups at highest risk for
problematic health behaviors, are needed. Finally, it should be noted that the active control, the PF
condition, was not effective at increasing delay discounting. We speculate that these findings might
have resulted from inadequate stimulus development, or perhaps discounting is more amendable to
reductions through this type of intervention or platform, or in this population. Nonetheless, the goal of
the study was to decrease discounting because of the associated health benefits, but increasing
discounting should also be the focus of future research because it is likely to elucidate the parameters
of altering this important and modifiable characteristic. ",1
"CONCLUSION
In our three experiments, we showed that women’s heel height exerts an effect on men’s behavior and judgment. We found that men were more willing to interact with a woman wearing high heels and that they perceived such a woman to be more attractive. We also found that men’s desire to meet a woman was mediated by the level of attractiveness of the woman.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that an effect of women’s heel height has been found on men’s behavior. Previous research indicated that women’s clothing appearance exerts an effect on men’s judgment and behavior toward them (Abbey, Citation1987; Abbey et al., Citation1987; Guéguen, Citation2011a, Citation2012b; Koukounas & Letch, Citation2001; Niesta Kayser et al., Citation2010; Shotland & Craig, Citation1988). However, none of these studies examined the effect of shoes and more specifically the effect of heel height. Morris et al. (Citation2013) reported that the gait of women wearing high heels was perceived as more feminine, but they did not examine men’s judgment of attractiveness and desire to meet the women wearing high heels. Indeed, their target was presented with the help of point-light videos of the women walking, whereas in our study, the participants were exposed to real women wearing high-heeled shoes and to a static target.

Findings from our three experiments confirm that men focus on women’s physical attributes when judging and interacting with them. Previous studies have shown that men value physical appearance in short-term mating (Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, & Kenrick, Citation2002; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, & Linsenmeier, Citation2002; Li & Kenrick, Citation2006; Sprecher & Regan, Citation2002) and in long-term relationships (Buss, Citation1989; Kenrick et al., Citation1993; Shackelford et al., Citation2005). Research has also reported that various elements of women’s physical appearance are used by men to evaluate the mating value of a woman. Morphological factors are not the only cues associated with men’s judgment. Research studies have indicated that clothing appearance (Abbey, Citation1987; Abbey et al., Citation1987; Guéguen, Citation2011b; Koukounas & Letch, Citation2001; Shotland & Craig, Citation1988), clothing color (Guéguen, Citation2012b; Niesta Kayser et al., Citation2010), cosmetics (Cash et al., Citation1989; Jacob, Guéguen, Boulbry, & Ardicioni, Citation2009), or hair color (Guéguen & Lamy, Citation2009; Swami & Barrett, Citation2011) were related to variation in men’s approach to and judgment of women. In accordance with these studies, it seems that shoes, more particularly shoe heel height, also act as a factor influencing men’s approach to and judgments of women’s attractiveness.",1
"5 Conclusion
This meta-analysis showed that OCT-guided PCI was associated with lower MAPE, a composite of ST, DE, and DED, compared to IVUS-guided PCI at 30 days. However, there was no difference in overall MACE, target vessel MI, TVR, and nonfatal stroke at 1 year. While IVUS is a safe and effective adjuvant to guiding the optimal placement of coronary stents, OCT is a reasonable option. These findings should be considered hypothesis-generating as more high-fidelity trials are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlining these outcomes (Central Illustration 1).",1
"Conclusion
By adopting a computational psychiatry approach [61–65] to data from an inference task with a social component, we show that BPD patients exhibit an aberrant pattern of learning rate adjustment when the environment becomes more volatile. Instead of quickly relearning changed contingencies, they show exaggerated volatility learning. While SCZ and MDD patients showed a tendency to the same pattern, they did not significantly differ from controls in this respect. We also show that BPD and SCZ patients rely more strongly than controls on social-domain beliefs relative to non-social-domain beliefs when making decisions even in a task where doing the opposite would have given them an advantage. Taken together, this shows that there are computational commonalities as well as differences between patient groups, which suggests some underlying mechanisms that may be shared across diagnoses. Since this approach allows for individually quantifying the severity of impairment at a mechanistic level, it has the potential to lead to diagnostic and prognostic advances. Furthermore, it points the way to possible targets for novel interventions which transcend traditional diagnostic boundaries.",1
"Conclusion
In the current systematic review of recent literature, a similar revision rate is observed as in a previous systematic review thirteen years ago. In this review, we searched for modes of failure, which has not been done before. Aseptic loosening and infection remain the foremost reasons for revision. Linked arthroplasties tend to have more revisions due to polyethylene wear, where unlinked designs have more revisions due to instability and dislocations. Periprosthetic fractures are the third most frequent reason for revision. Elbow arthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis has higher revision rates than post-traumatic osteoarthritis and in trauma.

"Conclusions
Collectively, we found an elevated circRNA circPPP1R12A in the cytoplasm of CC tissues and cells. In addition, evidence indicated that the circRNA circPPP1R12A encoded a conserved 73-aa small peptide, PPP1R12A-C. The PPP1R12A-C peptide, not circPPP1R12A circRNA itself, promoted the growth of CC cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, circPPP1R12A-73aa promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of CC cells via activating Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Taken together, our study intuitively illustrated the coding potential of circRNAs in the progression of CC. Moreover, our findings might provide valuable insights into the development of potential therapeutic targets for CC.",1

"Conclusions
The performed comparison of the methods leads to several
parameters, around which the following conclusions can be
presented:
1. Due to the capacity of the mitochondria to accumulate
the cationic dyes and quench the fluorescence, a low
concentration of an uncoupler, 10 μM CCCP or FCCP
should be used without affecting the PMP.
2. The fluorescence changes resulting from binding of the
dye to the surface of the cells can be avoided by the use
of low concentrations of a divalent cation. Because of
the variable capacity of the cells to transport divalent
cations, it is preferable to use starved cells. Although
with starved cells, around 200 μM Ca2+ allows for
reasonable estimations; adequate results can also be
obtained with 5 to 10 μM BaCl2.
3. Not just any dye is equally useful for the estimations.
Comparison of the dyes favors the use of DiSC3(3),
which can be equally useful at 200 nM or 1.0 μM. In
addition, with this method, a reasonable range of cell
amounts can be used, but it seems desirable to use
between 25 and 50 mg wet weight.
4. The buffer used should be carefully considered to avoid
the presence of ions that may affect the PMP. The use of
10 mM MES-taken to pH 6.0 with TEA is recommended.
5. Although some laboratories may have adequate instruments, measurement of fluorescence intensity at around
540 and 590 nm for excitation and emission, respectively,
appears to be easy with any simple spectrofluorometer.
Measurement of the difference of the emitted fluorescence
at two wavelengths may also be adequate. The fluorescence changes ought to be presented in full, because they
do not follow a simple course, neither they reach a
constant value, so they should not be presented only as the
final numerical value of the fluorescence change.
6. The measurement of the accumulation of DiSC3(3) may
be a useful approximation to obtain quantitative estimations of the PMP of yeast and its variations under the
influence of different agents or conditions. The conditions so far explored would indicate the use of the full
incubation mixture described in Table 1 with either
200 nM or 1.0 μM of the dye.
7. Any strain should be tested about the reliability of the
method by simple procedures, comparing the fluorescence
changes or accumulation ratios of the cyanine in presence
and absence of a substrate (glucose), the capacity of low
concentrations of K+
, but not of Na+
, to decrease the
fluorescence signal, or the addition of agents, such as
amiodarone, known to produce K+ efflux.",1

"Conclusion
The use of fertility tracking applications is not uncommon amongst sexually active women in reproductive age, and the majority of users rely on them to track their fertility window. However, the efficacy of such applications as a method of contraception is not high, and there is a significant failure rate especially if used alone, so we advise such group of women to use a reliable method of contraception.

We suspect the demand and use of such applications to grow over the next years. Thus, we recommend the comparison between different applications to assess their individual efficacies and that a larger study should be conducted in the future while taking into account the use of such applications alone or with other methods of contraception.

Since the user is considered to be the greatest ‘risk factor’ in the efficacy of such apps, we recommend the collaboration between app developers, women’s health experts, and consumer groups to ensure that women have access to fertility apps that meet their specific needs and minimize the risk of failure as much as possible.",1
"Conclusion
Vitamin D deficiency is a frequent finding among children with ASD. Like two other groups, we found the
severity of the deficiency is significantly inversely
associated with autism rating scales.
Vitamin D is inexpensive, readily available and safe.
It may have beneficial effects in ASD subjects,
especially when the final serum level is more than
40 ng/ml. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in autistic children. A baseline measurement of 25-OHD level
should be obtained to determine the dosage that will
result in a final 25-OHD of at least 40 ng/ml.
There are an increasing number of studies
suggesting an important link between low vitamin D
and ASD. Randomized controlled trials using adequate doses of vitamin D3 are urgently needed.

293 of fracturing fluid and the morphology of natural fractures during hydraulic fracturing
294 play an important role in controlling the interaction behavior of hydraulic fractures with
295 natural fractures. When the hydraulic fracture does not encounter the natural fracture,
296 it is easier to generate simple, straight, and symmetric bi-wing hydraulic fracture; when
297 the hydraulic fracture interacts with the natural fracture, the hydraulic fracture
298 morphology becomes curved and complex, and the more complex the natural fracture
299 morphology is, the more complex the morphology of the generated fracture network is.

301 on the natural crack, with the increase of the degree of curvature of the natural crack
302 (curvature increase), the hydraulic fracture gradually changes from crossing the natural
303 fracture and expanding along the natural fracture to extending only along the natural
304 fracture, and ultimately extending along the direction of the maximum horizontal

Increased years of marijuana use or cigarette smoking are
associated with unhealthy levels of the components of metabolic
syndrome among adults in the US. With the inclination for
recreational marijuana use, this relationship may be considered
critically to avert future metabolic complications. The duration of
marijuana use or cigarette smoking is potentially an important
factor in assessing metabolic health. With prolonged years of use,
the effects on metabolic health might be unfavorable. We also
found that marijuana use like cigarette smoking is also associated
with hypertension. Our research seeks to add to the geminating
interest in research on metabolic syndrome and marijuana use and
cigarette smoking as an illuminating pathway to addressing
recreational substance use and factors associated with cardiometabolic diseases, a major cause of morbidity and mortality.",1
"Conclusions
  The new findings at Monte Alegreconfirm that some of the pictographs served astronomical and apparently calendric functions. As such, they seem to be the earliest pictographs in the Americas, among the early uses of rock art as landscape delimiters, and they constitute the earliest evidence of an archaeoastronomyobservatory currently known. The ancient paintings also provide a glimpse at the cosmology of a late Pleistocene culture, their associative and relational understanding of the world, and one of their strategies for adjusting to a new landscape. This was a period of time when humanswere pioneering new habitats in the Americas. Here, near the equator, there is little seasonal variation in daylight hours, temperature, precipitation phases, and the shedding of foliage unlike at higher latitudes.However, the position of the sun, and the direction that it casts shadows doprovide reliable seasonal indicators. By using rock art to track horizon sightings at severaldistinct sites, the painters show skill at complex pattern recognition. Through studying the things they depicted sun, stars, comets we can begin to understand how they may have utilized those occurrences to predictively organize economic and social activities around environmental resource oscillations during the initial human occupation of the Amazon.",1

"To conclude, we have demonstrated that the proportion of upwards transitions to overweight and obese categories in the South African population increases sharply between the ages of 19 and 50 years. Once overweight or obese, the likelihood of transitioning to a normal BMI is low, particularly for women, those of higher age groups, and those with a higher income and a higher level of education. With this evidence, we provide essential guidance for the South African Department of Health in the development of strategies to control obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Our study results will allow limited public health resources to be focused on the necessary population segments in which the largest reductions in the prevalence of obesity can be made.",1

MC-25-41, a highly selective D3R partial agonist with a long half-life, reduces cocaine-motivated behaviors on high and low-effort schedules and may have an impact on reward efficacy. Furthermore, the analysis of MC-25-41 pharmacological effects using a behavioral economics framework is a novel approach for evaluating pharmacotherapeutics targeting the dopamine system. This approach identified effects on motivation, specifically an increase in demand elasticity, missed by traditional analysis of cocaine self-administration dose-response data. These findings together with the promising pharmacokinetic properties of MC-25-41 suggest it may be a useful pre-clinical candidate for the treatment of CUD.",1
"In summary, we have demonstrated how plasma cells from an RA inflamed joint, as well as B cells from the circulation of RA patients, can produce antibodies that, on the one hand, have undergone extensive hypermutation and, on the other hand, react with a massive number of different PTM peptides and proteins with similar, but distinct, recognition amino acid patterns for each of the investigated mAb. We envision that such scenarios may also be valid for other autoimmune diseases in which potentially pathogenic antibodies, which develop over several years, may recognize different targets in different organs. Thus, studies on cross-reactivity patterns, in particular in the context of PTMs or other protein modifications, may provide us with new leads concerning both triggering and targeting of B cells involved in complex inflammatory diseases like RA.",1
"Previous studies have treated darkness as just one of many factors that induce a state of
deindividuation (e.g., Zimbardo, 1969), but out studies suggest that the experience of darkness,
combined with the difficulty of transcending one’s own phenomenological experience, triggers a
fundamental psychological belief that one is protected from others’ attention and inspections. Our
results suggest that darkness, even experienced one-sidedly through the act of wearing sunglasses, can
have potentially harmful consequences. Thus, Emerson may have been correct when he stated that

"Conclusions
In this nationally representative survey of adults in the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in 2013-2014 was 35.0% among men and 40.4% among women. The corresponding values for class 3 obesity were 5.5% for men and 9.9% for women. For women, the prevalence of overall and class 3 obesity both showed a significant linear trend between 2005 and 2014; there were no significant trends for men. Other studies are needed to determine the reasons for these trends.",1
"CONCLUSIONS
The GWAS of dairy cattle should adhere to analytical rigor to control for multiple testing correction, population stratification, and familial relatedness; and should also include appropriate quality controls for both genotype and phenotype data. If the study objective is gene discovery, minimizing the false-positive rate is more important than controlling the false-negative rate. A genome-wide significance threshold (nominal P-value 5 × 10−8 for GWAS) is recommended for GWAS with WGS variants. Replication studies that consider bulls and cows as independent populations should be completed and followed by meta-analysis. If the study objective is to investigate genetic architecture (e.g., to understand the extent to which epistatic or gene–environment interactions control phenotypic variation), controlling for both type-I and type-II errors is extremely important to ensure statistical robustness. If the objective is to validate candidate SNPs by constructing custom SNP arrays, the significance threshold may be relaxed and more weight can be placed on functional annotation of variants.
Appendix 1. GBLUP and SNP-BLUP Approaches for GWAS
The GBLUP and SNP-BLUP approaches estimate all SNP effects simultaneously for all genotyped individuals with performances. Although SNP effect estimates are strongly regressed, SNP-BLUP-derived test statistics for marker effects are equivalent to those obtained from single-SNP linear regression (e.g., by using EMMAX; Gualdrón Duarte et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). Because a QTL effect is distributed over several neighboring SNPs, SNP signals must be collected in intervals. As the GBLUP model is equivalent to SNP-BLUP, it can be used for the same purpose, after back-solving for SNP effects. This approach can also be extended to a population of genotyped and ungenotyped animals in the so-called single-step approach, thus allowing the analysis of complex data sets (Aguilar et al., 2019). Again, single-step GBLUP (Legarra et al., 2009; Christensen and Lund, 2010) and single-step SNP-BLUP (Legarra and Ducrocq, 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Fernando et al., 2014; Aguilar et al., 2019) can be used similarly, as their models are equivalent to estimate both breeding values and marker effects. Both approaches have been used for GWAS (Tiezzi et al., 2015; Aguilar et al., 2019).
However, GBLUP- and SNP-BLUP-based approaches have 2 important limitations:
(a)
The SNP effects are very strongly regressed and the estimated effect of the top variant is much lower than the true effect. Indeed, the equation corresponding to SNP i is of the forms 
 where mi is the vector of centered genotypes for SNP i, yc is the vector of phenotypes adjusted for the effects of all other SNPs and other effects in the model, and 
 with 
 the residual, SNP, and genetic variances, respectively, and pj the minor allele frequency of variant j. In many analyses, this coefficient λ is larger than the number of data and the SNP effect is strongly regressed toward zero. The QTL effect is thus distributed over many markers, in the QTL region but sometimes also at long distance. To obtain a realistic estimate of the variance associated with a QTL, it is necessary to combine the effects of all markers of the region, and even so, the explained variance is still underestimated (e.g., see Sanchez et al., 2022, for an illustration).
(b)
GBLUP and SNP-BLUP are suitable methods for moderate numbers of markers, of the order of a few tens of thousands of markers. However, when GWAS analyses aim to identify the best candidate causal variants, this implies performing the analyses at the sequence level. With this very large number of WGS variants, the limitations described above are greatly amplified, preventing use of GBLUP in practice for association studies.
Appendix 2. Bayesian Methods Applied to GWAS
Bayesian methods provide an alternative approach to assessing associations and mitigate the limitations of P-values, but come with the cost of additional modeling assumptions (Stephens and Balding, 2009). Allowing different prior distributions, the Bayesian methods provide a way to allocate different variances to SNPs and therefore to highlight the SNP with the strongest effect: their effect is less regressed. In the models with SNP selection, their probability of inclusion in each category is a direct mapping method. A whole alphabet of methods has been proposed, including methods enabling the selection of SNPs [e.g., BayesB (Meuwissen et al., 2001), BayesC (Habier et al., 2011), BayesR (Erbe et al., 2012)] and variable SNP variances [e.g., BayesA (Meuwissen et al., 2001), BayesB, or BayesR].
Sahana et al. (2010) compared Bayesian multiple regression analysis with LMM GWAS. Fernando and Garrick (2013) described Bayesian methods to combine large numbers of genotyped and nongenotyped animals for whole-genome analysis. In spite of their useful properties, Bayesian methods have limitations at the sequence level. Each QTL signal is scattered over multiple neighboring markers in strong LD, and, as with the SNP-BLUP approach, SNP signals must be collected in intervals (Sahana et al., 2010). Chen et al. (2017) reported advantages of a variable selection approach using LD-based windows. The second limitation is the computing cost, and Bayesian methods at a whole-sequence level are currently not computationally feasible on a routine basis.",1

Findings demonstrate some agreement between different measures of sweet taste liking and wide differences between individuals in this liking. There is also some suggestion that higher liking for sweet foods is associated with increased sweet food selection and sugar consumption in a restricted scenario, but there is very little support for the suggestion that sweet taste liking is associated with either free sugar or total sugar intakes in a free-living situation. These findings cast doubt on the assumptions that sweet taste preferences are naturally high for all and that free sugar intakes are a result of sweet taste preferences.",1

In the first 18 months of the MSIR’s operation in Melbourne, almost a third of PWID enrolled in a Melbourne-wide cohort had used the facility. The study
findings show that the MSIR has been successful in

harm and therefore attracting most PWID in need of
this service, adding further to the evidence that SIFs
attract those most likely to benefit from them. This vulnerability needs to be considered in examining the
impacts of the facility on harms related to injecting drug
use. Further prospective analyses of this cohort, modeled
on similar work using prospective cohort studies in Vancouver, are needed to determine the causal impacts of
the MSIR on clients’ health and social outcomes.",1
"In summary, our data indicate that CD34+ cells, megakaryocytes and platelets express functional TLR3. Activation of this receptor in megakaryocytes results in an IFN‐β‐mediated reduction in platelet generation, suggesting a potential role for TLR3 in the thrombocytopenia observed in viral infections. In addition, stimulation of TLR3 primes platelets for activation mediated by classic agonists. Whether this effect compensates for the decreased platelet number induced by activation of TLR3 on megakaryocytes or whether it has a thrombotic effect during viral infections requires further investigation.",1

This systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for severe perineal lacerations provides comprehensive insights to guide future clinical practice. In the future, nurses and midwives should thoroughly evaluate the risk of severe perineal lacerations before vaginal delivery, and consider performing episiotomy in forceps delivery. In addition, our findings provide evidence to refine current risk assessment tools, which should include risk factors for severe perineal lacerations as fully as possible. As many risk factors could lead to severe perineal lacerations and may be interrelated, future studies are required to examine their combined effects on severe perineal lacerations.",1

"Between Jan 1, 2001, and Oct 31, 2018, total mortality declined by 32% in men and 31% in women with diagnosed diabetes. Death rates declined from 40·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 27·8 deaths per 1000 person-years in men and from 42·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 29·5 deaths per 1000 person-years in women with diagnosed diabetes. We found similar declines in individuals without diabetes, hence the gap in mortality between those with and without diabetes was maintained over the study period. Cause-specific death rates declined in ten of the 12 cause groups, with exceptions in dementia and liver disease, which increased in both populations. The large decline in vascular disease death rates led to a transition from vascular causes to cancers as the leading contributor to death rates in individuals with diagnosed diabetes and to the gap in death rates between those with and without diabetes.",1
Conclusions: We provide additional evidence that CCBs do not influence breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women.,1
"this conclusion is tempered by the fact that assessment of mATP binding rates is complicated by the competing reactions of hydrolysis and motor stepping as well as the fact that for mADP there were no substantial differences between the strained and unstrained exchange rates for KIF3A14 (Fig. 7, a and b).The present work brings into question some of the conclusions from a recent biochemical study by Albracht et al. (64) that used similar methods to investigate the hydrolysis cycle of KIF3A/B heterodimers. Both studies used mouse KIF3, and we showed previously that the motility characteristics of heterodimeric KIF3A/B and homodimeric KIF3A/A are similar under unloaded conditions (28). Hence, there is no evidence that discrepancies between the two studies result from differences in the motor constructs employed. As argued below, we contend that our results are in fact consistent with the experimental data of Albracht et al. (64), but we differ significantly on the interpretation of the results.
The first conclusion from the Albracht et al. study (64) was that ADP release at 12 s−1 is the rate-limiting step in the KIF3A/B hydrolysis cycle. This conclusion came from a sequential release experiment (mADP-loaded motors are flushed against microtubules in the presence of saturating ATP, leading to a fall in fluorescence) that was very similar to our sequential release experiments in Fig. 4d (which also yielded a rate of 12 s−1). Albrecht et al. (64) interpreted this rate as the ADP off-rate from a single head. In contrast, we interpret this process as sequential nucleotide release involving microtubule binding and mADP release from the first head (measured at 26 s−1 in the konMt experiment in Fig. 4a) followed by rapid ATP binding and release of the second mADP (measured at 21 s−1 by the half-site experiment in Fig. 3e). In Fig. 4d, we used a kinetic model to show that sequential release with these measured rates leads to the 12 s−1 measured experimentally. More importantly, we show in Fig. 3 that the affinity of KIF3 motors for mADP is 15-fold higher than the affinity for unlabeled nucleotide. Hence, we disagree that for the normal ATP hydrolysis cycle, ADP release is rate-limiting, and rather than the 12 s−1 from Albracht et al. (64), we model koffADP at 390 s−1 (Table 2) based on our work. This high affinity for mant-nucleotides may also partly explain the high apparent ATP affinity (Kd,ATP = 6.1 μm from mATP binding) that Albracht et al. (64) were unable to reconcile with their measured ATP dependence of ATPase and motor detachment (118 and 133 μm, respectively, using unlabeled ATP).
The second discrepancy with the previous work was that Albracht et al. (64) contend that ATP hydrolysis is partially rate-limiting at 33 s−1 for KIF3A/B, which contrasts with our modeled hydrolysis at 478 s−1 (Table 2). From acid quench experiments involving rapid mixing of ATP with preformed KIF3A/B-Mt complex, Albracht et al. (64) measured a burst of ATP hydrolysis at 33 s−1, with the key detail that the amplitude of the burst was 3 ATP/active site (or 6 ATP/dimeric motor). Were the burst amplitude less than or equal to 1 ATP/motor dimer, the data would be consistent with a burst of hydrolysis at 33 s−1, but the burst of 6 ATP/dimer suggests that the experiment is actually measuring multiple steps by the motor and is, at best, only a lower limit for the ATP hydrolysis rate. Our modeling constrains the ATP hydrolysis rate only weakly (between 47 and 967 s−1; Table 2), but based on our interpretation, this is not inconsistent with the results of Albracht et al. (64).
The third discrepancy between the studies concerns the rate of trailing head detachment during motor stepping, which Albracht et al. (64) estimate to be 22.3 s−1 based on the fall in light scattering resulting from rapidly adding ATP to preformed KIF3A/B-Mt complexes. If the light scattering signal is to be considered a measure of the trailing head detachment rate, then the motor must bind and hydrolyze one ATP molecule and then dissociate without taking a step (because even taking one step would require detachment of both heads for the motor to dissociate). Albracht et al. (64) added 100 mm KCl to the buffer to minimize the number of steps before dissociation, but pulse-chase and acid quench experiments under similar conditions showed bursts of 3 ATP/active site (6 ATP/dimeric motor). Thus, a more conservative interpretation of the data is that the rate measured by light scattering provides only a lower limit for trailing head detachment, meaning that it is fully consistent with our estimate for kdetach of 89 ± 25 s−1 (Table 2).
The final discrepancy with the Albracht et al. work concerns the sequence of steps in the hydrolysis cycle. Albracht et al. (64) assume that during motor stepping, ATP binding to the bound head leads to stepping followed by ADP release by tethered head, and only then is ATP hydrolyzed by the first head. More precisely, following state 4 in our Fig. 1 (corresponding to state E3 from Albracht et al. (64)), states 5 and 6 are replaced by a two-head-bound state (E4) with no nucleotide in the leading head and ATP in the trailing head, which then resolves to our state 7 (E5). The first problem is that, whereas our framework provides a pathway for motor detachment, the Albracht cycle does not. Second, our framework is supported by recent work by Milic et al. (42) that showed that slowing ATP hydrolysis (by using ATPγS) does not enhance processivity, arguing that ATP hydrolysis in the bound head precedes binding and ADP release by the tethered head. Third, although AMPPNP does trigger mADP release by the second head, we found the maximal rate to be only 5.9 s−1 (Fig. 5b), compared with >47 s−1 by the pathway in Fig. 1. Thus, although a bifurcation of the cycle following state 4 cannot be ruled out, at a minimum, stepping before hydrolysis is strongly disfavored kinetically. In summary, although our results are consistent with the experimental data of Albracht et al. (64), our interpretations of the results differ markedly.
The present work provides a biochemical framework in which to interpret previous kinesin-2 observations and provides insight into the role of kinesin-2 in cells. It was shown previously that during processive stepping, kinesin-2 readily detaches under load (29, 56, 65). This behavior can be explained by our finding here that the motor spends a significant fraction of its hydrolysis cycle in a weakly bound state that would be expected to detach under load. Kinesin-2 was found to step around obstacles more efficiently than kinesin-1, and beads coated with many kinesin-2 motors were observed to take spiral paths along microtubules, both of which could also be attributed to the motor residing in a weak binding state that can diffuse on the microtubule lattice (66, 67). One question that this work does not answer is why shortening the kinesin-2 neck linker from 17 to 14 residues enhances motor processivity (18). Based on the model for the KIF3A hydrolysis cycle developed here, not only is an effect on front head gating (nucleotide binding) ruled out, but increasing the trailing-head detachment rate by shortening the neck linker is also not predicted to enhance processivity. This question will be best addressed in future experiments by directly measuring the attachment and detachment rate constants in the hydrolysis cycle and determining their dependence on neck linker length.
In terms of its transport function in cells, the fact that kinesin-2 spends a large fraction of its cycle in a microtubule-associated weak binding state means that opposing forces generated by dynein bound to the same cargo will tend to overwhelm kinesin-2. However, the motor is also predicted to maintain its association with the microtubule when it is being pulled in the opposite direction, which may enhance directional switching following the termination of the dynein run. These results highlight the specialization of different kinesin transport motors and provide constraints for understanding bidirectional transport by combinations of different kinesins and opposed teams of kinesins and dyneins.",1

"Current results add to evidence that emotional functioning is a critical domain of
heterogeneity in ADHD. Children with ADHD and an Irritable temperament profile appear to
reflect a moderately stable subgroup in the ADHD population with increased risk for negative
clinical outcomes. Results build the case for chronic irritability as a clinically-relevant trait
across multiple forms of psychopathology, and further highlight one approach to translating the
stability of measures of trait negative affect into categorical groupings for clinical application.
Together, work suggests that revision of psychiatric nosology based on neurobiologicallyinformed psychological dimensions as envisioned in RDoC (Cuthbert, 2014; Insel et al., 2010),
appears tractable. Inclusion of an ADHD specifier based on the presence or absence of irritability
warrants further examination. ",1

A retrospective clinical study on Psorinum therapy in
treating 245 participants with oral, lung, liver gallbladder,
pancreatic, and stomach cancers advocate in favor of this
alternative cancer treatment.24 An interview-based study
was conducted on 300 biopsy-proven cancer patients of
Psorinum therapy. The primary purpose of the study was to
ascertain the patients’ and/or their caregivers’ views on this
CAM therapy. The survey showed that the patients had tried
Psorinum therapy mainly due to no other available treatment options, financial constraints, frustration with the
conventional cancer treatments, and belief in the efficacy of
the Psorinum therapy. According to the survey, among the
300 patients with cancer, 195 (65%) had consulted their oncologists before trying the therapy.17 The limitation of this
study is that the effects of the implemented allopathic and
homeopathic supportive measures in the observed results
cannot be ruled out. However, the strength of the study lies
in the meticulous documentation of these 3 cases. This article
provides potential information for the health care professional who wishes to evaluate and integrate these therapies
into present patient-care protocols. It is imperative that this
potential be further evaluated and confirmed through welldesigned clinical trials. Equally important is the more thorough basic research in the future that will aim at elucidating
the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the drug
works against cancer.",1
"""VII. CONCLUSION
In this Article, we have investigated the imperfect
sources in QKD systems that implement the decoy state
protocol. By testing two intensity modulation methods,
we have found that the basic assumption about indistinguishability of signal and decoy states does not hold in
practice, especially in the case of laser diode pump current modulation. This pump-current modulation shows
timing mismatch between the signal and decoy states.
We have modeled a PNS attack based on the timing
mismatch that breaks the security of the QKD system.
To make the system robust against this loophole, we
have considered the distinguishability of signal and decoy
states in the security proof, and obtained two analytical
formulas to estimate the yield and error rate of the single
photon pulses. The result shows that the distinguishability would reduce the secure key rate. Fortunately, the
key rate under such imperfection can be improved by calibrating the transmittance of Bob’s unit. We have applied
this method to three implementations of the decoy state
protocol to estimate their secure key rate, which in some
cases has become reduced (also limiting the transmission
distance), and in some just zero.
The estimation of Y
µ
1
and e
µ
1 with the distinguishable
decoy state provides a method to guarantee the security of practical quantum cryptography systems. This
method could be employed as a standard tool to estimate the secure key rate, once the distinguishability in
the decoy state protocol is quantified in all degrees of
freedom. A conceptually similar evaluation method has
been proposed for the Trojan-horse attack [62]. Please
note that the key rate shown in this work is based on
prepare-and-measure QKD. For MDI QKD and the other
quantum cryptography systems, the secure key rate and
the other security properties under such imperfect source
model should be derived separately.""",1
"Conclusive remarks
The genome of Sm. propionica has not yet been available. A metagenome of candidate Sm. cisternae reconstructed from oil sands tailings that metabolize n-alkane did not predict the presence of biological electric connection (Qin et al., 2017). The genome of Syntrophomonas are also not known to encode the electric conductive system as found in Geobacter (Sieber et al., 2012). The unprecedented mechanisms for extracellular electron transfer (EET) however have begun to be revealed. Recently, a distinctive flavin-based EET pathway has been revealed in the Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes and the encoding genes appear widespread in anaerobes (Light et al., 2018). The methane-oxidizing Msr. acetivorans is thought to use membrane bound electron transfer machineries for Fe(III)-dependent CH4 oxidation (Yan et al., 2018b). Apparently, the organisms and mechanisms that operate EET can be more diverse than appreciated currently.

The dominant methanogens are closely related to Msa. concilii, Msr. barkeri and Mrg. formicica respectively. Both Msa. concilii and Msr. barkeri have been shown to perform DIET with Geobacter species (Morita et al., 2011; Rotaru et al., 2014a,b; Holmes et al., 2017). Albeit not growing on H2 or formate, the genomes of Msa. concilii and its relative Msa. harundinacea contain a complete set of genes coding for the required enzymes of CO2 reduction (Rotaru et al., 2014a; Holmes et al., 2017). The substrate-versatile Msr. barkeri contains genomic machinery for various pathways including CO2-reducing methanogenesis (Lovley, 2018). Though the involvement of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in DIET remains elusive, some electrochemical studies have indicated that they may accept electrons either directly or indirectly from cathodic electrodes (Lohner et al., 2014; Deutzmann et al., 2015).

Therefore, though the robust evidence has yet to be obtained, we speculated that DIET occurred in concert with H2/formate transfer in propionate oxidation in the presence of conductive materials nanoFe3O4 and CNTs. Further isolation of pure cultures and genomic investigations may shed lights on the mechanistic understanding. Given the widespread presence of conductive minerals in environments and the increasing application of conductive carbon materials, further researches should also pay an attention to the effects of these materials on the global CH4 and carbon cycling.",1
"In summary, we believe that the acute model of colitis in BALB/c mice may be useful in the study of normal mucosal healing and that the progression to chronicity observed in C57BL/6 mice offers a promising animal model for the pathological inflammatory changes observed in UC. Moreover, we are of the opinion that the chronic model is a powerful and convenient tool that can be used to validate future candidate treatments for IBD.",1
"Furthermore, the findings presented here are consistent with the idea that neighborhood conditions may have an important influence on the violent criminal behavior of youth in particular, and also with the idea that contemporaneous rather than lagged neighborhood conditions (particularly minority composition), i.e. situation neighborhood effects, may be the most important determinant of the neighborhood’s influence on violent behavior. Our analysis does not isolate the specific mechanisms through which neighborhood conditions might affect youth violence, but the exercise of tracking youth over the long term that we present here begins to narrow down the range of mechanisms that are consistent with the data. Our findings are also consistent with the optimistic view that even the criminal behavior of adolescents who have been exposed to distressed neighborhood conditions for extended periods may be sensitive to changes in the offending environment. The young people growing up in our nation’s distressed urban neighborhoods, even those who have already reached their peak offending ages, appear to be affected in important ways by their current situation.",1
"A similar conclusion was reached for the mbi1 mutant, in which we observed a substantial accumulation of the large PSII subunits, for example D2 (approximately 25% of WT; Figure 3b). Northern blot analysis (Figure S5) showed no defect in the RNA levels for the major PSII subunits. Protein pulse-labelling experiments with radioactive 35S-sulphate (Figure S6) showed normal translation of D1, D2 and CP43. Altogether, these data suggest that mbi1 is deficient in the production of a small PSII subunit.",1
"CONCLUSIONS
The concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate were rather low and decreased against the rise of L/S ratio with the exception of Zn at L/S ratio of 25. In the case of low L/S ratios, the concentrations of Pb and Zn were relatively high. A change in pH values led to different leaching patterns.

MSWI fly ash has strong acid buffering capability for containing large amounts of alkaline compounds. The concentrations of heavy metals declined along with the rise of initial pH of leaching solvent. When the pH value was greater than 6, the concentrations of heavy metals remained at a low level. The leaching characteristics of heavy metals could be well controlled through adjusting the pH in a desired range.

Chemical speciation and distribution of heavy metals varied greatly. Lead, Zn, Cu, and Cr were mainly present in the F3 to F5 so that their leachability could be well controlled in natural environment. However, reducing conditions could accelerated the leaching process of fly ash, bringing a greater risk to the landfill sites.",1
"Conclusions
HR was superior to RFA in the treatment of patients with small HCC eligible for surgical treatments, particularly for tumors > 3 cm. However, the findings have to be carefully interpreted due to the lower level of evidence. Further RCT are needed to define the exact value of HR and RFA for small HCC, even for tumors ≤ 3 cm.",1
"We conclude that origin single-stranded DNA releases Sld3 from Mcm2–7, allowing GINS to bind Mcm2–7.",1
"In conclusion, we replicate prior data15 in an independent sample by showing that DLPFC–hippocampus
functional connectivity during working memory is compromised in healthy first-degree relatives of SCZ patients.
This observation further corroborates the notion that
altered DLPFC–hippocampus coupling is indeed an
intermediate connectivity phenotype signaling a specific
neural system mechanism of the neurogenetic risk architecture of SCZ. We further extend prior knowledge by
showing that this phenotype appears to be rather specific
to SCZ genetic risk, and does not appear to reflect a trait
phenomenon linked to the genetic risk for psychosis in
general but to persistent cognitive impairment.",1
"In conclusion, our study for the first time enriched the cisplatin-resistant CRC cells with enhanced stem cell marker expression from sphere-forming and chemo-resistant SW480-derived tumor xenografts in immune-deficient mice, and miR-148a suppressed the expression of stem cell markers, increased chemo-sensitivity, cell invasion and migration at least partly via regulating WNT10b and β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, the down-regulation of miR-148a in CRC tissues was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival of patients with CRC, suggesting the important role of miR-148a in CRC progression.",1
