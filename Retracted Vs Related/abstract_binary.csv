"It has been suggested that drugs combining activities of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor agonist
may form a novel strategy for higher therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant. The present study aimed to examine the
pharmacology of YL-0919, a novel synthetic compound with combined high affinity and selectivity for serotonin transporter
and 5-HT1A receptors. We performed in vitro binding and function assays and in vivo behavioral tests to assess the
pharmacological properties and antidepressant-like efficacy of YL-0919. YL-0919 displayed high affinity in vitro to both 5-
HT1A receptor and 5-HT transporter prepared from rat cortical tissue. It exerted an inhibitory effect on forskolin-stimulated
cAMP formation and potently inhibited 5-HT uptake in both rat cortical synaptosomes and recombinant cells. After acute
p.o. administration, very low doses of YL-0919 reduced the immobility time in tail suspension test and forced swimming test
in mice and rats, with no significant effect on locomotor activity in open field test. Furthermore, WAY-100635 (a selective 5-
HT1A receptor antagonist, 0.3 mg/kg) significantly blocked the effect of YL-0919 in tail suspension test and forced swimming
test. In addition, chronic YL-0919 treatment significantly reversed the depressive-like behaviors in chronically stressed rats.
These findings suggest that YL-0919, a novel structure compound, exerts dual effect on the serotonergic system, as both 5-
HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT uptake blocker, showing remarkable antidepressant effects in animal models. Therefore, YL0919 may be used as a new option for the treatment of major depressive disorder.",0
"Background A negative impact of premature birth on health in adulthood is well established. However, it is not clear whether healthy adults who were born prematurely but have similar physical activity levels compared to adults born at term have a reduced maximal aerobic exercise capacity (maximum oxygen consumption [VO2max]). Objective We aimed to determine the efect of premature birth on aerobic exercise capacity and lung function in otherwise healthy, physically active individuals. Methods A broad literature search was conducted in the PubMed database. Search terms included ‘preterm/premature birth’ and ‘aerobic exercise capacity’. Maximal oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) was the main variable required for inclusion, and amongst those investigations forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, % predicted) was evaluated as a secondary parameter. For the systematic review, 29 eligible articles were identifed. Importantly, for the meta-analysis, only studies which reported similar activity levels between healthy controls and the preterm group/s were included, resulting in 11 articles for the VO2max analysis (total n=688, n=333 preterm and n=355 controls) and six articles for the FEV1 analysis (total n=296, n=147 preterm and n=149 controls). Data were analysed using Review Manager ( Review Manager. RevMan version 5.4 software. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2020.). Results The systematic review highlighted the broad biological impact of premature birth. While the current literature tends to suggest that there may be a negative impact of premature birth on both VO2max and FEV1, several studies did not control for the potential infuence of difering physical activity levels between study groups, thus justifying a focused meta-analysis of selected studies. Our meta-analysis strongly suggests that prematurely born humans who are otherwise healthy do have a reduced VO2max efect: Z=5.32) and FEV1 (mean diference−9.22 [95% confdence interval−13.54,−4.89] % predicted, p<0.0001, test
for overall efect: Z=4.18) independent of physical activity levels.
Conclusions Whilst the current literature contains mixed fndings on the efects of premature birth on VO2max and FEV1,
our focused meta-analysis suggests that even when physical activity levels are similar, there is a clear reduction in VO2max
and FEV1 in adults born prematurely. Therefore, future studies should carefully investigate the underlying determinants of
the reduced VO2max and FEV1 in humans born preterm, and develop strategies to improve their maximal aerobic capacity
and lung function beyond physical activity interventions.",0
"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of people's lives, with many tasks and services now being delivered online in the aim of reducing contact and preventing further transmission of the disease. This has resulted in the increase in the use of portable electronic devices (i.e., mobile phones, smartphones, laptops), which emit different frequencies of electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation. However, the evidence on the harmful impacts of EMF radiation exposure on the human body, particularly on the abdomen of the female body during pregnancy, is scarce. Further, the related studies in the literature have yet to be systematically reviewed. If unmanaged, the absorption of EMF radiation by the maternal abdomen during pregnancy is associated with serious birth and infant outcomes.",0
"Learning to write involves integrating motor production and visual perception to develop orthographic representations. This study tries to test the effect of hand movement training as a pathway to neural correlates for L2 Chinese and L2 English readers. Twenty L2 Chinese and 20 L2 English (n = 20) adults participated in both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments. We designed six learning conditions: Hand Writing Chinese (HC), Viewing Chinese (VC), Drawing followed by Character Recognition in Chinese (DC), Hand Writing English (HE), Viewing English (VE), and Drawing followed by Word Recognition in English (DE). Behavioral and EEG results demonstrated that drawing facilitated visual word recognition in Chinese compared to viewing. The findings imply that hand movement could strengthen the neural processing and improve behavioral performance in Chinese character recognition for L2 Chinese learners and English word recognition for L2 Chinese learners. Furthermore, N170 amplitude at the drawing condition was positively correlated with N400 amplitudes. Thus, the early visual word recognition neural indicator (e.g., N170) was predictive of the late neural indicator of semantic processing (e.g., N400), suggesting that hand movement facilitates the neural correlates between early word recognition and later comprehension.",0
"To study the effect of miRNA‐200b on hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 in mice.
The C59BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups (normal control
[NC], CCLR model [Model], and CCl4 + miRNA‐200b [miRNA]). The hepatic
fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injected subcutaneously twice per week in Model
and miRNA groups. After 6 weeks building model, the mice of miRNA group
were injected the miRNA‐200b from caudal vein twice per week. The mice of
Model and miRNA groups were continuously fed for 3 weeks. The IL‐1β, IL‐6,
and TNF‐α concentrations of serum were measured by enzyme‐linked
immunosorbent assay. The hepatic tissues of difference groups were observed
by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, sirius red staining, Masson staining,
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and
measured toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) proteins
expressions by western blot assay. The correlation between miRNA‐200b and
TLR4 were analyzed by dual luciferase target assay. Compared with NC group,
the interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), IL‐6, and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α)
concentrations of Model group were significantly upregulated (P < 0.05,
respectively). With miRNA‐200b overexpression, the IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐α
concentrations were significantly suppressed (P < 0.05, respectively). The
pathologies were improved by H&E staining, sirius red staining, and Masson
staining; meanwhile, the hepatic cell apoptosis rate was significantly suppressed
(P < 0.05). The TLR4 and NF‐κB protein expressions of miRNA group were
significantly suppressed compared with the Model group (P < 0.05, respectively). By dual luciferase target assay, the TLR4 was a target gene of miRNA‐
200b. The miRNA‐200b upregulation improved hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4
via regulation of TLR4 in vivo",0
"Background
Smoking is widespread at all ages in Saudi society. In addition, complaints of vertigo are common. A key problem is how smoking affects vertigo and, thus, quality of life. Researchers have investigated the association between smoking and vertigo and found that smoking may be a risk factor for vertigo, but this association is not clear. The current study aims to investigate the association between smoking and vertigo.
Materials and methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study from March 2022 to January 2023 to investigate the effect of smoking on vertigo in Saudi Arabia’s adult population.
Results
We found that smokers were more prone to vertigo than non-smokers. In addition, the severity of vertigo increases as the number of cigarettes smoked or the length of time in years that the person has smoked increases.
Conclusion
The findings of the study should inspire more research into the impact of demographic factors on vertigo among smokers.",0

The long-term use of calcium hydroxide, or Ca(OH)2, on dentin has been established in the literature. However, scarce data is available on dentin wettability with Ca(OH)2.
Aim
The present study was conducted to assess the outcomes of Ca(OH)2 use on the wettability of dentin following two and four weeks of using sealers of bioceramic (BC) and Tubli-Seal™ in the root canal.
Methods
In this study, 168 specimens were divided into 12 groups of 14 specimens each and were numbered from G1 to G12. G1-G6 groups were tested with Tubli-Seal. Sterile water irrigation was reserved for G1 for two weeks (14 days) followed by two minutes treatment with 6% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) chemical irrigation and 17% EDTA (10 ml). G2 and G3 were subjected to Ca(OH)2 (0.1 ml of UltraCal) for two weeks followed by 10ml sterile water irrigation for two minutes with chemical irrigation. G4 to G6 were given similar treatment for four weeks. G7-G12 were assessed for BC sealer similarly to G1-G6. Two and four weeks of incubation with sterile water or Ca(OH)2 was done in 100% humidity at 37°C. SEM and EDX were done to evaluate the surface morphology of G1 and G6, and results were formed. 
Results
Significantly smaller contact angles were seen for Tubli-Seal (G1 to G6) compared to BC (G7 to G12) with p
Conclusion
Better dentin wettability is seen with Tubli-seal compared to BC sealer. A smaller contact angle between root canal sealers and dentin is seen in the remaining calcium hydroxide samples. Also, calcium hydroxide can be removed from the polished dentin surface with two minutes of irrigation with 17% EDTA and 6% NaOCl.

"Background Pharmacotherapy provides an option for adults with overweight and obesity to reduce their bodyweight if
lifestyle modifications fail. We summarised the latest evidence for the benefits and harms of weight-lowering drugs.
Methods This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane
Library (CENTRAL) from inception to March 23, 2021, for randomised controlled trials of weight-lowering drugs in
adults with overweight and obesity. We performed frequentist random-effect network meta-analyses to summarise
the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation frameworks
to rate the certainty of evidence, calculate the absolute effects, categorise interventions, and present the findings. The
study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021245678.
Findings 14 605 citations were identified by our search, of which 143 eligible trials enrolled 49 810 participants. Except
for levocarnitine, all drugs lowered bodyweight compared with lifestyle modification alone; all subsequent numbers
refer to comparisons with lifestyle modification. High to moderate certainty evidence established phentermine–
topiramate as the most effective in lowering weight (odds ratio [OR] of ≥5% weight reduction 8·02, 95% CI

"T
he overall effects of electronic cigarettes (ECs) on public health remain disputed, with concerns about EC use
in young people in contrast with the potential of ECs to
help adult smokers quit.1,2 Regarding the function of ECs as
an aid to stopping smoking, ECs can be seen as a form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) that is achieving a wider reach
than traditional NRT products, such as nicotine chewing gum
and nicotine patches. In countrieswhere ECs and NRT are available, smokers tend to use ECs for smoking cessation more
widely.3,4Apart from the wider reach, ameta-analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials of ECs vs NRT conducted to date concluded that ECs were also more effective than NRT, although
further trials are needed.5
Next to NRT, the most extensively tested and most widely
used pharmacological aid to stopping smoking is a partial agonist for α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, varenicline,
which is also more effective than NRT.6 One study compared
varenicline on its own with varenicline combined with ECs, but
the trial was stopped early when only 46 participants were recruited in each study arm, meaning that the study was underpowered to detect a difference.7 To our knowledge, no study
to date has attempted a direct comparison between ECs and
varenicline.
In this article, we report a randomized clinical trial that
compared ECs and varenicline. The trial also included an NRT
arm. The trial was testing whether ECs are superior to NRT and
noninferior to varenicline. The study was conducted in China,
where access to and use of stop-smoking medications, as well
as ECs, are much lower than inWestern countries.8-12This had
the potential advantages of lower expectancy effects and reduced risk of trial arms contamination via use of nonallocated products, an issue that affected a recent UK trial of ECs
vs NRT as treatments for pregnant smokers.1",0
"Digital transformation and green innovation are powerful initiatives to achieve carbon peaking,
carbon neutrality targets and highquality economic development. Using a sample of high energy
consuming listed enterprises from 2012 to 2021, a double fxedefect model is constructed to
verify the efect of green innovation on the carbon emission reduction performance of high energy
consuming enterprises, and digital transformation is used as a moderating variable to analyze the
inner mechanism of green innovation afecting the carbon emission reduction performance of high
energyconsuming enterprises under the efect of digital transformation. The empirical results show
that green innovation can signifcantly improve the carbon emission reduction performance of
energyconsuming enterprises, while digital transformation positively moderates the efect of green
innovation on the carbon emission reduction performance of energyconsuming enterprises. When
considering the industry heterogeneity, the moderation efect of digital transformation is signifcant
in the chemical raw materials and chemical products manufacturing industry and the electricity
and heat production and supply industry, but the petroleum processing and coking and nuclear fuel
processing industry, the nonmetallic mineral products industry, the ferrous metal smelting and rolling
processing industry and the nonferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry are not yet
signifcantly afected by green innovation and digital transformation. The fndings of the study provide
empirical evidence to promote the improvement of carbon emission reduction performance of energy

At the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2020, China solemnly announced that China
would strive to reach peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Te ""double carbon"" target refects
China’s determination to comprehensively implement the concept of green development and promote ecological
civilization1
. Te core of green and low-carbon development is to update and optimise products, processes and
services in line with environmental needs, with a view to allocating and utilising resources efciently, reducing
the damage caused by carbon emissions to the environment and ecology, and providing strong support for China
to achieve the ""double carbon"" target and promote high-quality economic development. What is particularly
noteworthy is that with the acceleration of the new round of technological revolution and industrial change,
digital transformation has become a core driver of new development momentum, an important means to facilitate and promote green development, and a necessary way to achieve the ""double carbon"" target. As the basic
industry of our country, the high energy-consuming industry has made great contribution to the construction
of our country’s industry and infrastructure. But at the same time, it also brings environmental problems that
cannot be ignored. Te most prominent one is ""high pollution, high energy consumption and high material
consumption""2
. Existing research has found that the output value of China’s high-energy-consuming industries
is less than 1/3 of the total industrial output value, but energy consumption, material consumption and waste
emissions account for more than 1/2 of the total industrial emissions3

"Osteosarcopenia, a combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia, is a common condition among older adults. While numerous studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on the treatment of osteoporosis, the pharmacological treatment of osteosarcopenia still lacks evidence. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody, has shown encouraging results for the treatment of osteosarcopenia. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the potential dual role of denosumab as an anti-resorptive agent and for other beneficial muscle-related effects in patients with osteosarcopenia, and to evaluate whether denosumab can be a treatment of choice compared to bisphosphonate.


Methods
 Relevant literature was collated from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The primary outcome was denosumab’s effect on lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD), handgrip strength, and gait speed change. The secondary outcome was the effect of denosumab on appendicular lean mass (ALM). The outcomes were presented as mean difference (MD). A random effects model was used in the analysis to represent the population. The risk of bias was assessed using funnel plots.


Results
 Out of the 3,074 studies found, four full-text studies met the inclusion criteria, including 264 and 244 participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Regarding a primary outcome, our meta-analysis showed that denosumab showed no significant differences in LS BMD and gait speed changes compared to other agents—MD=0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.35 to 0.79; p=0.09 and MD=0.11; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.40; p=0.46, respectively. Denosumab had a significant effect on handgrip strength change compared to standard agents—MD=5.16; 95% CI, 1.38 to 18.94; p=0.007, based on the random effects model.


Conclusions
Denosumab was better than bisphosphonate and placebo in improving muscle strength (handgrip strength). Therefore, denosumab may be favored in individuals with osteosarcopenia to improve muscular performance and reduce fall risk.

METHODS: Using an observational cohort design, the US National Inpatient Sample (2018–2020) was queried for adult
patients with basilar artery occlusion and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) <10 for patients treated with
thrombectomy versus medical management. The primary outcome of routine discharge (to home or self-care) was evaluated
using multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching, adjusted for baseline characteristics, stroke severity,
and treatment with thrombolysis.
RESULTS: Of 17019 with basilar artery occlusion, 5795 patients met the criteria for inclusion criteria for our study, and
880 (15.4%) were treated with endovascular thrombectomy. In the propensity score–matched cohort, 880 patients were
treated with medical management and endovascular thrombectomy, respectively. In multivariable regression, endovascular
thrombectomy was associated with both an increased odds of routine discharge (odds ratio, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.31–2.90];
P=0.001) and a decreased length of hospital stay (B, −0.74 [95% CI, −1.36 to −0.11]; P=0.02) compared with medical
management. In the propensity score matched cohort, endovascular thrombectomy remained associated with greater odds
of routine discharge (2.01 [95% CI, 1.21–3.34]; P=0.007) but no difference in length of hospital stay (B, −0.22 [95% CI,
−0.90 to 0.46]; P=0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine discharge was more common in this representative US cohort of patients with basilar artery occlusion
and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <10 who underwent thrombectomy compared to conventional medical
management. These findings suggest thrombectomy may be associated with better functional outcomes despite lower
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and should be validated in a clinical trial setting.

"Background Dementia and hearing loss are both highly prevalent conditions among older adults. We aimed to
examine the association between hearing aid use and risk of all-cause and cause-specific dementia among middleaged and older-aged adults, and to explore the roles of mediators and moderators in their association.
Methods We used data from the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort study, which recruited adults aged 40–69 years
between 2006 and 2010 across 22 centres in England, Scotland, and Wales. We used Cox proportional hazards models
to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs between self-reported hearing aid use status (hearing loss with or
without hearing aids) at baseline and risk of dementia (all-cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia,
and non-Alzheimer’s disease non-vascular dementia). Dementia diagnoses were ascertained using hospital records
and death-register data. We also analysed the roles of mediators (self-reported social isolation, loneliness, and mood)
and moderators (self-reported education and income, smoking, morbidity, and measured APOE allele status).
Findings After the exclusion of people who did not answer the question on hearing difficulties (n=25081 [5·0%]) and
those with dementia at baseline visit (n=283 [0·1%]), we included 437 704 people in the analyses. Compared with
participants without hearing loss, people with hearing loss without hearing aids had an increased risk of all-cause
dementia (HR 1·42 [95% CI 1·29–1·57]); we found no increased risk in people with hearing loss with hearing
aids (1·04 [0·98–1·10]). The positive association of hearing aid use was observed in all-cause dementia and causespecific dementia subtypes (Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and non-Alzheimer’s disease non-vascular
dementia). The attributable risk proportion of dementia for hearing loss was estimated to be 29·1%. Of the total
association between hearing aid use and all-cause dementia, 1·5% was mediated by reducing social isolation, 2·3% by
reducing loneliness, and 7·1% by reducing depressed mood.
Interpretation In people with hearing loss, hearing aid use is associated with a risk of dementia of a similar level to
that of people without hearing loss. With the postulation that up to 8% of dementia cases could be prevented with
proper hearing loss management, our findings highlight the urgent need to take measures to address hearing loss to
improve cognitive decline.

"Differentiating primary and secondary membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) using
biomarkers for MGN is essential in patients’ diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Although biopsy
has been the primary tool in making the diagnosis, not all patients can withstand it due to its invasive
nature, and it cannot be used to monitor treatment. Hence, there is the need for less invasive or even
non-invasive biomarkers for effective diagnosis, treatment monitoring and prognostication. This
study aimed at providing an alternative way of differentiating primary and secondary MGN using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique for serum and urine biomarkers (M-type
phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A))

"Background: Lesotho has the second-highest HIV prevalence globally at an estimated 23%, with approximately 87% of the
population between 15 and 59 years of age reported to be receiving antiretroviral treatment. There is an urgent need to increase
access to effective ART due to increasing rates of first- and second-line treatment failure. Sustaining successful treatment and limiting
the development of virological failure is essential, hence the need for early detection of increased viral load indicating drug resistance
or rapid progression of viral replication.
Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the proportion of patients with HIV with virological failure and to identify factors
associated with virological failure in two districts of Lesotho.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two districts (Butha-Buthe and Mokhotlong) in Lesotho. Data for all patients
(age ≥15 years) in the viral load (VL) monitoring database with at least two consecutive viral load results between December 2015 and
December 2019 from 22 health facilities were extracted. Descriptive data were presented using tables and figures. Bivariate and
multivariate analyses were performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant association.
Results: Only 4% (n = 913) of the study participants had virological failure. Longer time on treatment >65 months (AOR: 1.85 CI:
1.59–2.15) and being on second-line ART regimen (AOR: 75.23 95% CI: 75.00–99.15) were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with
virological failure.
Conclusion: Virological failure among the study participants is lower compared to other settings. The study identified duration on
treatment, treatment regimen as high risk for virological failure. Targeted interventions should be developed for these high-risk group
individuals, with continuous monitoring of virological response and appropriate drug switching to clients to achieve improved
outcomes.

"OBJECTIVE
To determine changes in household purchases
of drinks and confectionery one year after
implementation of the UK soft drinks industry levy
(SDIL).
DESIGN
Controlled interrupted time series analysis.
PARTICIPANTS
Members of a panel of households reporting their
purchasing on a weekly basis to a market research
company (average weekly number of participants
n=22183), March 2014 to March 2019.
INTERVENTION
A two tiered tax levied on manufacturers of soft drinks,
announced in March 2016 and implemented in April
2018. Drinks with ≥8 g sugar/100 mL (high tier) are
taxed at £0.24/L and drinks with ≥5 to <8 g sugar/100
mL (low tier) are taxed at £0.18/L. Drinks with <5 g
sugar/100 mL (no levy) are not taxed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Absolute and relative differences in the volume of,
and amount of sugar in, soft drinks categories, all
soft drinks combined, alcohol, and confectionery
purchased per household per week one year after
implementation of the SDIL compared with trends
before the announcement of the SDIL.
RESULTS
In March 2019, compared with the counterfactual
estimated from pre-announcement trends, purchased
volume of drinks in the high levy tier decreased by
155 mL (95% confidence interval 240.5 to 69.5 mL)
per household per week, equivalent to 44.3% (95%
confidence interval 59.9% to 28.7%), and sugar
purchased in these drinks decreased by 18.0 g (95%
confidence interval 32.3 to 3.6 g), or 45.9% (68.8%

"Effect of imatinib on rats with spinal cord injury (SCI)
was investigated through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway.
Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into
sham operation group (n=12), model group (n=12), imatinib
group (n=12) and inhibitor group (n=12). The results of
immunohistochemistry showed that in comparison with sham
operation group, the other three groups had overtly increased
positive expression level of Bax and evidently reduced positive
expression level of Bcl-2 (P<0.05). Compared with those in
model group and inhibitor group, the positive expression level
of Bax was distinctly lower, while that of Bcl-2 was notably
increased in imatinib group (P<0.05). According to western
blot analysis, the protein expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1
were obviously higher in the other three groups than those
in sham operation group (P<0.05), and they were remarkably higher in imatinib group than those in model group and
inhibitor group (P<0.05). The results of qPCR assay revealed
that the Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA expression levels were markedly elevated in the other three groups compared with those
in sham operation group (P<0.05). Based on ELISA, the
other three groups exhibited notably raised content of IL-6,
TNF-α, ROS and SOD compared with sham operation group
(P<0.05), and imatinib group displayed remarkably decreased
content of IL-6, TNF-α and ROS and markedly elevated SOD
content in comparison with model group and inhibitor group
(P<0.05). The results of TUNEL assay demonstrated that the
rate of apoptosis was significantly raised in the other three
groups compared with that in sham operation group (P<0.05),
and it declined obviously in imatinib group compared with
that in model group and inhibitor group (P<0.05). Imatinib
inhibits oxidative stress response in SCI rats by activating the
Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus repressing apoptosis and

"Violence against children can cause psychological problems such as post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD). The negative impact of violence on children is psychological and physical
problems and risk of suicide. Nurses have a role to provide comprehensive nursing care such as
cognitive behavior therapy for reducing PTSD symptoms. The purpose of this study was to describe
the methods of cognitive behavior therapy to reduce symptoms of PTSD in children who are victims
of violence. This study used the scoping review method. The databases use for the literature review
in this study were CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus. The keywords used in English were “cognitive
behavioral therapy OR CBT” AND “violence OR abuse” AND “post-traumatic stress disorder OR
PTSD” AND “child OR children”. The inclusion criteria were full text, randomized control trial or
quasi-experimental research design, English language, the sample was children, and the publication
period was for the last 10 years (2013–2022). We found 10 articles discussing CBT intervention on
children who experienced victim abuse to reduce symptoms of PTSD. Most of the articles in this
study used randomized control trial design. Several samples in this study are from the USA. The total
sample was 47–320 respondents. This study showed three methods of CBT, namely psychoeducation,
self-management, and coping strategies. CBT interventions can be carried out face-to-face or online.
The activities carried out by the participants were relaxing, participating in training, counseling,
problem-solving discussions, and therapy to improve sleep quality. Cognitive behavioral therapy is
an intervention that can be carried out to reduce the traumatic impact on child victims of violence by
taking into account the characteristics and development of the children.",0
"Background
Neuroinflammation causes neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Ipriflavone (IP), therapeutic compound to postmenopausal osteoporosis, has limited estrogenic activity and is accounted as AChE inhibitor. The developing of drug delivery systems
to enable drug targeting to specific sites increases the drug therapeutic effect.
Objective
The aim of the present study was to formulate and evaluate ipriflavone loaded albumin
nanoparticles (IP-Np) along with free ipriflavone against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced
neuroinflammation in rats.
Methods
Neuroinflammation was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p) injection of LPS (250 μg/kg rat body
weight) then treatments were conducted with (1) ipriflavone at two doses 50 mg/kg and 5
mg/kg, (2) IP-Np (5 mg ipriflavone/kg) or (3) IP-Np coated with polysorbate 80 (IP-Np-T80)
(5 mg ipriflavone/kg). The alteration of the inflammatory response in male adult Wistar rats’
brain hippocampus was investigated by examining associated indices using biochemical
and molecular analyses.
Results
A significant upsurge in inflammatory mediators and decline in antioxidant status were
observed in LPS-induced rats. In one hand, ipriflavone (50 mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80
ameliorated LPS induced brain hippocampal inflammation where they depreciated the level

"Mitochondrial genome provides useful information about species concerning its evolution and
phylogenetics. We have taken the advantage of high throughput nextgeneration sequencing
technique to sequence the complete mitogenome of Yellowbilled babbler (Turdoides afnis), a
species endemic to Peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Both, referencebased and denovo assemblies
of mitogenome were performed and observed that denovo assembled mitogenome was most
appropriate. The complete mitogenome of yellowbilled babbler (assembled denovo) was 17,672 bp
in length with 53.2% AT composition. Thirteen proteincoding genes along with two rRNAs and
22 tRNAs were detected. The arrangement pattern of these genes was found conserved among
Leiothrichidae family mitogenomes. Duplicated control regions were found in the newly sequenced
mitogenome. Downstream bioinformatics analysis revealed the efect of translational efciency and
purifying selection pressure over thirteen proteincoding genes in yellowbilled babbler mitogenome.
Ka/Ks analysis indicated the highest synonymous substitution rate in the nad6 gene. Evolutionary
analysis revealed the conserved nature of all the proteincoding genes across Leiothrichidae family
mitogenomes. Our limited phylogeny results placed T. afnis in a separate group, a sister group of
Garrulax. Overall, our results provide a useful information for future studies on the evolutionary and
adaptive mechanisms of birds belong to the Leiothrichidae family.",0
"Hepatitis causes hepatic cell injury, regeneration and different levels of fibrogenesis, and severe liver fibrogenesis progresses into cirrhosis with liver dysfunction. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein that is predominantly secreted by hepatocytes during early injury or infection. Nevertheless, the relationship of SAA and development of cirrhosis as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms is largely unknown. Here, we found that macrophages are the major SAA-binding cells in the injured liver.
in vitro
, macrophages treated with SAA exhibited high production of IL-10 but low production of IL-12, as features for M2 macrophages. Moreover, these polarized M2 macrophages by SAA also produced IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa, characteristics for an M2b subtype, rather than an alternative M2a or fibrogenic M2c subtype. In a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl
4
)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis/cirrhosis, anti-SAA sera were used to block the effects of SAA, resulting in increases in the severity of hepatic fibrosis, suggesting an overall anti-fibrogenic effect of SAA. Isolated macrophages from mouse liver showed that anti-SAA appeared to alter the polarization of macrophages from M2b to M2c, suggesting that SAA may induce M2b-like macrophage polarization during liver inflammation, which prevents the liver from fibrogenesis.

The forward and reverse Tab primer sequences are reverse to each other at their 5’ end (Nr and N), whereas their 3’ end sequences are complementary to their respective target nucleic acid sequences. The PSR method was performed at a constant temperature 61 °C–65 °C, yielding a complicated spiral structure. PSR assay was monitored continuously in a real-time turbidimeter instrument or visually detected with the aid of a fluorescent dye (SYBR Greenı), and could be finished within 1 h with a high accumulation of 10

"Peptic ulcer including gastric and duodenal ulcers is a common gastro-intestinal disorder worldwide, associated with a significant
mortality due to bleeding and perforation. Numerous efforts are being exerted to look for natural drugs that lack the potential side
effects but still keep beneficial effects for treatment and/or prevention of gastric ulcer. Pinocembrin (PINO) is a natural flavonoid
retaining anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was conducted to investigate the
protective and therapeutic effects of PINO against indomethacin (INDO)-induced gastric ulcer in rats and the possible underlying
mechanisms. PINO (25 and 50 mg/kg) promoted mucus secretion, decreased ulcer index, and inhibited histopathological changes
induced by INDO. Further investigation of possible mechanisms showed that PINO significantly attenuated INDO-induced
oxidative and inflammatory responses in both doses when administrated before or after ulcer induction. PINO downregulated
mRNA expression level of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) which subsequently inhibited NF-κB activation
and inflammatory cytokine release including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). Additionally,
PINO inhibited apoptotic activity which was confirmed by downregulation of caspase-3 transcription. The current results
demonstrated the promising therapeutic activity of PINO against INDO-induced gastric ulcer due to—at least partly—its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects.

"Purpose Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with regulatory approval in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and refractory diferentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors like sorafenib may cause proteinuria. This study aimed to analyze the efectiveness and safety
of sorafenib in RCC, HCC and DTC patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Methods This retrospective study analyzed integrated data from prospective post-marketing surveillance studies for advanced
RCC, HCC and DTC. Background factors considered to afect patients’ prognosis were balanced by propensity score matching using eGFR cut-of values of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
.
Results In the combined matched population (N=2430), sorafenib was equally efective in patients with lower and higher
eGFR values. Sorafenib had an overall response rate (ORR: complete+partial responses) of 18.9% and a disease control
rate (DCR: complete+partial responses+stable disease) of 67.0%. There were no signifcant diferences between lower
and higher eGFR groups for response rates. Renal function was maintained throughout the 12-month study period in the
combined population and in each indication. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were reported in 91.6% and 58.2% of
propensity score-matched patients, and with no signifcant diferences between lower and higher eGFR groups.
Conclusion The efectiveness and safety of sorafenib were similar in patients with eGFR<60 and≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2
during the 12-month observation period, and without impairing renal function.

"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a glycosylated cell surface receptor for high density lipoproteins (HDL), oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL), and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPLs). Scarb1 is expressed in macrophages and has been shown to have both pro- and anti-atherogenic properties. It has been reported that global deletion of Scarb1 in mice leads to either high or low bone mass and that PC-OxPLs decrease osteoblastogenesis and increase osteoclastogenesis. PC-OxPLs decrease bone mass in 6-month-old mice and are critical pathogenetic factors in the bone loss caused by high fat diet or aging. We have investigated here whether Scarb1 expression in myeloid cells affects bone mass and whether PC-OxPLs exert their anti-osteogenic effects via activation of Scarb1 in macrophages. To this end, we generated mice with deletion of Scarb1 in LysM-Cre expressing cells and found that lack of Scarb1 did not affect bone mass in vivo. These results indicate that Scarb1 expression in cells of the myeloid/osteoclast lineage does not contribute to bone homeostasis. Based on this evidence, and earlier studies of ours showing that Scarb1 expression in osteoblasts does not affect bone mass, we conclude that Scarb1 is not an important mediator of the adverse effects on PC-OxPLs in osteoclasts or osteoblasts in 6-month-old mice.

"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a cell surface receptor for
high density lipoproteins. It also binds oxidized low density lipoproteins and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPL), which adversely affect bone homeostasis. Overexpression of a single chain form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 IgM–a
natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPL–increases trabecular and cortical bone mass in
female and male mice by stimulating bone formation. We have previously reported that
Scarb1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for PC-OxPL in calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells. Additionally, bone marrow- and calvaria-derived osteoblasts from Scarb1
knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating
effects of OxPL. Previous skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice has produced contradictory
results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass but another study reporting low
bone mass. To clarify the role of Scarb1 in osteoblasts, we deleted Scarb1 specifically in
cells of the osteoblast lineage using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. We observed no difference
in bone mineral density measured by DXA in either female or male Osx1-Cre;Scarb1fl/fl
mice compared to wild type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. Additionally,
microCT analysis of 6-month-old females and 7-month-old males did not detect any difference in trabecular or cortical bone mass between genotypes. These results indicate that
expression of Scarb1 in cells of the osteoblast lineage does not play an important role in
bone homeostasis and, therefore, it is not essential for the effects of PC-OxPL on these
cells.",0
"Introduction: The potential teratogenic risk of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is
of widespread concern; however, related evidence is largely absent in humans. This
study aimed to compare the prevalence of congenital malformations between pregnant women with and without TCM exposure.
Material and methods: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study of 17 713
women who participated in a survey on periconceptional TCM exposure. Primary outcome was congenital malformations diagnosed from a survey conducted on the day
42 after delivery.
Results: A total of 16 751 pregnant women with 273 congenital malformations were
included in the analysis. Fetuses exposed to TCM had an increased risk of congenital
malformations compared to those without exposure (odds ratio [OR] 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–4.02) after controlling for potential confounders. There were
significant associations with congenital malformations in women with early pregnant
exposure (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.00–4.20) and for those who received ≥2 TCM formulas
(OR 5.84, 95% CI 1.44–23.65). Pre-pregnancy TCM exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects (OR 12.69; 95% CI 3.01–53.51).
Conclusions: Periconceptional TCM exposure is associated with an increased risk of
congenital malformation. This effect was cumulative and sensitive to periconceptional
age. Therefore, TCM deserves more attention and should be used cautiously for pregnant women and those trying to become pregnant.

"Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and
trigger transcriptional regulation of genes important for islet response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile
Ca2+-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from
human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular Ca2+ signalling, while preserving biological
heterogeneity.
Methods We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mmol/l glucose; (2) 16 mmol/l
glucose and 40 mmol/l KCl to maximally stimulate Ca2+ signalling; and (3) 16 mmol/l glucose, 40 mmol/l KCl and 5 mmol/l
EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) to inhibit Ca2+ signalling, for 1 h. We sequenced 68,650 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted
the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 59,373 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed Ca2+-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each
endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.
Results Based on the number of Ca2+-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of
Ca2+ response. We also showed that polyhormonal clusters expressing both INS and GCG, or both INS and SST, are defined by
Ca2+-regulated genes specific to each cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the
highest number of Ca2+-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucosestimulated insulin secretory function.
Conclusions/interpretation Here we use our large-scale, multi-condition, single-cell dataset to show that human islets have celltype-specific Ca2+-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify
PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of Ca2+-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory
function.

"Background: Most studies addressing non-operative management for acute appendicitis have focused on adults, and there are limited data available for children. We aimed to evaluate the results of successful non-operative management in children with acute uncomplicated appendicitis with our “additional criteria” and find which factors could be affecting the success rate and which cases could be candidates for non-operative management.
        Materials and methods: A total of 54 patients who were diagnosed with acute uncomplicated appendicitis and received non-operative management were re-evaluated retrospectively. Defining uncomplicated appendicitis was based on the duration of symptoms (<24 hours), clinical history, and radiologic findings. The radiologic evaluation was based on ultrasonography and computed tomography. The patients received an intravenous antibiotic combination (sulbactam/ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin) for five days at the hospital; the treatment was completed after 10 days with an oral antibiotic combination (amoxicillin/clavulanate, metronidazole). The cases have a follow-up period of up to two years.
        Results: The mean patient age and follow-up time were 13.0 ± 4 years and 41.6 ± 13 months, respectively. The mean leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and appendix diameter values were 15.48 ± 6.4 × 109/L, 11.79 ± 24.5 mg/dL, and 7.76 ± 1.4 mm on admission, and 6.86 ± 12.4 × 109/L, 4.17 ± 10.3 mg/dL, and 5.82 ± 1.6 mm on the second day, respectively. This decrease in WBC/CRP values and appendix diameter was statistically significant (p < 0.001). None of the patients had an early failure, complication, or adverse event. Recurrent appendicitis occurred in only five cases (9%) that were treated by laparoscopic appendectomy during the follow-up.
        Conclusion: Non-operative management for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children regarding long-term outcomes with our criteria was satisfactory and initial success rates were excellent.

"Motivation: CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been revolutionizing the field of gene editing in recent years. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) enable Cas9 proteins to target specific genomic loci for editing. However, editing efficiency varies between gRNAs. Thus, computational methods were developed to predict editing efficiency for any gRNA of interest. Highthroughput datasets of Cas9 editing efficiencies were produced to train machine-learning models to predict editing efficiency. However, these high-throughput datasets have low correlation with functional and endogenous editing. Another difficulty arises from the fact that functional and endogenous editing efficiency is more difficult to measure, and as a result, functional and endogenous datasets are too small to train accurate machine-learning models on. Results: We developed DeepCRISTL, a deep-learning model to predict the on-target efficiency given a gRNA sequence. DeepCRISTL takes advantage of high-throughput datasets to learn general patterns of gRNA on-target editing efficiency, and then uses transfer learning (TL) to fine-tune the model and fit it to the functional and endogenous prediction task. We pre-trained the DeepCRISTL model on more than 150 000 gRNAs, produced through the DeepHF study as a high-throughput dataset of three Cas9 enzymes. We improved the DeepHF model by multi-task and ensemble techniques and achieved state-of-the-art results over each of the three enzymes: up to 0.89 in Spearman correlation between predicted and measured on-target efficiencies. To fine-tune model weights to predict on-target efficiency of functional or endogenous datasets, we tested several TL approaches, with gradual learning being the overall best performer, both when pre-trained on DeepHF and when pre-trained on CRISPROn, another highthroughput dataset. DeepCRISTL outperformed state-of-the-art methods on all functional and endogenous datasets. Using saliency maps, we identified and compared the important features learned by the model in each dataset. We believe DeepCRISTL will improve prediction performance in many other CRISPR/Cas9 editing contexts by leveraging TL to utilize both high-throughput datasets, and smaller and more biologically relevant datasets, such as functional and endogenous datasets. Availability and implementation: DeepCRISTL is available via github.com/OrensteinLab/DeepCRISTL.

" The allogeneic transplantation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) derived from somatic cells overcomes the limitation of avian cloning. Here, we transdifferentiate chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) from black feathered Langshan chickens to PGCs and transplant them into White Plymouth Rock chicken embryos to produce viable offspring with characteristics inherited from the donor. We express Oct4/Sox2/Nanog/Lin28A (OSNL) to reprogram CEFs to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are further induced to differentiate into PGCs by BMP4/BMP8b/EGF. DNA demethylation, histone acetylation and glycolytic activation elevate the iPSC induction efficiency, while histone acetylation and glycolytic inhibition facilitate PGCs formation. The induced PGCs (iPGCs) are transplanted into the recipients, which are self-crossed to produce 189/509 somatic cells derived chicken with the donor’s characteristics. Microsatellite analysis and genome sequencing confirm the inheritance of genetic information from the donor. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of avian cloning from somatic cells.
      
      
        The authors reprogram chicken fibroblast cells to form primordial germ cells (PGCs) in one species (black feather Langshan chicken) and then show such PGCs can be transplanted and migrate into the genital ridge of another chicken species (White Plymouth Rock) to produce viable offspring with the Characteristics of donor.

"Evidences are escalating on the diverse neurologicaldisorders and asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID19 pandemic due to the Sanalfowchoking.

This mathematicalmodel is capable of predicting exactly the 3Dboundarylayerblockage factor of nanoscale diabaticfuidfow systems (fow involves the transfer of heat) at the Sanalfowchoking condition. As the pressure of the diabatic nanofuid and/ or noncontinuumfows rises, average-mean-free-path diminishes and thus, the Knudsen-number lowers heading to a zeroslip wallboundary condition with the compressibleviscousfow regime in the nanoscaletubes leading to Sanal-fow-choking due to the sonicfuidthroat efect.

in rosuvastatin exposure. PK characteristics, including intestinal and hepatic transporter/enzyme
specificities of telmisartan and rosuvastatin, were incorporated into the PBPK models to simulate a
rosuvastatin (20 mg) – telmisartan (80 mg) multiple dose drug interaction study. The simulated
rosuvastatin CmaxI/Cmax and AUCI/AUC (with/without telmisartan) ratios were 1.96 and 1.17,
respectively, and the Tmax changed from 3.35 h to 1.41 h with co-administration of telmisartan, which
are consistent with the aforementioned report (CmaxI/Cmax: 2.01, AUCI/AUC: 1.18, Tmax:
5 h → 0.75 h). The decrease in the CLint,BCRP, intestine of rosuvastatin by telmisartan in the PBPK model
was pivotal to reproducing this finding in Simcyp. Although most of the PK changes of rosuvastatin
are known to be OATP1B1-mediated, our PBPK model demonstrated that the major cause of
rosuvastatin–telmisartan DDI is intestinal BCRP-mediated, and not OATP1B1/1B3-mediated
interactions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Aims. To assess whether there is a change in the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation
after the strict lockdown measures due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain,
and to assess which are the factors associated with the incidence of a depressive episode or
suicidal ideation during the lockdown.
Methods. Data from a longitudinal adult population-based cohort from Madrid and
Barcelona were analysed (n = 1103). Face-to-face home-based (pre-pandemic) and telephone
interviews were performed. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed through an adaptation of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Population prevalence
estimates and multivariable logistic regressions were computed.
Results. Prevalence rates of depression changed significantly from before to after the COVID19 outbreak (from 3.06% to 12.00%; p = 0.01) and per sex and age groups. Individuals reporting
COVID-19 concerns (odds ratio [OR] = 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45–6.69)
and those feeling loneliness (OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.52–2.61) during the lockdown were at
increased risk of developing depression during the confinement. Resilience showed a protective effect against the risk of depression (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.39–0.83), while individuals
perceiving social support during the confinement were at lower risk of developing suicidal
thoughts (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09–0.46). Greater disability during the lockdown was also
associated with the risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.53–5.03).
Conclusions. Continuous reinforcement of mental health preventive and intervening measures is of global importance, particularly among vulnerable groups who are experiencing the
most distress. Future research should strive to evaluate the long-term effects of the COVID-19
crisis on mental health.",0
"The optimal scheduling problem of integrated energy system (IES) has the characteristics of highdimensional nonlinearity. Using the traditional Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to solve the problem, it is
easy to fall into a local optimum in the process of optimization, resulting in a low-quality scheduling
scheme. Aiming at the dispatchability of electric and heat loads, this paper proposes an electric and
heat comprehensive demand response model considering the participation of dispatchers. On the
basis of incentive demand response, the group aggregation model of electrical load is constructed,
and the electric load response model is constructed with the goal of minimizing the deviation between
the dispatch signal and the load group aggregation characteristic model. Then, a heat load scheduling
model is constructed according to the ambiguity of the human body’s perception of temperature. On
the basis of traditional GWO, the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is used to group wolves,
which increases the diversity of the population, uses the Harris Hawk Optimizer (HHO) to design the
prey to search for the best escape position, and reduces the local The optimal probability, and the use
of Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) and Bat Optimizer (BO) to design the moving modes of diferent
positions, increase the ability to fnd the global optimum, so as to obtain an Improved Gray Wolf
Optimizer (IGWO), and then efciently solve the model. IGWO can improve the defect of insufcient
population diversity in the later stage of evolution, so that the population diversity can be better
maintained during the entire evolution process. While taking into account the speed of optimization,
it improves the algorithm’s ability to jump out of the local optimum and realizes continuous deep
search. Compared with the traditional intelligent Optimizer, IGWO has obvious improvement and
achieved better results. At the same time, the comprehensive demand response that considers the
dispatcher’s desired signal improves the accommodation of new energy and reduces the operating
cost of the system, and promotes the benign interaction between the source and the load.",0
" Introduction
          Automatic blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are more and more often used in BP self-checks and in 24-hour BP monitoring. Nowadays, 24-hour BP monitoring is a necessary procedure in arterial hypertension treatment. The aim of this study was to validate the BPLab® ambulatory blood pressure monitor according to the European standard BS EN 1060-4:2004 and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol, as well as to work out solutions regarding the suitability of using this device in clinical practice.
        
        
          Methods
          A group of 85 patients of both sexes and different ages, who voluntarily agreed to take part in the tests and were given detailed instructions on the measurement technique were recruited for this study. The results of the BP measurement obtained by a qualified operator using the BPLab® device were compared with the BP values measured using the Korotkov auscultatory method. Data were obtained simultaneously by two experts with experience of over 10 years and had completed a noninvasive BP measurement standardization training course. Discrepancies in the systolic and diastolic BP measurements (N = 510; 255 for each expert) were analyzed according to the criteria specified in the BHS-93 protocol.
        
        
          Results
          The device passed the requirements of the European Standard BS EN 1060-4:2004 and was graded ‘A’ according to the criteria of the BHS protocol for both systolic BP and diastolic BP.
        
        
          Conclusion
          The BPLab® 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device may be recommended for extensive clinical use.",0
"Objective: The association between effort-reward imbalance (ERI) and various health outcomes has been well documented over the past
20 years, but the mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear. The present meta-analysis assessed the associations of ERI
and overcommitment (OC) in the workplace with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis measures.
Methods: Electronic databases were searched with the phrase “effort*reward*imbalance,” which yielded 319 studies leading to 56 fulltext studies being screened. Thirty-two studies within 14 articles met inclusion criteria and were meta-analyzed using mixed and random
effects models.
Results: Greater ERI was associated with increased HPA axis activity (r = .09, p < .001, k = 14, N = 2541). The cortisol awakening response (r = .14, p < .001, k = 9, N = 584) and cortisol waking concentrations (r = .12, p = .01, k = 6, N = 493) were the only HPA measures
associated with ERI. OC was also associated with greater HPA axis activity (r = .06, p < .01, k = 10, N = 1918). Cortisol (PM) (r = .13,
p = .02, k = 3, N = 295) was the only HPA measure associated with OC.
Conclusions: ERI and OC were similarly related with HPA responsivity. However, because OC moderated the relationship between ERI
and HPA axis markers, the importance of OC should not be overlooked. Because OC is likely more malleable than ERI to intervention, this
may be a promising avenue for future research.

"Purpose
          To identify and characterize the most cited publications in orthopaedic research related to posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries of the knee.
        
        
          Methods
          The Science Citation Index Expanded was queried for PLC injury articles. The 50 most-cited studies from 1976 to 2021 were selected. Article characteristics, including number of citations, citation density, year of publication, source journal, country of origin, article type, article subtype, and level of evidence, were analyzed.
        
        
          Results
          The number of citations for individual articles ranged from 47 to 205. The 50 most cited articles were published in 16 journals. Eleven of the 50 articles (22%) were published in Arthroscopy—The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery. The largest proportion of the articles (n = 22, 44%) were classified as clinical, with the rest classified as reviews (n = 15, 30%), and basic science research (n = 13, 26%). The most common level of evidence for clinical articles was IV (14/22, 63.6%). Nine countries contributed to the top 50 articles, with the majority published in the United States (n = 35, 70%).
        
        
          Conclusions
          In the last 20 years, papers published on the diagnosis and surgical management of PLC injuries have a high citation frequency. Future high-quality research is needed to establish best-practice guidelines for the management of PLC injuries due to the low overall level of evidence of existing clinical studies.
        
        
          Clinical Relevance
          This research provides a comprehensive list for practitioners and may help educators identify articles to include in the curriculum for residents and fellows.
         The posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee was once referred to as the “dark side” of the knee due to the historically limited understanding of PLC anatomy and the poor outcomes associated with injuries to this area.1 The PLC is a complex anatomical area that includes the lateral collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and the popliteofibular ligament.2 Injuries to the PLC often go undiagnosed and were previously considered to be a rare condition; however, they recently have been reported to be present in up to 16% of knee injuries.3 PLC injuries most often occur in conjunction with injury to other structures of the knee. Injury to the PLC of the knee is particularly associated with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, followed by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Up to 70% of PCL tears show concomitant damage to the PLC. While the identification of PLC injuries is sometimes difficult, diagnosis is crucial to optimizing surgical and clinical outcomes in these patients.4 If left untreated, these injuries can lead to chronic pain and instability, early development of osteoarthritis, and failure of cruciate ligament reconstructions.2,3,5
    Citation impact, or how many times a scientific publication is cited in the literature, can be used as an indicator of an article’s influence in a particular field of study.6,7 Although the number of times an article has been cited is not the only factor determining the importance an article has on its area of medical expertise, it can be useful for indicating the landmark scientific investigations or “citation classics” in a particular field.8 Analyses of most-cited papers can prove valuable to medical educators by helping identify articles of particular importance that may warrant inclusion in their trainees’ reading curriculum.
    In 2011, Lefaivre et al.9 published a citation analysis of the seminal works in orthopaedic surgery, and multiple similar studies have since investigated the most influential papers related to various orthopaedic subspecialties and conditions.7,9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize the most-cited publications in orthopaedic research related to PLC injuries of the knee. It was hypothesized that there would be many highly-cited articles related to PLC injuries published in the last 2 decades and that the minority would present high levels of evidence.",0
"Objective. Propofol is a classical anesthetic and induces consciousness loss, and gamma-aminobutyric-acid-type-A (GABA-A)
receptor is its target. Righting reflex is associated with conscious response. The nucleus basalis (NB) acts as a major relay
between the reticular activating system and the frontal cortex (FC). Propofol may mediate righting reflex by affecting GABA-A
receptor in NB. Methods. Fifty male SD rats (250-350 g) were divided into parts I and II. In part I, 20 male SD rats were
randomly divided into control group (CG) and NB-lesion group (NG, ibotenic acid-induced NB lesion). In part II, 30 male SD
rats were treated with saline (0.9% NaCl, SG group), muscimol (a GABA-A receptor agonist, MG group), and gabazine
(a GABA-A receptor antagonist, GG group) in NB, respectively. Two weeks later, the activity of the rats was measured between
CG and NG groups. The rats were intravenously injected with propofol (50 mg/kg/h) to test the time of loss of righting reflex
(LORR) in all rats. When LORR occurred, the rats received single administration of propofol (12 mg/kg) to measure the time of
return of righting reflex (RORR). Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of the frontal cortex (FC) was recorded. Results. The
numbers of NB neurons were reduced by 44% in the NG group compared to the CG group (p < 0:05) whereas the activity of
rats was reduced a little in the NG group when compared with the CG group, but the statistical difference was insignificant
(p > 0:05). The dose-response curve of propofol shifted to the left in the NG group, and the statistical difference for the time of
LORR was insignificant between the two groups (p > 0:05). However, the time of RORR and FC delta power increased in the
NG group compared with the CG group (p < 0:05). In part II, the time of RORR and FC powder increased in the MG group
when compared to the SG group while reverse results were observed in the GG group (p < 0:05). There was no significant
influence on the time of LORR and ED50 among the three groups (p > 0:05). Conclusions. The unilateral NB lesion increased
the recovery time and FC delta power, and the NB region might be involved in the emergence after propofol administration.
Propofol plays a crucial role for causing conscious loss by affecting GABA-A receptor in NB.",0
"Background. Along with increasing research on acupuncture for chronic pain, the validity of sham acupuncture (SA)
has also been argued. Methods. Nine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the
inception dates of the databases to July 5, 2022. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a Bayesian multipletreatment network meta-analysis (NMA) with random-effects model was conducted. Results. A total of 62 RCTs with
6,806 patients and four kinds of treatments (real acupuncture [RA], non-acupuncture [NA], penetrative SA [PSA], and
non-penetrative SA [NPSA]) were included. The results indicated that both NPSA and PSA were not superior to NA
in improving chronic pain (NPSA: mean difference [MD]¼ –4.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] –11.09 to 1.52; PSA:
MD¼ –4.96, 95% CI –10.38 to 0.48). After NPSA and PSA were combined into the SA group, the weak trend of pain
relief from SA was still not statistically significant (MD¼ –4.91, 95% CI –9.93 to 0.05). NPSA and PSA had similar
effects (MD¼ 0.18, 95% CI –5.45 to 5.81). RA was significantly associated with pain relief, compared with NPSA and
PSA (NPSA: MD¼ –12.03, 95% CI –16.62 to –7.41; PSA: MD¼ –11.85, 95% CI –15.48 to –8.23). The results were generally consistent regardless of pain phenotype, frequency, duration, acupuncture methods, analgesic intake, or detection bias. Conclusion. These results suggested that acupuncture was significantly associated with reduced chronic
pain. The two kinds of placebo acupuncture, NPSA and PSA, have similar effects. Both NPSA and PSA, with a weak
but not significant effect, are appropriate to be inert placebo controls in RCTs for chronic pain.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
was to investigate the role of LINC01296 in the
progression of liver cancer (LCa) and to explore
its possible molecular mechanisms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TCGA database
was used for information mining to verify the expression of LINC01296 in liver tumor tissues and
normal tissues. The levels of LINC01296 in 40 pairs
of LCa and adjacent tissues, as well as normal liver
cell lines and liver cancer cell lines, were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (qRT-PCR). The Chi-square test was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of
tumor samples and LINC01296 expression. Meanwhile, the Chi-square test was used to explore the
relationship between different clinical indicators
and the expression of LINC01296. The liver cancer
cell lines were screened and transfected with siRNA-LINC01296 and microRNA-760 inhibitor, as well
as corresponding negative controls, respectively.
Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays
were used to determine the effects of LINC01296
on the proliferative and invasive capacities of cells.
Furthermore, the regulatory association between
LINC01296 and microRNA-760 was verified by the
Dual-Luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: LINC01296 expression was remarkably higher in LCa tissues than that of normal
liver tissues. Meanwhile, LINC01296 expression
was associated with poor prognosis of LCa.
Patients with high LINC01296 expression were
more likely to have lymph node metastasis. In
vitro experiments showed that the knockdown
of LINC01296 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Meanwhile, microRNA-760 was remarkably lowly expressed in
LCa tissues and cells. Subsequent experiments
indicated that LINC01296 was regulated by
miR760 in LCa tissues, and high expression of
linc0129 could limit microRNA-760 expression.
Furthermore, the inhibition of microRNA-760 in
HCC cells reversed the effect of LINC01296
knockdown on cell proliferation and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: LINC01296 could promote the
proliferative ability and invasiveness of hepatoma cells by inhibiting the expression of microRNA-760. Moreover, its expression was closely related to lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of LCa. ",0
"  A prevalent symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is hypomimia — reduced facial expressions. In this paper, we present a method for diagnosing PD that utilizes the study of micro-expressions. We analyzed the facial action units (AU) from 1812 videos of 604 individuals (61 with PD and 543 without PD, with a mean age 63.9 y/o, sd. 7.8) collected online through a web-based tool (www.parktest.net). In these videos, participants were asked to make three facial expressions (a smiling, disgusted, and surprised face) followed by a neutral face. Using techniques from computer vision and machine learning, we objectively measured the variance of the facial muscle movements and used it to distinguish between individuals with and without PD. The prediction accuracy using the facial micro-expressions was comparable to methodologies that utilize motor symptoms. Logistic regression analysis revealed that participants with PD had less variance in AU6 (cheek raiser), AU12 (lip corner puller), and AU4 (brow lowerer) than non-PD individuals. An automated classifier using Support Vector Machine was trained on the variances and achieved 95.6% accuracy. Using facial expressions as a future digital biomarker for PD could be potentially transformative for patients in need of remote diagnoses due to physical separation (e.g., due to COVID) or immobility.",0

"BACKGROUND
          Reflux esophagitis (RE) is a common digestive disorder, and its frequent recurrences cause significant physical pain and are financially burdensome to patients. However, studies on the natural history of treated RE are few. Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as the first-line treatment provide notable symptomatic relief, disordered gut microbiota has been observed among PPI users. Probiotics are commonly administered to patients to regulate the disordered intestinal flora.
        
        
          AIM
          To evaluate the therapeutic effects in RE patients treated with a combination of esomeprazole and probiotics [Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium)].
        
        
          METHODS
          One hundred and thirty-four RE patients were randomized into two groups of 67 subjects each. The probiotics group was administered with esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. and live combined B. subtilis and E. faecium enteric-coated capsules 500 mg t.i.d. for eight weeks; the placebo group was administered with esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. and placebo for eight weeks. Subsequently, 12-wk follow-up was carried out on patients who achieved both endoscopic and clinical cure. Endoscopy, reflux diagnostic questionnaire (RDQ), gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), and lactulose hydrogen breath test were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
        
        
          RESULTS
          Sixty-six patients in the probiotics group and 64 patients in the placebo group completed the 8-wk treatment. The healing rate and RDQ score had no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, the GSRS diarrhea syndrome score was decreased significantly in the probiotics group (P = 0.002), and the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth negative rate in the probiotics group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (P = 0.002). Of 114 endoscopically and clinically cured patients, 96 completed the follow-up. The log-rank test showed that the time to relapse was shorter in the placebo group than in the probiotics group (P = 0.041). Furthermore, the therapy had a significant influence on relapse time, and the risk of relapse in the probiotics group was lower than that in the placebo group at any time point during the 12-wk follow-up (hazard ratio = 0.52, P = 0.033).
        
        
          CONCLUSION
          Esomeprazole combined with probiotics (B. subtilis and E. faecium) have a beneficial effect on RE treatment and patient management.

"Background: To investigate the association between keratoconus (KC) and
allergic eye diseases, eye rubbing, and atopy.
Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were
searched for studies investigating eye allergy, atopy, and eye rubbing as risk
factors for KC up to April 2021. Two authors independently screened all titles
and abstracts against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study
analysed the prevalence of KC and its risk factors, including eye rubbing, family history of KC, atopy, and allergic eye diseases. The National Institutes of
Health Study Quality Assessment Tool was used. Pooled data are presented as
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The analysis was conducted using RevMan version 5.4 software.
Results: The initial search yielded 573 articles. After screening, 21 studies
were identified for qualitative analysis and 15 for quantitative synthesis. A significant association was found between KC and eye rubbing (OR = 5.22, 95%
CI [2.80, 9.75], p < 0.00001), family history of KC (OR = 6.67, 95% CI [4.77,
9.33], p < 0.00001), and allergies (OR = 2.21, 95% CI [1.57, 3.13], p < 0.00001).
However, no significant association was found between KC and allergic eye
disease (OR = 1.82, 95% CI [0.37, 8.97], p = 0.46), atopy (OR = 1.54, 95% CI

"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is one of the most common causes of
acute liver injury (ALI) in Western countries. Many studies show that the gut microbiota plays an important role in liver injury. Currently, the only approved treatment
for APAP-induced ALI is N-acetylcysteine; therefore, it is essential to develop new
therapeutic agents and explore the underlying mechanisms. We developed a novel
monoclonal anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antibody (ATAB) and hypothesized that it
has therapeutic effects on APAP-induced ALI and that gut microbiota may be involved
in the underlying mechanism of ATAB treatment. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with
APAP and ATAB, which produced a therapeutic effect on ALI and altered the gut
microbiota and their metabolic pathway, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia,
and the fatty acid pathway, etc. Furthermore, we verified that purified short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) could alleviate ALI. Moreover, a separate group of mice that received
feces from the ATAB group showed less severe liver injury compared with the mice
receiving feces from the APAP group. ATAB therapy also improved the gut barrier functions in mice and reduced the expression of protein zonulin. Our results revealed that
gut microbiota plays an important role in the therapeutic effect of ATAB on APAPinduced ALI.
IMPORTANCE In this study, we found the monoclonal anti-Toll-like receptor 4 antibody can alleviate APAP-induced acute liver injury through the change of the gut
microbiota, metabolic pathways, and gut barrier function. This work suggested the
gut microbiota can be the therapeutic target of the APAP-induced acute liver injury,
and we performed the fundamental research for further research.",0
"In this work, a novel lollipop nanostructure of Co3O4@MnO2 composite is
prepared as anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Cobalt metal–
organic framework (ZIF-67) is grown on the open end of MnO2 nanotubes
via a self-assembly process. The obtained ZIF-67@MnO2 is then converted
to Co3O4@MnO2 by a simple annealing treatment in air. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction
characterizations indicate that the prepared Co3O4@MnO2 takes a lollipop
nanostructure with a stick of ≈100 nm in diameter, consisting of MnO2
nanotube, and a head part of ≈1 µm, consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles. The
charge–discharge tests illustrate that this unique novel configuration endows
the resulting Co3O4@MnO2 with excellent electrochemical performances,
delivering a capacity of 1080 mAh g−1

(LHCWs) who were respectively exposed to COVID-19 wards and non-COVID-19 wards by following up on mental disorders in
HCWs in China for 6 months.
Methods: A multi-psychological assessment questionnaire was used to follow up on the psychological status of HCWs in the
Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou City (a non-core epidemic area) at 6 months after the first evaluation
conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic. Based on the risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the HCWs were divided into two
groups: high-risk HCWs, who worked in COVID-19 wards, and low-risk HCWs, who worked in non-COVID-19 wards.
Results: A total of 198 HCWs participated in the study, and 168 questionnaires were selected for evaluation. Among them, 93
(55.4%) were in the HHCW group and 75 (44.5%) were in the LHCW group. Significant differences were observed in salary,
profession, and altruistic behavior between the two groups (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the anxiety, depression,
insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores between the two groups. Logistic regression revealed that work stress was
a major joint risk factor for mental disorders in HCWs. Among all the HCWs, a total of 58 voluntarily participated in psychotherapy;
the analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety, depression, PTSD, work stress, and work risk after attending psychotherapy.
There were also significant differences in positive and negative coping styles before and after psychotherapy.
Conclusion: In the present follow-up, work stress was the major contributing factor to mental disorders in HCWs. Psychotherapy is
helpful in terms of stress management and should be provided to first-line COVID-19 HCWs.

"– OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence has suggested that aberrant expression
of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) proliferation, migration, invasion and chemotherapy resistance.
Cullin4A (CUL4A) has been previously reported to desensitize NSCLC cells to chemotherapy
treatment. However, whether miRNAs regulate
CUL4A to promote chemotherapy resistance remains unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tissues were obtained from 40 NSCLC patients who received
surgery at the Yancheng City No. 1 People’s
Hospital. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays
were applied for the detection of cell proliferation; mRNA and protein levels were determined
by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. The interaction between mRNA 3’UTR and
miRNA was predicted by TargetScan and verified by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: In the present study, miR-363-
3p levels were revealed to be significantly decreased in tumor tissues obtained from NSCLC
patients compared with adjacent normal tissues. The results of the CCK-8 assays showed
that the overexpression of miR-363-3p may
slightly inhibit the proliferation of A549 and H23
cells. Notably, the transfection with miR-363-
3p antagonists reduced the sensitivity of A549
and H23 cells to gemcitabine treatment, whereas the overexpression of miR-363-3p markedly
increased the sensitivity of A549 and H23 cells
to gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, CUL4A
mRNA and protein levels were revealed to be
decreased in A549 cells transfected with miR363-3p mimics. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay results further suggested that CUL4A represents a target gene of miR-363-3p.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that decreased miR-363-3p expression enhanced gemcitabine resistance in NSCLC cells via regulation
of CUL4A.",0
"Summary
Introduction
The goal of hypospadias surgery is to provide a
functionally and cosmetically normal penis. Whether
this goal will be to the patient’s satisfaction depends
largely on the original anatomy, surgical technique
and surgeon’s experience. It has been suggested
that androgen administration is associated with
better outcomes in hypospadias repair; however,
few studies have included control groups and the
issue is still controversial.
Purpose
To evaluate the effects of parenteral testosterone
administration on the results of hypospadias repair
in children with untreated hypospadias.
Materials and methods
A total of 182 children with midshaft or distal
hypospadias and a mean age of 30 months (range
18e52 months) were enrolled in this study. Consecutive children were randomly allocated to the study
group (testosterone administration) (Group 1,
n Z 91) or control group (Group 2, n Z 91). Only
children with a flat urethral plate were included in
this study. The control group did not receive any
pre-operative treatment. Children with a previous
history of hypospadias repair and any proven endocrine disorder were excluded. The study children
received 2 mg/kg testosterone enanthate monthly
for two months before surgery. Tubularized incised
plate (TIP) urethroplasty, with or without chordee
correction, was performed for all children in both
groups by the same urologist. Hypospadias repair
was performed 4 weeks after the second dose of
testosterone administration. Postoperative complications were recorded, including: urethrocutaneous
fistulas, urethral diverticula, meatal stenosis, and
glanular dehiscence. The mean stretched penile
length and circumference were measured at baseline and at 1 month and 2 months post operation. All
children were examined every month for any
adverse affects to testosterone treatment, like
pubic and axillary hair, and height acceleration, up
to 3 months post operation.
Results
An increase in penile length (from 28.1  2.2 mm to
38.5  2.6 mm) (P Z 0.001) and penile circumference (from 35.1  1.6 mm to 45.5  2.2 mm)
(P Z 0.001) were noticed in all but four children in
Group 1. The actual values for increase in penile
length in the study group were, 22.0%, 35.0% and
36.0%, at postinjection months 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P Z 0.01, P Z 0.001 and P Z 0.001,
respectively) (Figure). The actual values for increase
in penile circumference in the study group were,
16.0%, 27.0% and 29.0%, at postinjection months 1, 2
and 3, respectively (P Z 0.01, P Z 0.001 and
P Z 0.001, respectively). The overall complication
rates were significantly higher in Group 2 [12 children, 13.18%) compared to Group 1 (five children,
5.45%) (P Z 0.03). Urethrocutaneous fistula was the
most common complication in both groups (four
children [4.39%] in Group 1 and seven children
[7.69%] in Group 2) (P Z 0.02), followed by meatal
stenosis (one child [1.09%] in Group 1 and three
children [3.29%] in Group 2) (P Z 0.03). All children
in Group 1 developed pigmentation of the genitalia,
and scant pubic hair appeared in 14 of them. These
side effects disappeared by the 3 months
postoperation follow-up visit.
Discussion
Tubularized incised plate urethroplasty is a popular
reconstructive method for hypospadias repair and is
widely accepted by pediatric urologists. It is a reliable and simple technique with low complication
rates. Testosterone administration before hypospadias repair decreases complication rates, reduces the
need for reoperation and results in better cosmetic
outcomes. Some studies have demonstrated temporary side effects like pubic hair growth and aggressive behavior, which gradually became normalized
after treatment cessation. Nowadays, many pediatric urologists administer testosterone prior to hypospadias surgery; however, this can be variable.
Conclusion
Parenteral testosterone administration before
hypospadias repair is beneficial in decreasing
complication rates.",0
"We conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the correlations of ezrin expression with pathological characteristics
and the prognosis of osteosarcoma. Te MEDLINE (1966–2013), the Cochrane Library Database, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of
Science (1945–2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database were searched without language restrictions. Meta-analyses conducted
using STATA sofware were calculated. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, including 459 patients with osteosarcoma. Metaanalysis results illustrated that ezrin expression may be closely associated with the recurrence of osteosarcoma or metastasis in
osteosarcoma. Our fndings also demonstrated that patients with grade III-IV osteosarcoma showed a higher frequency of ezrin
expression than those with histological grade I-II osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we found that patients with positive expression of
ezrin exhibited a shorter overall survival than those with negative ezrin expression. Te results also indicated that positive ezrin
expression was strongly correlated with poorer metastasis-free survival. Nevertheless, no signifcant relationships were observed
between ezrin expression and clinical variables (age and gender). In the current meta-analysis, our results illustrated signifcant
relationships of ezrin expression with pathological characteristics and prognosis of osteosarcoma. Tus, ezrin expression could be
a promising marker in predicting the clinical outcome of patients with osteosarcoma.",0
"Bone regeneration, as a physiological process of bone formation, is regulated by
multiple cytokines. Long noncoding RNAs are involved in the progress of bone
formation. The present study investigated role by which ZBED3‐AS1 acts to control
the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone regeneration.
Bioinformatics prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assay identified putative
ZBED3‐AS1 binding sites on the 3′‐untranslated region of interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β).
Then, RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ZBED3‐AS1 could regulate the expression of IL‐1β by binding to the
transcription factor CREB. Notably, ZBED3‐AS1 was shown to negatively regulate IL‐
1β expression. After model establishment in rats simulating bone injury, MSCs were
isolated and delivered with ZBED3‐AS1, Si‐ZBED3‐AS1, Si‐IL‐1β, or DKK (inhibitor of
Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway) to identify their roles in osteogenic differentiation
by evaluating MSC colony formation and proliferation. Then, number of mineralized
nodules, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OCN) expression, and
expression of osteogenesis‐related genes were determined. Overexpression of
ZBED3‐AS1 or silencing of IL‐1β was shown to accelerate ectopic osteogenesis, as
reflected by increasing the number of mineralized nodules, ALP activity, and OCN
expression, and promoting MSC colony formation and proliferation. Additionally,
ZBED3‐AS1 activated the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway by negatively regulating
IL‐1β. IL‐1β inhibited osteogenic differentiation by suppressing the Wnt/β‐catenin
signaling pathway. Furthermore, the effect of ZBED3‐AS1 and IL‐1β on osteogenic
differentiation was confirmed in vivo. Taken together, upregulation of ZBED3‐AS1
could restore differentiation of MSCs and enhance bone regeneration via activation
of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway by repressing IL‐1β.",0
"Growing evidence suggested that the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate several
pathophysiological processes in tumorigenesis and may be new biomarkers for tumor
therapy. In this study, we studied the expression and role of lncRNA MT1JP in the
development of bladder cancer. We demonstrated that the expression of MT1JP was
downregulated in bladder tumor samples and cell lines. Ectopic expression of MT1JP
suppressed cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion in bladder cancer. In addition, our result
suggested that miR‐214‐3p overexpression decreased the luciferase activity of wild‐type
MT1JP but not mutated‐type MT1JP and elevated expression of MT1JP decreased miR‐
214‐3p expression in the bladder cancer cell. Furthermore, we indicated that the
expression of miR‐214‐3p was upregulated in bladder tumor samples and cell lines.
Ectopic expression of miR‐214‐3p promoted cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion in
bladder cancer. MT1JP suppressed cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion via negative
modulation of miR‐214‐3p in bladder cancer. These data suggested that lncRNA MT1JP
acts a tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer progression, considering MT1JP as a
new therapeutic target in bladder cancer.",0
"More and more evidence show that major depressive disorder (MDD) is closely
related to inflammation caused by chronic stress, which seriously affects human
physical and mental health. However, the inflammatory mechanism of depression and its effect on brain function have not been clarified. Based on restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we investigated change
of brain functional imaging and the inflammatory mechanism of damage-related
molecular patterns (DAMPs)—receptor of advanced glycation protein end product (RAGE) in MDD patients and depressive-like cynomolgus monkeys and mice
models induced by chronic stress. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) were analyzed using MATLAB and SPM12 software. We
detected the expression of DAMPs-RAGE pathway-related proteins and mRNA
in MDD peripheral blood and in serum and brain tissue of cynomolgus monkeys
and mice. Meanwhile, RAGE gene knockout mice, RAGE inhibitor, and overexpression of AVV9RAGE adeno-associated virus were used to verify that RAGE is
a reliable potential biomarker of depression. The results showed that the ReHo

value of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in MDD patients and depressive-like cynomolgus monkeys was decreased. Then, the PFC was used as a seed point, the FC of
ipsilateral and contralateral PFC were weakened in depressive-like mice. At the
same time, qPCR showed that RAGE and HMGB1 mRNA were upregulated and
S100β mRNA was downregulated. The expression of RAGE-related inflammatory protein in PFC of depressive-like monkeys and mice were consistent with
that in peripheral blood of MDD patients. Moreover, the results were confirmed
in RAGE–/– mice, injection of FPS-ZM1, and overexpression of AAV9RAGE in
mice. To sum up, our findings enhance the evidence that chronic stress-PFCRAGE are associated with depression. These results attempt to establish the links
between brain functional imaging, and molecular targets among different species
will help to reveal the pathophysiological mechanism of depression from multiple perspectives.",0
"Resistin, secreted by macrophages in tumor microenvironment, has never been
investigated in pancreatic cancer models, despite a vibrant tumor microenvironment
around pancreatic tumors. We evaluated serum resistin levels in healthy individuals
versus pancreatic cancer patients representing different tumor grades. In vitro
mechanistic analysis involved MiaPaCa‐2 and SW1990 cells. Resistin signaling
depends on binding of resistin to its cognitive receptors. Therefore, we silenced
adenylyl cyclase‐associated protein 1 (CAP1) and toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4), its two
known receptors, individually as well as in combination, by short hairpin RNA
(shRNA). Effect of resistin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and
sensitivity to gemcitabine was studied without or with silencing of resistin receptors
CAP1 and/or TLR4. The results were also confirmed in vivo in mice xenografted with
MiaPaCa‐2 cells without or with receptor silencing. We report high resistin levels in
pancreatic cancer patients which correlate positively with tumor grades. We
observed a marked reduction in the resistin‐induced proliferation, migration,
invasion, and cell cycle of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa‐2 and SW1990 when
the receptors were silenced. The results were confirmed in vivo wherein resistin
effects were significantly attenuated in MiaPaCa‐2 xenografts with silenced
receptors. The combined silencing of CAP1 and TLR4 was found to be most effective
in vitro and in vivo. We found activation of STAT3 by resistin in vivo and in vitro
which was dependent on the presence of CAP1 and TLR4. Further, resistin was found
to induce resistance to gemcitabine through its receptors. Our results describe novel
functional roles of resistin with implications toward a better understanding of
pancreatic tumor microenvironment.",0

"Background: The intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) is associated with high mortality and severe disability in survivors, which
causing about 42% of the disability-adjusted life years lost and 50% of all stroke patients dead within 1 year. Although early functional
training is recommended to facility rehabilitation after the stroke, the benefit and safety are still controversial.
Introduction: This systematic review aims to investigate whether early physical rehabilitation could have a beneficial effect for the
patients with ICH compared with standard rehabilitation care.
Methods and analysis: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane library will be searched to include randomized control trials which
investigate the rehabilitation effective of the early mobilization for patients with ICH compared with routine nursing or standard care.
Rev-Man version 5.3 will be used to perform all calculations related to the meta-analysis. Dichotomous data will be calculated in terms
of a fixed or random effect model and expressed by the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochrane
collaborations tool in the following aspects was used to assess the risk of bias (ROB) in included studies. The inconsistency index (I

"t. Background/Aim: The aim of this study was the
conception, production, material analysis and
cytocompatibility analysis of a new collagen foam for
medical applications. Materials and Methods: After the
innovative production of various collagen sponges from
bovine sources, the foams were analyzed ex vivo in terms of
their structure (including pore size) and in vitro in terms of
cytocompatibility according to EN ISO 10993-5/-12. In vitro,
the collagen foams were compared with the established soft
and hard tissue materials cerabone and Jason membrane
(both botiss biomaterials GmbH, Zossen, Germany). Results:
Collagen foams with different compositions were successfully
produced from bovine sources. Ex vivo, the foams showed a
stable and long-lasting primary structure quality with a
bubble area of 1,000 to 2,000 μm2. In vitro, all foams
showed sufficient cytocompatibility. Conclusion: Collagen
sponges represent a promising material for hard and soft
tissue regeneration. Future studies could focus on
integrating and investigating different additives in the foams.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body
and constitutes around 25-30% of the total amount of protein
(1, 2). Up to now, 28 different types of collagen have been
discovered (3). As an essential part of the extracellular
matrix (ECM), different collagen types can be found in
bones, cartilage, tendons and skin, as well as in teeth, cornea
and blood vessels (4-6). Collagen is biocompatible and
completely biodegradable by endogenous human proteases
(7, 8). In addition, it is characterized by its ability to
positively influence cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and
differentiation (1, 4, 9). These qualities can be further
increased by adding growth and differentiation factors to the
collagen matrix (10, 11). Antibacterial properties can be
developed by adding nanoparticles such as AgNP (12, 13).
By additional physical as well as chemical cross-linking (6-
8, 14) or the combination of different types of collagen with
and without additional bioabsorbable materials, the usually
short-lasting degradation time of natural collagen can be
further extended, which ensures a sufficient durability (e.g.,
in wound dressings) (15, 16).
These properties make collagen as one of the most
promising biomaterials in modern medicine. Depending on
the area of application, it is obtained autogenously,
allogenically or xenogenically (17, 18). Collagen is widely
used as a wound dressing in the treatment of acute or chronic
wounds (19), burn wounds (20, 21) or sites of skin donation
and skin grafts (22), through its ability of shielding the
wound from infection and contamination, reducing scarring,
absorbing wound exudate, and promoting the skin’s natural
regeneration ability (19, 23, 24). In addition, collagen is able
to bind platelets and thus activate the coagulation cascade
(25, 26), which makes it very suitable for acute use in wound
care. Resorbable barrier membranes made of collagen are of
great importance in guided bone regeneration (GBR) for
dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, in order to
shield the regenerating bone from the ingrowth of the
surrounding tissue (27-29). Furthermore, different
compositions of collagen can be used as tissue grafts in

peripheral nerve regeneration, vascular prostheses and
arterial reconstruction (30-33). In addition, by promoting cell
growth and adhesion, collagen is ideally suited as a
substance in tissue engineering, where it can be used as part
of bioinks to encapsulate cells (34, 35) or as basic substance
for scaffold production (2, 22). Thereby, it is essential for the
development of artificial skin implants (36, 37).
The present study aimed to develop a new collagen foam
based on bovine split skin for tissue regeneration. The
regeneration-promoting properties of collagen are extensively
described in literature (4, 15, 38). Especially for wound
regeneration, collagen foams appear to be a promising
approach, since a foam can optimally adapt to a wound bed in
terms of area and volume and has both a shielding and
cushioning effect on the tissue (19). The approach of using
biomaterials as applicable foams in wound management has
already been implemented in a different context. The wound
foams that have been used up to now are primarily designed
for the care of moist or weeping chronic wounds, as their base
materials have good exudate-absorbing characteristics (19).
With the use of collagen and the creation of a moisturizing
instead of a dehumidifying environment in the wound bed, the
foam presented in this study aims to positively influence the
self-healing of soft tissue by using the natural regenerative
properties of this biomaterial. The newly developed collagenbased foam has the potential to be a new and innovative
biomaterial for use in soft tissue regeneration and could play a
major role in the care of patients with acute or chronic wounds.
The focus of this preclinical study was to analyze the
material characteristics and cytocompatibility of different
novel collagen foams. For this purpose, pore size, density
and surface structure of the foams were examined and
described ex vivo using a dynamic foam analyzer (DFA) and
cryo-SEM. In addition, in vitro cytocompatibility studies
were carried out in accordance with ISO 10993-5/-12, as
already described in previous work (24, 39, 40).",0
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe loss of motor and sensory function with high disability and mortality. The effective treatment of SCI remains unknown. Here we find systemic injection of TGF-β neutralizing antibody induces the protection of axon growth, survival of neurons, and functional recovery, whereas erythropoietin-producing hepatoma interactor B2 (EphrinB2) expression and fibroblasts distribution are attenuated. Knockout of TGF-β type II receptor in fibroblasts can also decrease EphrinB2 expression and improve spinal cord injury recovery. Moreover, miR-488 was confirmed to be the most upregulated gene related to EphrinB2 releasing in fibroblasts after SCI and miR-488 initiates EphrinB2 expression and physical barrier building through MAPK signaling after SCI. Our study points toward elevated levels of active TGF-β as inducer and promoters of fibroblasts distribution, fibrotic scar formation, and EphrinB2 expression, and deletion of global TGF-β or the receptor of TGF-β in Col1α2 lineage fibroblasts significantly improve functional recovery after SCI, which suggest that TGF-β might be a therapeutic target in SCI.

"In this study, the phase transition of NaVO2F2 was measured at different temperatures via in situ Raman
spectroscopy. The NaVO2F2 compounds were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and were
identified to be monoclinic with the P21/c space group at room temperature by XRD. Accordingly, the
variations of Raman shifts and intensities of the characteristic peaks for NaVO2F2 associated with
temperature were obtained and investigated. It was confirmed that NaVO2F2 had three types of phase
transitions, which occurred in the temperature region from 78 K to 573 K. Further, the results indicate
that transition from a low-temperature phase (I) to another low-temperature phase (II), low-temperature
phase (II) to P21/c phase and P21/c phase to P21/m phase occurred near the three temperature points of
93 K, 233 K, and 453 K, respectively, during the heating process. Therefore, a novel characterization
method was provided for further research on the phase transition theory and performance of vanadate
compounds.",0
"Background and objective
The effectiveness of deferred surgical repair of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) post-myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiogenic shock remains limited to case reports. Our study
aimed to investigate the outcomes and survival analysis following mechanical circulatory
support (MCS) in patients after VSR who develop cardiogenic shock.
Methods
We analyzed 27 patients with post-MI VSR and cardiogenic shock who received deferred
surgical repair while stabilized on MCS between January 2018 and March 2020. After normality test adjustments, continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). These were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. To identify predictors
of operative mortality, univariate analysis of clinical characteristics and interventions followed by logistic regression was carried out. P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
All patients had preoperative MCS. Emergency repair was avoided in all the patients. The
mean age of the participants was 64.96 with the majority being males (74.1%). On average,
the mean time from MI to VSR repair was 18.85 days. Delayed revascularization was associated with increased mortality (OR 17.500, 95% CI 2.365–129.506, P = 0.005). Other factors associated with increased mortality were ejection fraction (EF), three-vessel disease,
Killip class, early surgery, and prolonged use of inotropes. The operative mortality was 11%
with an overall mortality of 33.3%. The one-year survival rate was 66.7%. Conclusion
The use of MCS in adjunct to a deferred surgical approach shows an improved survival outcome of patients with VSR complicated by cardiogenic shock. Further investigations are
required regarding the optimal time for MCS and surgical repair.",0
"Long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) was reported to regulate the pathogenesis of ischemic
stroke. The study aimed to disclose SNHG7 role in oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced Neuro-2a (N2a) cell
disorders. An OGD injury cell model was established using N2a cells. The expression of SNHG7, microRNA-134-5p (miR134-5p) and fbroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein
expression was detected by western blot. Cell viability and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage were determined by cell
counting kit-8 and LDH activity detection assays. Oxidative stress was investigated by Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase
activity assays as well as Malondialdehyde and Reactive Oxygen Species detection kits. Cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were severally demonstrated by fow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assays. The interaction between miR-134-5p and
SNHG7 or FGF9 was predicted by online databases, and identifed by mechanism assays. OGD treatment decreased SNHG7
and FGF9 expression, but increased miR-134-5p expression. OGD treatment repressed cell viability, promoted LDH leakage
and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in N2a cells, which was rescued by SNHG7 overexpression. SNHG7 acted as
a sponge for miR-134-5p, and regulated OGD-triggered cell damage by associating with miR-134-5p. Additionally, miR134-5p depletion protected N2a cells from OGD-induced injury by targeting FGF9. Ectopic SNHG7 expression protected
against OGD-induced neuronal cell injury by inducing FGF9 through sponging miR-134-5p, providing a novel therapeutic
target for ischemic stroke.",0
"Aim: We conducted a meta-analysis of case-control studies to determine whether ALDH2, ADH1 and ADH2 genetic
polymorphisms contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
Methods: The PubMed, CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases
were searched for relevant articles published before November 1st, 2013 without any language restrictions. Meta-analysis
was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. We calculated crude odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals
(95%CI) to evaluate their relationships under five genetic models. Seven case-control studies with a total of 2,563 gastric
cancer patients and 4,192 healthy controls met the inclusion criteria. Nine common polymorphisms were evaluated,
including rs671, rs16941667 and rs886205 in the ALDH2 gene, rs1230025, rs13123099, rs698 and rs1693482 in the ADH1
gene, and rs1229984 and rs17033 in the ADH2 gene.
Results: The results of our meta-analysis suggested that ALDH2 genetic polymorphisms might be strongly correlated with
an increased risk of gastric cancer (allele model: OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.11,1.32, P,0.001; dominant model: OR = 1.23, 95%CI:
1.09,1.39, P = 0.001; respectively), especially for rs671 polymorphism. Furthermore, we observed significant associations
between ADH1 genetic polymorphisms and an increased risk of gastric cancer (allele model: OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.08,1.36,
P = 0.001; dominant model: OR = 10.52, 95%CI: 3.04,36.41, P,0.001; respectively), especially for rs1230025 polymorphism.
Nevertheless, no positive relationships were found between ADH2 genetic polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk (all
P.0.05).
Conclusion: The current meta-analysis suggests that ALDH2 and ADH1 genetic polymorphisms may play crucial roles in the
pathogenesis of gastric cancer. However, ADH2 genetic polymorphisms may not be important dominants of susceptibility
to gastric cancer.",0
"Cyanobacterial strains can grow within a specific temperature range that
approximately corresponds to their natural habitat. However, how the preferable temperature range for growth (PTRG) is determined at the molecular
level remains unclear. In this study, we detected a PTRG upshift in a mutant
strain of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 lacking the circadian rhythm
regulator RpaA. Subsequent analyses revealed that RpaA decreases the electron transport from photosystem I to NADPH. The change in electron transport likely inhibits H2O2 generation under high-temperature conditions and
contributes to the observed PTRG upshift in rpaA-deficient cells. The importance of the effects of the circadian rhythm regulator on the PTRG is discussed.

" Background
        Assessment of pain has always been subjective and is commonly assessed using a numeric pain scale (NPS) or Wong-Baker faces scale. The pain intensity score is not standardized and relies on individuals’ past experiences. The disadvantage of using such pain assessment scales and treating the numbers can lead to overdosing on analgesics leading to unwanted side effects. The Robert Packer Hospital/Functional Pain Scale (RPH/FPS) was developed as a tool for the objective assessment of pain and its impact on a patient’s function. 
        Aim
        The study aimed to validate the RPH/FPS scale against NPS and Wong-Baker faces scale in medical, surgical, and trauma patients. The patients’ were also asked to rank the scales as one (1) being the most preferred to three (3) being the least preferred.
        Design
        This prospective, observational cohort study compares the two most common pain scales, the NPS and the Wong-Baker Faces, to the RPH/FPS.
        Methods
        Spearman correlation was used to test for correlation between the three scales, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare means between the RPH/FPS and NPS. The study participants were also asked to rate their preferences for the scales by rating the most preferred of the three scales as one (1) and the least preferred number three (3). 
        Results
        The RPH/FPS had a strong correlation with both the NPS and Wong-Baker Faces scales (RPH/FPS vs. NPS R=0.69, p<0.001: RPH-FPS vs. Wong-Baker Faces R=0.69, P<0.001). As for preferences, the RPH/FPS was ranked first on 36.9% of the surveys followed by NPS on 35.9%, and the Wong-Baker Faces on 22.3%. There were 4.9% of the surveys missing the preference rankings.
        Conclusion
        The results validate the RPH/FPS scale against the NPS and Wong-Baker Faces scales. This gives the clinicians a tool for objective assessment of pain and its effect on the recovery process, thereby minimizing the observed disconnect that sometimes happens between the reported pain intensity level and the providers' observation of the patient.",0
"The load transfer difficulty caused by borehole wall friction severely limits the penetration
rate and extended-reach limit of complex structural wells. A new friction reduction technology termed “earthworm-like drilling” is proposed in this paper to improve the load transfer of
complex structural wells. A mathematical model based on a “soft-string” model is developed
and solved. The results show that earthworm-like drilling is more effective than single-point
vibration drilling. The amplitude and frequency of the pulse pressure and the installation
position of the shakers have a substantial impact on friction reduction and load transfer. An
optimization model based on the projection gradient method is developed and used to optimize the position of three shakers in a horizontal well. The results verify the feasibility and
advantages of earthworm-like drilling, and establish a solid theoretical foundation for its
application in oil field drilling.",0
"Abstract—Peripheral chemoreflex is activated during short-term sustained hypoxia (SH), and the first synapse of
these afferents is located in Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS). NTS neurons projecting to the ventral lateral
medulla (NTS-VLM) are part of the respiratory pathways of the chemoreflex. SH increases the magnitude of basal
respiratory parameters in rats from Wistar-Hannover strain. In this study, we hypothesized that the observed
changes in the respiratory pattern in response to SH were due to changes in the GABAergic modulation of the
synaptic transmission of NTS-VLM neurons. We used an electrophysiological approach to record the synaptic
activity of NTS neurons labeled with a retrograde tracer previously microinjected into VLM of Wistar-Hannover
rats submitted to 24 h SH. The data are showing that: (a) the amplitude of evoked inhibitory currents in NTSVLM neurons of SH rats was reduced and not accompanied by any change in rise-time and decay-time; (b) the
1/CV2 and the number of failures in response to evoked currents were also affected by SH; (c) the frequency of
spontaneous inhibitory currents was reduced by SH without changes in amplitude and half-width. These effects
of SH were observed in NTS-VLM neurons located in caudal and intermediate NTS, but not in NTS-VLM neurons
located in the rostral NTS. We conclude that SH causes a reduction in inhibitory modulation onto NTS-VLM neurons by pre-synaptic mechanisms, which may contribute to the observed changes in the respiratory pattern of
Wistar-Hannover rats submitted to SH. _x0001_ 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Antiandrogens have demonstrated a protective effect for COVOD-19 patients in
observational and interventional studies. The goal of this study was to determine
if proxalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, could be an effective treatment
for men with COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. A randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at two outpatient centers (Brasilia, Brazil).
Patients were recruited from October 21 to December 24, 2020 (clinicaltrials.gov number,
NCT04446429). Male patients with confirmed COVID-19 but not requiring hospitalization
(COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale <3) were administered proxalutamide 200 mg/day or
placebo for up to 7 days. The primary endpoint was hospitalization rate at 30 days postrandomization. A total of 268 men were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. 134 patients receiving
proxalutamide and 134 receiving placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.2% in men taking proxalutamide compared to 26%
in placebo, P < 0.001. The 30-day hospitalization risk ratio was 0.09; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.03–0.27. Patients in the proxalutamide arm more frequently reported
gastrointestinal adverse events, however, no patient discontinued treatment. In placebo
group, 6 patients were lost during follow-up, and 2 patients died from acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Here we demonstrate the hospitalization rate in proxalutamide treated
men was reduced by 91% compared to usual care.",0
"Endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants are reported as potent producers of
diverse classes of secondary metabolites. In the present study, an endophytic fungi, Aspergillus clavatonanicus strain MJ31, exhibiting significant antimicrobial activity was isolated
from roots of Mirabilis jalapa L., was identified by sequencing three nuclear genes i.e. internal transcribed spacers ribosomal RNA (ITS rRNA), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA) and
translation elongation factor 1- alpha (EF 1Iˆ). Ethyl acetate extract of strain MJ31displayed
significant antimicrobial potential against Bacillus subtilis, followed by Micrococccus luteus
and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.078, 0.156
and 0.312 mg/ml respectively. In addition, the strain was evaluated for its ability to synthesize bioactive compounds by the amplification of polyketide synthase (PKS) and non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Further, seven antibiotics (miconazole,
ketoconazole, fluconazole, ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampicin) were
detected and quantified using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Additionally, thermal desorption-gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) analysis of strain MJ31 showed the presence of 28 volatile compounds. This is the first report on A. clavatonanicus as an endophyte
obtained from M. jalapa. We conclude that A. clavatonanicus strain MJ31 has prolific antimicrobial potential against both plant and human pathogens and can be exploited for the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds and could be an alternate source for the production
of secondary metabolites.",0
"Lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) is a histone H3 lysine 27
(H3K27) demethylase that serves as a key mediator of gene
transcription. Although KDM6B has been reported to modulate neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke, its role in
ischemic brain injury is yet to be well elucidated. Therefore,
this study aimed to thoroughly demonstrate the molecular
mechanism underlying the effect of KDM6B on neurological
function and astrocyte response in post-ischemic brain injury.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO) mouse
models were constructed, while the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model was developed in astrocytes
to mimic injury conditions. KDM6B was upregulated postMCAO in mice and in astrocytes following the induction of
OGD/R. Silencing of KDM6B resulted in suppressed neurological deficit, reduced cerebral infarction volume, attenuated
neuronal cell apoptosis, and disrupted inflammation. Dualluciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays revealed
that KDM6B inhibited H3K27 trimethylation in the interferon
regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) promoter region, resulting in the upregulation of IRF4 expression, which in turn bound to the
Notch2 promoter region to induce its downstream factor
SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (SOX9). SOX9 knockdown reversed the effects of KDM6B overexpression on
ischemia-triggered brain damage. Based on these findings, we
concluded that KDM6B-mediated demethylation of IRF4 contributes to aggravation of ischemic brain injury through SOX9
activation.",0
"Background and Aim: In the long-term prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic, parameters may change frequently for various
reasons, such as the emergence of mutant strains and changes in government policies. These changes will affect the efficiency of the
current emergency logistics network. Public health emergencies have typical unstructured characteristics such as blurred transmission
boundaries and dynamic time-varying scenarios, thus requiring continuous adjustment of emergency logistics network to adapt to the
actual situation and make a better rescue.
Practical Significance: The infectivity of public health emergencies has shown a tendency that it first increased and then decreased
in the initial decision-making cycle, and finally reached the lowest point in a certain decision-making cycle. This suggests that the
number of patients will peak at some point in the cycle, after which the public health emergency will then be brought under control and
be resolved. Therefore, in the design of emergency logistics network, the infectious ability of public health emergencies should be
fully considered (ie, the prediction of the number of susceptible population should be based on the real-time change of the infectious
ability of public health emergencies), so as to make the emergency logistics network more reasonable.
Methods: In this paper, we build a data-driven dynamic adjustment and optimization model for the decision-making framework with
an innovative emergency logistics network in this paper. The proposed model divides the response time to emergency into several
consecutive decision-making cycles, and each of them contains four repetitive steps: (1) analysis of public health emergency
transmission; (2) design of emergency logistics network; (3) data collection and processing; (4) adjustment and update of parameters.
Results: The result of the experiment shows that dynamic adjustment and update of parameters help to improve the accuracy of
describing the evolution of public health emergency transmission. The model successively transforms the public health emergency
response into the co-evolution of data learning and optimal allocation of resources.
Conclusion: Based on the above results, it is concluded that the model we designed in this paper can provide multiple real-time and
effective suggestions for policy adjustment in public health emergency management. When responding to other emergencies, our
model can offer helpful decision-making references.",0
"Atherosclerosis is one of the most common and crucial heart diseases involving the heart
and brain. At present, atherosclerosis and its major complications comprise the leading
causes of death worldwide. Our purpose was to identify the role of ciRS‐7 in atherosclerosis. Tubulogenesis of HMEC‐1 cell was evaluated utilizing tube formation assay. Cell
Counting Kit‐8 assay and flow cytometry were utilized to test viability and apoptosis.
Migration assay was utilized to determine the migration capacity of experimental cells.
Western blot was applied to examine apoptosis and tube formation‐associated protein
expression. In addition, the above experiments were repeated when silencing ciRS‐7,
overexpressing ciRS‐7, and upregulating miR‐26a‐5p. HMEC‐1 cells formed tube‐like
structures over time. Silencing ciRS‐7 suppressed viability, migration, and tube formation
but promoted apoptosis. Oppositely, overexpressing ciRS‐7 reversed the effect in
HMEC‐1 cells. miR‐26a‐5p expression was elevated by silencing ciRS‐7 and reduced by
overexpressing ciRS‐7. Moreover, overexpressing ciRS‐7 facilitated viability, migration,
and tube formation via upregulating miR‐26a‐5p. Conclusively, overexpressing ciRS‐7
mobilized phosphoinositide 3‐kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway and
suppressed c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 pathway. ciRS‐7 exerted influence on
apoptosis, viability, migration, and tube formation through mediating PI3K/AKT and
JNK/p38 pathways by miR‐26a‐5p downregulation in HMEC‐1 cells.",0
"MicroRNAs have been long considered synthesized endogenously until very recent discoveries showing that human can absorb dietary microRNAs from animal and plant origins
while the mechanism remains unknown. Compelling evidences of microRNAs from rice,
milk, and honeysuckle transported to human blood and tissues have created a high volume
of interests in the fundamental questions that which and how exogenous microRNAs can
be transferred into human circulation and possibly exert functions in humans. Here we present an integrated genomics and computational analysis to study the potential deciding features of transportable microRNAs. Specifically, we analyzed all publicly available
microRNAs, a total of 34,612 from 194 species, with 1,102 features derived from the microRNA sequence and structure. Through in-depth bioinformatics analysis, 8 groups of discriminative features have been used to characterize human circulating microRNAs and
infer the likelihood that a microRNA will get transferred into human circulation. For example,
345 dietary microRNAs have been predicted as highly transportable candidates where 117
of them have identical sequences with their homologs in human and 73 are known to be
associated with exosomes. Through a milk feeding experiment, we have validated 9 cowmilk microRNAs in human plasma using microRNA-sequencing analysis, including the top
ranked microRNAs such as bta-miR-487b, miR-181b, and miR-421. The implications in
health-related processes have been illustrated in the functional analysis. This work demonstrates the data-driven computational analysis is highly promising to study novel molecular
characteristics of transportable microRNAs while bypassing the complex mechanistic
details.",0
"Crohn’s disease is a chronic disease, which commonly affects women during their
reproductive years. Poorly treated Crohn’s disease is associated with adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Biologics, a group of therapeutic drugs targeting inflammatory mediators
including anti-TNF, anti-integrins and anti-interleukins, are increasingly used in pregnant
women with Crohn’s disease, exposing both the women and their fetuses to
treatment-related complications. At present, it is unclear which biologics are more
superior. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the
risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with Crohn’s disease after exposure
to biologics. Bibliographic databases were searched from inception to May 2021. The
outcomes of interest were preterm delivery, low birth weight, spontaneous abortion,
and congenital abnormalities. A total of 11 studies comprised of 1,875 pregnancies
among women with Crohn’s disease were included. Of these, 1,162 received biologics
and 713 received non-biologic therapy. During the remission phase of the disease, the
use of biological therapy increased the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, of which
anti-integrins were associated with a higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes
than anti-TNF and anti-interleukins",0
"The Wnt pathway is integrally involved in regulating self-renewal, proliferation, and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). We explored the effect of the Wnt antagonist, secreted
frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), in modulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
in CSCs from human glioblastoma cells lines, U87 and U373. sFRP4 chemo-sensitized
CSC-enriched cells to the most commonly used anti-glioblastoma drug, temozolomide
(TMZ), by the reversal of EMT. Cell movement, colony formation, and invasion in vitro were
suppressed by sFRP4+TMZ treatment, which correlated with the switch of expression of
markers from mesenchymal (Twist, Snail, N-cadherin) to epithelial (E-cadherin). sFRP4
treatment elicited activation of the Wnt-Ca2
+ pathway, which antagonizes the Wnt/ß-catenin
pathway. Significantly, the chemo-sensitization effect of sFRP4 was correlated with the reduction in the expression of drug resistance markers ABCG2, ABCC2, and ABCC4. The efficacy of sFRP4+TMZ treatment was demonstrated in vivo using nude mice, which showed
minimum tumor engraftment using CSCs pretreated with sFRP4+TMZ. These studies indicate that sFRP4 treatment would help to improve response to commonly used chemotherapeutics in gliomas by modulating EMT via the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. These findings could
be exploited for designing better targeted strategies to improve chemo-response and eventually eliminate glioblastoma CSCs.",0
"Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs in 5% to 18% of newborns. However, the underlying
inflammatory mechanisms have not been elucidated.
Methods: We established a mouse model of infection-associated PTB. Physical signs in pregnant
mice with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment were observed, and the frequencies of
Toll-like receptor (TLR)2- and TLR4-positive CD11bþ cells were analyzed. Cytokine levels in
plasma and pathological changes were assessed following LPS treatment. A rescue experiment
was used to probe potential immunologic mechanisms underlying PTB.
Results: Lymphocyte infiltration could be observed in the placentas of mice following intrauterine injection with LPS. The percentage of inflammatory cells decreased 12 hours after treatment.
Moreover, TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood cells was significantly increased
4 hours after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Peak TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral
blood cells occurred 8 hours post-treatment. TLR4 and TLR-2/4 inhibitors reduced levels of
interleukin-10, interferon-c, and tumor necrosis factor-a in peripheral blood and delayed PTB.
Conclusions: TLR2 and TLR4 inhibition could play important roles in PTB.",0
"COVID 19 is known to cause immune dysregulation and vitamin D is a known immunomodulator. This study aims to objectively investigate the impact of Pulse D therapy in reducing the inflammatory markers of COVID-19. Consented COVID-19 patients with hypovitaminosis D were evaluated for inflammatory markers (N/L ratio, CRP, LDH, IL6, Ferritin) along with vitamin D on 0th day and 9th/11th day as per their respective BMI category. Subjects were randomised into VD and NVD groups. VD group received Pulse D therapy (targeted daily supplementation of 60,000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 or 10 days depending upon their BMI) in addition to the standard treatment. NVD group received standard treatment alone. Differences in the variables between the two groups were analysed for statistical significance. Eighty seven out of one hundred and thirty subjects have completed the study (VD:44, NVD:43). Vitamin D level has increased from 16 ± 6 ng/ml to 89 ± 32 ng/ml after Pulse D therapy in VD group and highly significant (p < 0.01) reduction of all the measured inflammatory markers was noted. Reduction of markers in NVD group was insignificant (p > 0.05). The difference in the reduction of markers between the groups (NVD vs VD) was highly significant (p < 0.01). Therapeutic improvement in vitamin D to 80–100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 without any side effects. Hence, adjunctive Pulse D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19 for improved outcomes.",0
"The impairment of endothelial function by reduced endothelial
production of nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to the increased
risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients with
depression. NO also plays an essential role in the efficacy of
antidepressants. The present study aimed to confirm our previous preliminary findings using a larger sample and different
antidepressants. We enrolled 100 patients with major depressive
disorder (MDD) and 50 healthy controls. Patients were administered sertraline, duloxetine or mirtazapine and were followed up
for 8 weeks. We also compared the rate of increase in plasma
levels of metabolites of NO (NOx) among the three antidepressant treatments. Baseline plasma NOx levels were significantly
lower in the MDD group than in the control group. A negative
correlation was found between plasma NOx levels and the
severity of MDD. Treatment with duloxetine significantly
increased plasma NOx levels, whereas sertraline treatment
caused no significant increase.

"Summary
Background Magnesium sulphate given to women prior to very preterm birth protects the perinatal brain, so fewer
babies die or develop cerebral palsy. How magnesium sulphate exerts these beneficial effects remains uncertain.
The MagNUM Study aimed to assess the effect of exposure to antenatal magnesium sulphate on MRI measures of
brain white matter microstructure at term equivalent age.
Methods Nested cohort study within the Magnesium sulphate at 30 to <34 weeks’ Gestational age Neuroprotection Trial
(MAGENTA). Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12611000491965. Mothers at risk of preterm birth
at 30 to <34 weeks’ gestation were randomised to receive either 4 g of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate [8 mmol magnesium ions], or saline placebo, when preterm birth was planned or expected within 24 h. Participating babies underwent
diffusion tensor MRI at term equivalent age. The main outcomes were fractional anisotropy across the white matter tract
skeleton compared using Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), with adjustment for postmenstrual age at birth and at
MRI, and MRI site. Researchers and families were blind to treatment group allocation during data collection and analyses.
Findings Of the 109 babies the demographics of the 49 babies exposed to magnesium sulphate were similar to the
60 babies exposed to placebo. In babies whose mothers were allocated to magnesium sulphate, fractional anisotropy
was lower within the corticospinal tracts and corona radiata, the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and the
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi compared to babies whose mothers were allocated placebo (P < 0¢05).
Interpretation In babies born preterm after 30 weeks’ gestation, antenatal magnesium sulphate exposure did not promote development of white matter microstructure in pathways affecting motor or cognitive function. This suggests that
if the neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulphate treatment prior to preterm birth is confirmed at this gestation, the
mechanisms are not related to accelerated white matter maturation inferred from fractional anisotropy.
Funding This study was funded by a project grant from the Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC 14/153).

"Objective: Psychopathology in bariatric surgery patients may contribute
to adverse postoperative sequelae, including weight regain, substance
use, and self-harm. This cross-sectional study aimed to advance the understanding of the risk and protective paths through which weight bias
associates with depressive and anxiety symptoms in bariatric surgery
candidates (BSC).
Methods: BSC recruited from a surgical clinic (N=213, 82.2% women,
43 [SD 12] years, mean BMI: 49 [SD 9] kg/m2) completed measures of experienced weight bias (EWB), internalized weight bias (IWB), body and internalized shame, and self-compassion; anxiety and depression screeners
were accessed from medical charts. Multiple regression and PROCESS
bootstrapping estimates tested our hypothesized mediation model as follows: EWB→IWB→body shame→shame→self-compassion→symptoms.
Results: After accounting for EWB and IWB, internalized shame accounted for greater variance in both end points than body shame. EWB
was associated with greater anxiety through risk paths implicating IWB,
body shame, and/or internalized shame. Protective paths associated
EWB with fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms among those with
higher self-compassion.
Conclusions: The findings suggest a potentially important role for weight
bias and shame in psychological health among BSC and implicate selfcompassion, a trainable affect-regulation strategy, as a protective factor
that may confer some resiliency. Future research using longitudinal and
causal designs is warranted.",0

Methods: PCOS rat model was established by dehydroepiandrosterone induction. NEAT1, miR-381 and IGF1 expression in ovarian granulosa cells of PCOS patients and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were tested. Bioinformatics website
and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were utilized to verify the relationship between NEAT1 and miR-381 and that
between miR-381 and IGF1. Levels of sex hormone, pathological changes and ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in
ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were detected. Ovarian granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed in vitro.
Results: NEAT1 and IGF1 expression increased while miR-381 expression decreased in the ovarian granulosa cells of
patients with PCOS and the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vivo experiments, interference with NEAT1 improved
the levels of sex hormones, alleviated pathological changes and suppressed ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in the
ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vitro cell experiments, interference with NEAT1 suppressed apoptosis and enhanced
cell proliferation of ovarian granulosa cells. NEAT1 interference-mediated efect would be reversed by up-regulating
miR-381. NEAT1 acted as a ceRNA to adsorb miR-381 to target IGF1. Overexpression of IGF1 reversed the inhibitory
efect of miR-381 on ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis.
Conclusion: Interference with NEAT1 increases miR-381 and reduces IGF1 levels, efectively improving the levels of
sex hormones and reducing the pathological damage of ovarian tissue in rats with PCOS.

" Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpetic virus, which infects 45–100% people worldwide. Many reports suggest that CMV could impair cognitive functions of infected subjects. Here we searched for indices of effects of CMV on infected subjects’ intelligence and knowledge. The Intelligence Structure Test I-S-T 2000 R was used to compare IQ of 148 CMV-infected and 135 CMV-free university students. Infected students expressed higher intelligence. Paradoxically, their IQ decreased with decreasing concentration of anti-CMV antibodies, which can be used, statistically, as a proxy of the time passed from the moment of infection in young subjects when the age of subjects is statistically controlled. The paradox of seemingly higher intelligence of CMV infected subjects could be explained by the presence of the subpopulation of about 5–10% CMV-positive individuals in the population of “CMV-negative students”. These false negative subjects had probably not only the oldest infections and therefore the lowest concentration of anamnestic antibodies, but also the lowest intelligence among the infected students. Prevalence of CMV infection in all countries is very high, approaching sometimes 90%. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human intelligence may be large.",0
"Objective. To assess if body mass index (BMI) and high waist circumference (HWC) are associated with testing positive for the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods. 9,386 UK Biobank study participants tested for SARSCoV-2 from March 16th 2020 to June 29th 2020 were analyzed. A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted
risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction
between age and HWC. Results. Approximately 17% (n � 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had
a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR � 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17). For
participants ≥65 years, only obesity class II (RR � 1.38, 95% CI 1.10–1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight. While HWC was not associated with testing positive for SARSCoV-2 in those <65 years, having an HWC was associated with an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in participants ≥65 years (RR � 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.27). Conclusion. &e associations of BMI and HWC with testing positive for SARSCoV-2 differed by age. Notably, HWC was associated with testing positive in those ≥65 years, but not those who were younger,
independent of BMI. &is suggests that measures of adiposity in addition to BMI may be used to identify older individuals at
greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.",0
"Aims: Echinacoside (ECH) is a natural compound extracted from the stem of the Cistanche deserticola plant, has
significant biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-tumor, hep
atoprotective, and immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we aimed to explore the protection effects and
mechanisms of ECH on diabetic liver injury in db/db mice.
Main methods: Overall, 6-week-old db/db mice (n = 20) were randomly allocated to 2 groups: diabetic model
group (db/db group, intragastric administration of normal saline, n = 10) and ECH-treated group (db/db + ECH
group, n = 10). Additionally, the normal control group comprised 6-week-old db/m mice (db/m group, normal
saline intragastric administration, n = 10). ECH was administered once a day for 10 weeks. Weight and fasting
blood glucose (FBG) were measured biweekly. HE staining and Oil O staining were used to evaluate liver tissue
pathological changes and lipid accumulation respectively. Immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and RTPCR analysis were used to detect the expression of components of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling axis.
Key findings: The results showed that the administration of echinacoside for 10 weeks could significantly improve
liver injury and insulin resistance in db/db mice (p < 0.01). Also, echinacoside treatment helped to reduce blood
lipids and blood glucose (p < 0.01). Moreover, ECH actived AMPK/SIRT1 signaling, upregulated peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα),
carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1A (CPT1A) in db/db mice (p < 0.01).
Significance: The effect of ECH may be elicited by the activation of the liver AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and its
downstream factors to improve adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.",0

          Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are associated with increased cardiovascular risk when higher doses are used toward higher hematocrit targets. Patients new to dialysis are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. Systematic evaluation of this population was predefined in the roxadustat clinical development program. Roxadustat is a hypoxia-inducible prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor.
          Methods
          Data were pooled from 3 phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials. Eligible adults had kidney failure and initiated dialysis for 2 weeks to ≤ 4 months prior to randomization to roxadustat or epoetin alfa. Efficacy was assessed as mean change in hemoglobin from baseline averaged over weeks 28 to 52, regardless of rescue therapy. Key cardiovascular safety endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; all-cause mortality [ACM], myocardial infarction, and stroke), and MACE+ (MACE plus unstable angina or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization), and ACM.
          Results
          This study included 1530 patients with kidney failure incident to dialysis. Mean (SD) changes in hemoglobin from baseline averaged over weeks 28 to 52, regardless of rescue therapy, were 2.12 (1.45) versus 1.91 (1.42) g/dl in the roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups (least-squares mean difference: 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.40; P = 0.0130). Risks of MACE and MACE+ were lower in the roxadustat group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96) than the epoetin alfa group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.89); the HR for ACM was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.11).
        
        
          Conclusion
          Roxadustat was at least as efficacious as epoetin alfa. Roxadustat had a lower risk of MACE/MACE+ in patients new to dialysis.

"The survival of microglia depends on the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling pathway under physiological conditions.
Ki20227 is a highly selective CSF1R inhibitor that has been shown to change the morphology of microglia. However, the effects of Ki20227 on
the progression of ischemic stroke are unclear. In this study, male C57BL/6 mouse models of focal cerebral ischemic injury were established
through the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and then administered 3 mg/g Ki20227 for 3 successive days. The results revealed that
the number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1/bromodeoxyuridine double positive cells in the infarct tissue was reduced, the
degree of edema was increased, neurological deficits were aggravated, infarct volume was increased, and the number of peri-infarct Nissl
bodies was reduced. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells in the peri-infarct tissue was
increased. The expression levels of Bax and Cleaved caspase-3 were up-regulated. Bcl-2 expression was downregulated. The expression levels
of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-associated factors were increased. These findings suggested that Ki20227 blocked microglial
proliferation and aggravated the pathological progression of ischemia/reperfusion injury in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
model. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Lanzhou University Second Hospital (approval No. D2020-68) on March 6,

"Renal interstitial fibrosis is a key factor in the development of chronic renal
diseases, possibly leading to uremia. The present study conducted aimed to assess
the hypothesis whether keratin 1 (KRT1) silencing could suppress kidney
interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis via the Notch pathway to alleviate
uremic symptoms. Differentially expressed genes associated with uremia were
identified using the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Uremic rat models
were established, in which short hairpin‐RNA against KRT1, activators, and
inhibitors of the Notch pathway were transfected. To further validate the
mechanism of KRT1 in uremia, KRT1 expression, cell apoptosis, glomerular area
(GA), and glomerular capillary volume (GV), the score of glomerular sclerosis, and
tubulointerstitial injury were assayed and investigated. GEO database revealed
that KRT1 was upregulated in uremia and regulated the Notch pathway. GA, GV,
cell apoptosis, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury were typically
located in more elevated levels of uremia in rats. KRT1 silencing and Notch
pathway inhibition decreased the expression of Jagged1, Notch1, NICD1, Hey1,
Hes1, α‐SMA, and FN, which further resulted in decreased cell apoptosis, GA, GV,
the score of glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury. Subsequently,
the effect of KRT1 silencing on uremia was no longer evident once the Notch
pathway was activated. The co‐localization of high expression KRT1 and Notch1
was found in uremia. In summary, the results identified KRT1 as a key regulator in
uremia progression, and KRT1 silencing can suppress glomerular sclerosis and
tubulointerstitial injury via inactivation of the Notch pathway in uremic rats.",0
"Retinoblastoma is an ocular malignancy occurring in childhood. The current
study evaluates the ability of silenced PRC1 on retinoblastoma cell proliferation,
and angiogenesis via the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. A total of 36 cases of
retinoblastoma tissues (n = 36) and normal retinal tissues (n = 10) were selected
in the current study. Retinoblastoma cells presenting with the high PRC1
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were selected among the WERI‐Rb‐1,
HXO‐RB44, Y79, SO‐Rb50, and SO‐Rb70 cells lines, and were transfected with
siRNA‐PRC1 and LiCl (the activator of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway). The
expressions of PRC1, VEGF, Wnt1, β‐catenin, CyclinD1, extent of β‐catenin,
and GSK‐3β phosphorylation were evaluated. Cell proliferation, cell‐cycle
distribution, and cell invasion of retinoblastoma cells were evaluated by
3‐(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, and Transwell assay. The angiogenesis of retinoblastoma cells was
detected by tube formation assay. HXO‐RB44 and WERI‐Rb‐1 cells were
selected owing to the highest PRC1 mRNA expression. Meanwhile, PRC2 gene
silencing presented lower expression levels of PRC1, VEGF, Wnt1, β‐catenin,
CyclinD1, extent of β‐catenin and GSK‐3β phosphorylation, decreased
proliferation and invasion abilities, extended G0/G1 phase, and shortened S
and G2/M phases of HXO‐RB44 and WERI‐Rb‐1 cells, suggesting the silenced
PRC2 inactivated Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, so as to further restrain the
retinoblastoma cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. These results
support the view that PRC1 gene silencing could suppress the proliferation, and
angiogenesis of retinoblastoma cells by repressing the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway.",0
"Long noncoding RNA Breast Cancer Antiestrogen Resistance 4 (BCAR4) has been
identified to be oncogenic in several cancers. In our study, we demonstrated that
BCAR4 expression was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared with
paired nontumor tissues. In addition, higher BCAR4 level was associated with poor
overall survival in patients with glioma. Besides, we also discovered that knockdown
of BCAR4 inhibited cell proliferation, whereas BCAR4 overexpression promoted this
process. Intriguingly, we proved a cellular transformation of normal human astrocyte
cells (NHAs) in response to enforced expression of BCAR4. In addition, we revealed
that BCAR4 affected cell proliferation in glioma cells by promoting cell cycle
progression and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we uncovered that BCAR4
activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in glioma through upregulating EGFR and
interacting with it. Moreover, activating PI3K/AKT pathway could reverse the
repressive effects caused by BCAR4 silence on the biological behaviors of glioma
cells, whereas inhibition of this pathway rescued the impact of BACR4 upregulation in
NHAs. These findings disclosed that BCAR4 contributes to glioma progression by
enhancing cell growth via activating EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, providing potent
evidence that BCAR4 could be an effective new target for treatment and prognosis of
glioma patients",0
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the commonest human cancers and the fourth
primary cause of cancer‐related death. Previous studies have reported that miR‐
4429 develops anticancer function in follicular thyroid carcinoma and non‐small cell
lung cancer. However, whether miR‐4429 is implicated in the CRC progression
remains to be clarified. The aim of our current study was to explore the potential
role of miR‐4429 in CRC. According to the result of quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction analysis, miR‐4429 was expressed at a low level in CRC cells.
Gain‐of‐function assays showed that the upregulation of miR‐4429 inhibited cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
process in CRC, whereas miR‐4429 inhibition led to the opposite results. It was
uncovered from mechanism experiments that miR‐4429 targeted forkhead box M1
(FOXM1) and therefore regulating SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) expression.
Rescue experiments elucidated that miR‐4429 influenced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT process in CRC by targeting FOXM1 to inactivate SMAD3.
In conclusion, our study revealed that miR‐4429 targeted FOXM1 to decrease
SMAD3 expression and thus impeding cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
EMT process of CRC cells.",0
"Uremia largely results from the accumulation of organic waste products normally
cleared by the kidneys, which commonly accompanies kidney failure and chronic
kidney disease. However, genetic investigations in a uremia remain largely unclear.
This study aimed to determine the expression patterns of distal‐less homeobox 5
(DLX5) in uremia rat model and further to study its effects on glomerulosclerosis and
interstitial fibrosis. Uremic expression chip was applied to screen differentially
expressed genes in uremia. Next, we used small interfering RNA‐mediated RNA
interference to specifically silence DLX5 in experimental uremic rats to understand
the regulatory mechanism of DLX5. To understand effect of Notch1 signaling
pathway in uremia, we also treated experimental uremic rats with γ‐secretase
inhibitor (GSI), an inhibitor of Notch1 signaling pathway. The expression of
fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN), transforming growth factor‐β1 (TGF‐β1), Hes1, Hes5,
and Jagged2 was determined. The semiquantitative assessment was applied to verify
the effects of DLX5 on glomerulosclerosis. In the uremic expression chip, we found
that DLX5 was upregulated in uremia samples, and considered to regulate the Notch
signaling pathway. We found that small interfering RNA‐mediated DLX5 inhibition or
Notch1 signaling pathway inhibitory treatment relieved and delayed the kidney injury
and glomerulosclerosis in uremia. Meanwhile, inhibition of DLX5 or Nothch1 signaling
pathway reduced expression of FN, LN, Nothch1, TGF‐β1, Hes1, Hes5, and Jagged2.
Intriguingly, we discovered that Notch1 signaling pathway was inhibited after
silencing DLX5. In conclusion, these findings highlight that DLX5 regulates Notch
signaling, which may, in turn, promote complications of uremia such as kidney fibrosis,
providing a novel therapeutic target for treating uremia.",0
"Cardiac rupture and ventricular remodeling are recognized as the severe complications and major risk factors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study aims to
evaluate the regulatory roles of interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase 3 (IRAK3)
and nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) signaling pathway in cardiac rupture and ventricular
remodeling. Microarray analysis was performed to screen AMI‐related differentially
expressed genes and IRAK3 was identified. The models of AMI were established in
male C57BL/6 mice to investigate the functional role of IRAK3. Afterwards, lentivirus
recombinant plasmid si‐IRAK3 was constructed for IRAK3 silencing. Next, cardiac
function parameters were measured in response to IRAK3 silencing. The regulatory
effects that IRAK3 had on myocardial infarct size and the content of myocardial
interstitial collagen were analyzed. The regulation of IRAK3 silencing on the NF‐κB
signaling pathway was further assayed. The obtained results indicated that highly
expressed IRAK3 and activated NF‐κB signaling pathway were observed in
myocardial tissues of mouse models of AMI, accompanied by increased expression
of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐2/9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2
(TIMP‐2). Notably, IRAK3 gene silencing inhibited the activation of NF‐κB signaling
pathway. Furthermore, IRAK3 gene silencing led to the decreased thickness of infarct
area and collagen content of myocardial interstitium, alleviated diastolic, and systolic
dysfunctions, as well as, facilitated cardiac functions in mice with AMI, corresponding
to decreased expression of MMP‐2/9 expression and increased expression of TIMP‐2.
Taken together, silencing of IRAK3 inactivates the NF‐κB signaling pathway, and
thereby impeding the cardiac rupture and ventricular remodeling, which eventually
prevents AMI progression.",0
"Purpose: Investigation of surface dose rate variation with respect to the source configuration of 106Ru/106Rh eye
plaque. To explore an alternate way to determine activity of brachytherapy plaques.
Methods: The surface dose rates of 106Ru/106Rh plaque developed indigenously were measured by extrapolation
chamber. To rule out possibility of any error in the activity distribution and quantity, same source was used in
two different configurations namely planar and curved. EBT3 Gafchromic film was used for determination of
uniformity in activity. Monte Carlo-based Codes EGSnrc and FLUKA were used to calculate dose rate in tissue,
percentage depth dose and for determination of activity. Parameters and correction factors were estimated using
simulations.
Results: The measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved 106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to
be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28 mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate of
curved eye plaque is about ~5% as compared to planar configuration.
The FLUKA-calculated dose values are almost independent of cavity length of the extrapolation chamber for both
eye plaques. The FLUKA-based dose rates per μCi 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08 mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06
mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye plaques which match well with the measurements. The calculated
activities for planar and curved eye plaques are 34.08 μCi and 33.98 μCi, respectively.
Conclusions: Surface dose rates for a prototype 106Ru/106Rh eye plaque with different configurations were esti
mated using simulations and measured experimentally. An alternate way to determine activity of beta-gamma
brachytherapy plaque has been proposed.",0

          Purpose
          This study aims to compare the efficacy of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) versus conventional TACE (cTACE), both combined with apatinib, and to establish predictive nomograms to support individualized survival prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
        
        
          Patients and Methods
          This retrospective study assessed HCC patients from June 2015 to December 2019. Patients were classified as DEB-TACE plus apatinib (D-apatinib) and cTACE plus apatinib (c-apatinib). The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The nomograms were constructed, and the C-index, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration curves were used to validate the nomograms. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was applied to reduce patient selection bias.
        
        
          Results
          A total of 174 patients were included. After PSM analysis, 58 pairs of patients were selected. Before PSM analysis, the median OS and PFS were 21.0 and 8.0 months in the D-apatinib group, respectively, which were better than the 18.0 and 5.0 months observed in the c-apatinib group (P < 0.05). The complete response (CR) rate and objective response rate (ORR) of the D-apatinib group were higher than those of the c-apatinib group. The C-index values of the nomograms in the D-apatinib group and the c-apatinib group were 0.826 and 0.802, and the area under the curve (AUC) values in the ROC curve were 0.934 and 0.892. After PSM analysis, the survival of patients treated with D-apatinib was better than that of patients treated with c-apatinib (P < 0.05). The C-index values were 0.854 and 0.794 in the D-apatinib group and the c-apatinib group, respectively, and the AUC values were 0.960 and 0.890. The incidence of adverse events was higher in the c-apatinib group.
        
        
          Conclusion
          DEB-TACE in combination with apatinib showed better treatment effectiveness for unresectable HCC. The nomograms can identify HCC patients who may benefit most from the treatment.

" Background: The use of robotic surgery in bariatric patients is controversial.
Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of robotic surgery in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)
patients.
Setting: Tertiary-care referral hospital.
Methods: A total of 149,132 patients who underwent RYGB in the 2015 to 2018 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database were included
in our initial analysis. The propensity-matched analysis that was performed resulted in 21,736 patients, whose data were utilized to compare outcomes of the robotic (R) and laparoscopic (L) groups.
Patients were also compared after dividing them into obese (body mass index [BMI] , 50 kg/m2
) and
super-obese categories (BMI _x0001_ 50 kg/m2
).
Results: R-RYGB patients had a significantly lower 30-day incidence of serious adverse events
(SAEs) and bleeding (2.0% and .7%, respectively, for R-RYGB versus 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively,
for L-RYGB; P  .05) but a higher incidence of 30-day reoperation compared to L-RYGB patients
(2.7% versus 2.3%, respectively; P .05). The R-RYGB group also had a shorter length of hospital
stay compared to the L-RYGB group (1.98 versus 2.02 days, respectively; P .05), but higher readmission rates (7.1% versus 5.8%, respectively; P .05). The robotic approach also resulted in lower
mortality rates for those in the super-obese category. In that BMI category, 30-day mortality rates
were .4% versus .2% for L-RYGB and R-RYGB patients, respectively (P  .05).
Conclusion: The use of robotic surgery in bariatric patients is controversial. Our analysis, based on the
MBSAQIP database for the years 2015 to 2018, demonstrated lower overall SAEs and bleeding rates, in
addition to a shorter hospital stay, favoring robotic RYGB compared to laparoscopic RYGB. However, readmission and reoperation rates were higher in the robotic group. Randomized controlled trials are needed to
further clarify the benefit of robotic surgery in bariatric patients. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2021;17:694–

"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Skin cancer severely threatens the public health. Dual-specificity
protein phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) characterizes
with multiple roles regulating cell growth, proliferation and gaining. This study aims to investigate the regulatory role of DUSP22 on aging of
skin cancer cells and clarify molecular mechanisms, along with potential application value.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: HS-1 skin cancer
cells were transfected with DUSP22 by liposome
transfection approach. Western blot assay was
used to evaluate the effects of DUSP22 on aging
protein of HS-1 cells, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK)
signal pathway. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and
Western blot assay were used to examine the
DUSP22 expression in HS-1 cancer cells. Meanwhile, the correlation between P53 protein and
aging was also investigated.
RESULTS: Transfection of DUSP22 plasmid
significantly elevated DUSP22 expression in HS1 skin cancer cells compared to un-transfected
cells (p<0.05), and activated MAPK to induce cell
aging. Transfection of small interfere RNA (siRNA) DUSP22 significantly suppressed DUSP22
expression in HS-1 cancer cells, inhibited MAPK
signal pathway, and decreased aging proteins
P53 and P21 compared to the untreated group
(p<0.05). DUSP22 was downregulated in HS-1
skin cancer cells, with MAPK signal pathway
inhibition, and lower aging protein P53 expression. DUSP22 expression was positively correlated with aging protein P53 (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DUSP22 facilitated HS-1
skin cancer cell aging via activating MAPK signal pathway, possibly providing novel strategy

"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Vascular dementia
(VD) is a type of memory, cognition, and behavior disorder caused by ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. It is a common pathogenesis of
dementia that is only second to Alzheimer’s disease. Inflammation plays a key role in VD. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a kind of pro-inflammatory cytokine, while its mechanism in VD occurrence and
development is still unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The healthy male
rats were randomly divided into three groups, including sham group, VD model group (established by bilateral common carotid artery ligation),
and IL-1β group (treated by IL-1β monoclonal antibody intracerebroventricular injection on based
on model group). Rat learning ability was evaluated by Morris water maze assay. IL-1β expression
in brain tissue and peripheral blood was examined
by using Real Time-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Hippocampus apoptosis was detected by caspase 3 activity detection kit. B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein levels were assessed by Western blot assay.
RESULTS: IL-1β expression was increased,
caspase 3 activity was enhanced, Bcl-2 level
was declined, and p-P38 phosphorylation was
elevated in brain tissue and peripheral blood
from VD model group compared to sham group
(p<0.05). IL-1β monoclonal antibody significantly reduced IL-1β expression, improved learning
ability, attenuated caspase 3 activity, increased
Bcl-2 level, and declined p-P38 expression in VD
rats compared to model group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-1β can delay VD occurrence and development through the P38-MAPK
signaling pathway to regulate cell apoptosis and
improve learning ability",0
"The performance of the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) approach to simulate typical photodissociation processes is assessed. The correct description of photodissociation requires the calculation of correlation functions or expectation values associated with nonequilibrium initial conditions, which was shown to be possible with RPMD very recently [J.

This approach is combined with treatment of the nonadiabatic dynamics employing the ring polymer surface hopping approach (RPSH), which is based on Tully’s fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) approach. The performance is tested using one-dimensional photodissociation models. It is found that RPSH with non-equilibrium initial conditions can well reproduce the time-dependent dissociation probability, and adiabatic and diabatic populations for cases where the crossing point is below and above the Franck-Condon point, respectively, while standard FSSH fails to reproduce the exact quantum dynamics in the latter case. Thus, it is shown that RPSH is an efficient and accurate alternative to standard FSSH, which is one of the most widely employed approaches to study photochemistry.

"Background: Apoptosis and oxidative stress are the main etiology of age related cataract (ARC). This article aims to
investigate the role of WRN in lens epithelial cells (LECs).
Methods: We estimated the methylation level of WRN in anterior lens capsule tissues of ARC patients. SRA01/04 (LECs)
cells were treated with H2O2 or combined with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) or chloroquine. CCK8 and flow
cytometry were performed to explore proliferation and apoptosis. The content of ROS was detected by fluorescent
probe DCFH-DA. The gene and protein expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR or western blot.
Results: WRN was down-regulated and the methylation level of WRN was increased in the anterior lens capsule
tissues. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR enhanced proliferation and repressed apoptosis and oxidative stress of
SRA01/04 cells. 5-Aza-CdR enhanced WRN expression. WRN knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis
and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells, which was rescued by 5-Aza-CdR. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR repressed
ATM/p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, chloroquine inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative
stress of SRA01/04 cells by activating ATM/p53 signaling pathway. The influence conferred by chloroquine was
abolished by WRN overexpression.
Conclusion: Our study reveals that DNA methylation mediated WRN inhibits apoptosis and oxidative stress of human
LECs through ATM/p53 signaling pathway.

"Objective: This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies on COVID-19.
Methods: Relevant literatures about GM-CSF antibody treatment in COVID-19 patients were
searched from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google scholar, and Baiduscholar
databases from the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 until 1 January 2021. The primary
outcomes included the death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission risk, ventilation requirement,
and secondary infection.
Results: A total of 12 eligible literature involving 8979 COVID-19 patients were recruited,
and they were divided into experimental group (n=2673) and control group (n=6306). Using a
random-effect model, it is found that the GM-CSF antibody treatment was associated with a
23% decline of the risk of death [odd’s ratio (OR): 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21–0.56,
p<0.0001] and a 20% enhancement of ventilation (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.80, p=0.0002).
GM-CSF antibody treatment did not have a significant correlation to secondary infection and
increased risk of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients, which may be attributed to the older age
and the length of stay.
Conclusions: Severe COVID-19 patients can benefit from GM-CSF antibodies",0
"No specifc antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efcacy
of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19. This was a multicenter randomized controlled study including 96 patients with
COVID- 19 who were randomly assigned into a chloroquine (CQ) group and a favipiravir group. None of the patients in the
favipiravir group needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.129). One patient (2.3%) in the favipiravir group and two patients
(4.2%) in the CQ group died (p = 1.00). Favipiravir is a promising drug for COVID-19 that decreases the hospital stay and
the need for mechanical ventilation.

"Circadian rhythms modulate the biology of many human tissues, including brain tissues, and are driven by a near 24-hour
transcriptional feedback loop. These rhythms are paralleled by 24-hour rhythms of large portions of the transcriptome. The
role of dynamic DNA methylation in influencing these rhythms is uncertain. While recent work in Neurospora suggests that
dynamic site-specific circadian rhythms of DNA methylation may play a role in modulating the fungal molecular clock, such
rhythms and their relationship to RNA expression have not, to our knowledge, been elucidated in mammalian tissues,
including human brain tissues. We hypothesized that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation exist in the human brain, and
play a role in driving 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in post-mortem human
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 738 subjects. We assessed for 24-hour rhythmicity of 420,132 DNA methylation
sites throughout the genome by considering methylation levels as a function of clock time of death and parameterizing
these data using cosine functions. We determined global statistical significance by permutation. We then related rhythms of
DNA methylation with rhythms of RNA expression determined by RNA sequencing. We found evidence of significant 24-
hour rhythmicity of DNA methylation. Regions near transcription start sites were enriched for high-amplitude rhythmic DNA
methylation sites, which were in turn time locked to 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression of nearby genes, with the nadir of
methylation preceding peak transcript expression by 1–3 hours. Weak ante-mortem rest-activity rhythms were associated
with lower amplitude DNA methylation rhythms as were older age and the presence of Alzheimer’s disease. These findings
support the hypothesis that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation, particularly near transcription start sites, may play a role
in driving 24-hour rhythms of gene expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and may be affected by age and
Alzheimer’s disease.",0
"Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder, but the
mechanisms that underlie this are not well characterized. Here, we show that kappa opioid
receptor signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical molecular substrate
underlying abnormal stress responses to predator odor following heavy alcohol drinking. Exposure
to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in
enhanced prefrontal cortex (PFC)-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the
BNST. Furthermore, deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFCBNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice. These
findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral
responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal. Various nodes of this PFC-BNST
dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well
as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking.",0
": In order to assist the refolding of recombinant
nitrilase inclusion bodies, a series of thermoresponsive media were
prepared by grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl-methacrylate) [P(NIPAM-co-BMA)] brushes onto PS microspheres with
various particles and pore sizes via an atom transfer radical
polymerization (ATRP) method. The effects of particle sizes, pore
sizes, and brush grafting amounts of thermoresponsive microspheres on nitrilase refolding were investigated preliminarily. The
results showed that the PS-P(NIPAM-co-BMA) microspheres with
the medium particle size (74 μm), gigapore size (320 nm), and
high grafting amount (35.6 mg/m2
) were the most effective candidates. The final nitrilase activity yield could be up to 84.5% with a
high initial protein concentration (1 mg/mL) at 30 °C, which was 52.5% higher than that of a simple dilution refolding method at
the initial protein concentration (0.1 mg/mL). After the refolding process, the PS-P(NIPAM-co-BMA) microspheres can be easily
separated by self-precipitation, and the activity yield of nitrilase still reached 74.5% after being reused for five batches. These results
indicated that the thermoresponsive gigaporous medium was an ideal alternative as an artificial chaperone.",0
"In humans, one of the major factors associated with infective endocarditis (IE) is the concurrent presence of periodontal disease (PD). However, in veterinary medicine, the relevance
of PD in the evolution of dogs’ endocarditis remains poorly understood. In order to try to
establish a correlation between mouth-associated Enterococcus spp. and infective endocarditis in dogs, the present study evaluated the presence and diversity of enterococci in
the gum and heart of dogs with PD. Samples were collected during necropsy of 32 dogs
with PD and visually diagnosed with IE, which died of natural causes or euthanasia. Enterococci were isolated, identified and further characterized by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE); susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and pathogenicity potential was also
evaluated. In seven sampled animals, PFGE-patterns, resistance and virulence profiles
were found to be identical between mouth and heart enterococci obtained from the same
dog, allowing the establishment of an association between enterococcal periodontal disease and endocarditis in dogs. These findings represent a crucial step towards understanding the pathogenesis of PD-driven IE, and constitute a major progress in veterinary
medicine.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Tumor-derived exosomes have been repeatedly studied as tumor antigens, suppressing T-cell signaling molecules and promoting apoptosis in ovarian cancer (OC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
have been recognized as major regulators in tumorigenesis, including OC. For this study, we
try to find out the mechanism of exosomes and
lncRNA FAL1 in OC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the extraction and identification of exosomes, the internalization of exosomes was observed. Invasion and migration experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of SKOV3 cells-secreted exosomes on OC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, the in vivo findings were
verified via xenograft tumors in nude mice. FAL1
was knocked out on exosomes. OC cells treated
with exosomes were co-cultured with lncRNA
FAL1 or/and PTEN to measure cell invasion and
migration.
RESULTS: SKOV3-secreted exosomes were
absorbed and internalized by OC cells. After
exosome treatment, the migration and invasion of OC cells were enhanced, tumors in
nude mice were larger and heavier, metastasis was increased, and lncRNA FAL1 expression was increased. When lncRNA FAL1 was
knocked out, the promoting effects of SKOV3
cells-secreted exosomes on OC cell metastasis were weakened, along with increased PTEN
level and decreased AKT phosphorylation level. In HO-8910PM cells treated with siRNA-FAL1
exosomes and siRNA-PTEN, cell invasion and
migration, and AKT phosphorylation were restored.
CONCLUSIONS: SKOV3-secreted exosomes
inhibited the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway by
transferring lncRNA FAL1, thus inhibiting OC
cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo.",0

        Molecular crystals are not known to be as stiff as metals, composites and ceramics. Here we report an exceptional mechanical stiffness and high hardness in a known elastically bendable organic cocrystal [caffeine (CAF), 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid (CNB) and methanol (1:1:1)] which is comparable to certain low-density metals. Spatially resolved atomic level studies reveal that the mechanically interlocked weak hydrogen bond networks which are separated by dispersive interactions give rise to these mechanical properties. Upon bending, the crystals significantly conserve the overall energy by efficient redistribution of stress while perturbations in hydrogen bonds are compensated by strengthened π-stacking. Furthermore we report a remarkable stiffening and hardening in the elastically bent crystal. Hence, mechanically interlocked architectures provide an unexplored route to reach new mechanical limits and adaptability in organic crystals. This proof of concept inspires the design of light-weight, stiff crystalline organics with potential to rival certain inorganics, which currently seem inconceivable.

          To compare the efficacy and complications between reconstruction nail and hollow screw+plate in patients with femoral shaft and femoral neck fracture.
        
        
          Methods
          The full text of studies on clinical efficacy involving reconstruction nail and hollow screw+plate was retrieved from multiple databases. Review Manager 5.0 was adopted for meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted with respect to the operation time, blood loss, healing time of the femoral shaft, healing time of the femoral neck, and complications. Finally, 10 studies met the eligibility criteria, including 991 patients.
        
        
          Results
          The meta-analysis suggested better characteristics for the reconstruction nail compared with the hollow screw+plate regarding operation time (OR = − 82.41, 95% CI [− 91.72, − 73.10], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity < 0.00001, I2 = 98%), blood loss (OR = − 388.01, 95% CI [− 422.95, − 353.06], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity < 0.00001, I2 = 99%), healing time of femoral shaft (MD = − 3.89, 95% CI [− 4.74, − 3.05], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity < 0.00001, I2 = 99%), healing time of femoral neck (MD = − 4.04, 95% CI [− 4.33, − 3.75], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity = 0.008, I2 = 60%), and complications (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.31, 0.73], P = 0.0006; P for heterogeneity = 1.00, I2 = 0%).

"The present study examined the roles of word concreteness and word valence in
the immediate serial recall task. Emotion words (e.g. happy) were used to investigate
these effects. Participants completed study-test trials with seven-item study lists
consisting of positive or negative words with either high or low concreteness
(Experiments 1 and 2) and neutral (i.e. non-emotion) words with either high or low
concreteness (Experiment 2). For neutral words, the typical word concreteness
effect (concrete words are better recalled than abstract words) was replicated. For
emotion words, the effect occurred for positive words, but not for negative
words. While the word concreteness effect was stronger for neutral words than
for negative words, it was not different for the neutral words and the positive
words. We conclude that both word valence and word concreteness simultaneously
contribute to the item and order retention of emotion words and discuss
how Hulme et al.’s (1997) item redintegration account can be modified to explain
these findings.",0
"In English, unfair treatment and social injustice are often described as “bitter”
experiences, but in Chinese “eating bitterness” refers to endurance in the face of
hardship. We tested the influence of these metaphors by assessing Canadian and
Chinese participants’ responses to a fairness and an achievement scenario after
incidental exposure to a bitter, sweet or neutral taste. A bitter taste experience
increased Chinese (but not Canadian) participants’ judgments of effort and
motivation in the face of hardship (Study 1). Bitter taste also increased perceptions
of unfairness for Canadian participants (Studies 1-3) as well as Chinese
participants who lived in Canada, provided they were tested in English (Studies 1
and 3) rather than Chinese (Study 3); it did not influence fairness perceptions of
Chinese participants who had never lived in an English speaking country (Study 2).
Bitter food is rejected by most people, presumably because it is associated
with toxins, which makes its avoidance adaptive (Desor, Maller & Andrews 1975;
Glendinning, 1994). Nevertheless, bitter taste plays an important role in Chinese
cuisine (Newman, 2004) and bitter tea is considered the soul of Chinese drink
(Evans, 1992). In Chinese sayings, bitterness is associated metaphorically with
concepts related to adversity. Chi-Ku (“eating bitterness”) means “to endure a
hardship,” “to overcome difficulties,” and “to forge ahead” (Loyalka, 2012).
Chinese children are taught to embrace the experience of Chi-Ku (eat their
bitterness) because it is considered a necessary step on the road to success, as
illustrated by sayings such as “only via eating bitterness can you surpass your
peers.” Compatible with this link between bitter taste and hardship, Chen and
Chang (2012) observed that a bitter taste experience increased the accessibility and
retention of survival related words for Chinese participants.
This metaphorical meaning of bitter taste is uncommon in the English
language and largely unfamiliar to Americans and Canadians. Instead, English
speakers use the term bitter to describe a negative experience that results from
unfair treatment or injustice (Oxford Dictionary, n.d). This link is exemplified by a
famous quote from Emmeline Pankhurst, an early British feminist leader, who
observed, “I have not personally suffered from the deprivations, the bitterness and
sorrow which bring so many men and women to a realization of social injustice.” 
These observations suggest an association between bitter taste and endurance of
hardship in Chinese (but not in Canadian) culture and between bitter taste and
injustice in Canadian (but not in Chinese) culture.
The present studies test whether these cultural differences in metaphors have
downstream consequences: Does tasting something bitter influence Chinese (but
not Canadian) participants’ judgments of endurance and Canadian (but not Chinese)
participants’ judgments of injustice? We further test whether such cultural
differences fade during extended exposure to the other culture and whether such
acculturation effects depend on the language in which participants are tested.",0
"Background
A number of preclinical studies in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease have demonstrated that coenzyme Q10 can protect the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Some clinical trials have looked at the neuroprotective effects of coenzyme Q10 in patients with early and midstage Parkinson's disease.

Objectives
To assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of treatment with coenzyme Q10 compared to placebo in patients with early and midstage Parkinson's disease.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Movment Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2011), and EMBASE (January 1985 to March 2011). We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, congress reports from the most important neurological association and movement disorder societies in Europe and America (March 2011), checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers.

Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared coenzyme Q10 to placebo for patients who suffered early and midstage primary Parkinson's disease. Studies in which the method of randomization or concealment were unknown were included. Cross‐over studies were excluded.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All disagreements were resolved by consensus between authors and were explained. We attempted to contact the authors of studies for further details if any data were missing and to establish the characteristics of unpublished trials through correspondence with the trial coordinator or principal investigator. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

Main results
Four randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials with a total of 452 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. In overall, there were improvements in activities of daily living (ADL) UPDRS (WMD ‐3.12, 95% CI ‐5.88 to ‐0.36) and Schwab and England (WMD 4.43, 95% CI 0.05 to 8.81) for coenzyme Q10 at 1200 mg/d for 16 months versus placebo.

In safety outcomes, only the risk ratios (RR) of pharyngitis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.89) and diarrhea (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.16) are mild elevated between coenzyme Q10 therapy and placebo and there were no differences in the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.62).

Authors' conclusions
Coenzyme Q10 therapy with 1200 mg/d for 16 months was well tolerated by patients with Parkinson's disease. The improvements in ADL UPDRS and Schwab and England were positive, but it need to be further confirmed by larger sample. For total and other subscores of UPDRS, the effects of coenzyme Q10 seemed to be less clear.",0
" Cervical cancer is known as the possible outcome of genital infection, while the molecular mechanisms of initiation, development, and metastasis of cervical cancer have not yet been fully elucidated. Our study aims to investigate the effects of microRNA‐92a (miR‐92a) on tumor growth and immune function by targeting PTEN 
via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in tumor‐bearing mice. C57BL/6 female mice were used for tumor‐bearing mouse models and their tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected, and normal cervical tissues were obtained from normal mice. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) and soluble interleukin‐2 receptor (sIL‐2R) were detected by ELISA. The cells were divided into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), miR‐92a mimic, miR‐92a inhibitor, siRNA‐PTEN, and miR‐92a inhibitor + siRNA‐PTEN groups. Dual‐luciferase reporter assay was adopted to determine the relationship between PTEN and miR‐92a. Expressions of miR‐92a, PTEN, TNF‐α, sIL‐2R, ERK1, and ERK2 were tested by RT‐qPCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was detected by cell count kit‐8 (
CCK‐8); cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Compared with the normal cervical tissues and adjacent normal tissues, the cervical cancer tissues exhibited increased expressions of miR‐92a, p‐ERK1/2, and serum levels of TNF‐α and sIL‐2R while decreased PTEN expression. PTEN was confirmed to be the target gene of miR‐92a. As compared with the blank and NC groups, expressions of miR‐92a, ERK1 and ERK2 increased, and expressions of PTEN decreased in the miR‐92a mimic group. The miR‐92a mimic group exhibited increased expression levels of TNF‐α and sIL‐2R, cell proliferation, and cell number in S phase but decreased cell apoptosis, and cell number in G0/G1 phase, while the miR‐92a inhibitor group followed opposite trends. miR‐92a promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune function by inhibiting PTEN 
via activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in mice bearing U14 cervical cancer.

"Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) at its early stages remains a challenge for modern clinicians. In
this study, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to address this problem. In particular, we
develop a CNN-based network model highly capable of discriminating PD patients based on Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy controls. A total of 2723 SPECT images are analyzed
in this study, of which 1364 images from the healthy control group, and the other 1359 images are in the PD
group. Image normalization process is carried out to enhance the regions of interests (ROIs) necessary for our
network to learn distinguishing features from them. A 10-fold cross-validation is implemented to evaluate the
performance of the network model. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance with an accuracy of
99.34 %, sensitivity of 99.04 % and specificity of 99.63 %, outperforming all previously published results. Given
the high performance and easy-to-use features of our network, it can be deduced that our approach has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of PD and its management.",0
"Background In randomized studies, the strategy of pulmonary vein antral isolation (PVI) plus linear ablation has failed
to increase success rates for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF) ablation when compared with PVI alone. Peri-mitral reentry
related atrial tachycardia due to incomplete linear block is an important cause of clinical failures of a first ablation procedure.
Ethanol infusion (EI) into the vein of Marshall (EI-VOM) has been demonstrated to facilitate a durable mitral isthmus linear
lesion.
Objective This trial is designed to compare arrhythmia-free survival between PVI and an ablation strategy termed
upgraded ‘2C3L’ for the ablation of PeAF.
Study Design The PROMPT-AF study (clinicaltrials.gov 04497376) is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial using a 1:1 parallel-control approach. Patients (n = 498) undergoing their first catheter ablation of PeAF will be
randomized to either the upgraded ‘2C3L’ arm or PVI arm in a 1:1 fashion. The upgraded ‘2C3L’ technique is a fixed ablation approach consisting of EI-VOM, bilateral circumferential PVI, and 3 linear ablation lesion sets across the mitral isthmus,
left atrial roof, and cavotricuspid isthmus. The follow-up duration is 12 months. The primary end point is freedom from atrial
arrhythmias of >30 seconds, without antiarrhythmic drugs, in 12 months after the index ablation procedure (excluding a
blanking period of 3 months).
Conclusions The PROMPT-AF study will evaluate the efficacy of the fixed ‘2C3L’ approach in conjunction with EI-VOM,
compared with PVI alone, in patients with PeAF undergoing de novo ablation. (Am Heart J 2023;260:34–43.)",0
"Multifarious biological functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been
reported in various cancers including bladder cancer (BCa). This study aims to
determine the biological role of a certain lncRNA in BCa. Consistent with the data of
The Cancer Genome Atlas database, it was validated that lncRNA HLA complex group
22 (HCG22) was weakly expressed in BCa samples and lowly expressed HCG22 was
closely correlated with low overall survival of the BCa patient. To verify the role of
HCG22 in BCa progression, functional experiments were carried out in two
representative BCa cells (J82 and T24) and the negative effects of HCG22 expression
on the cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition were
identified. Mechanistically, polypyrimidine tract‐binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which was
highly expressed in BCa tissues and cell lines, was negatively regulated by HCG22
and the PTBP1‐mediated Warburg effect was also obstructed by HCG22.
Furthermore, HCG22 modulated the expression of PTBP1 through destabilizing
human antigen R (HuR). And functional rescue assays confirmed that HCG22
functioned in bladder cancer through downregulating PTBP1. In conclusion, the
present study revealed that HCG22 inhibited BCa progression via the HuR/PTBP1
axis, opening new prospects for potent therapeutic regimens for BCa patients.",0
"The present study examined how the format in which treatment information is presented impacts individuals’ preferences for posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) treatments. Adults who screened positive for PTSD (N = 301) were randomized into groups to learn about
five first-line treatments; participants either read sequential text descriptions or reviewed a comparison chart that presented side-by-side
information. Participants rated treatment acceptability, rank ordered treatments from most to least preferred, and indicated their confidence
in this ranking. Compared with participants in the text group, those in the chart group assigned more favorable acceptability ratings
to prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and more moderate ratings to medications. Cognitive processing therapy was the most common
first-choice treatment (43.6%). Forced-choice treatment rankings were similar across conditions, although participants in the chart group
ranked PE more favorably than those in the text group, odds ratio (OR) = 0.54, 95% CI [0.35, 0.82], p = .004. Confidence in treatment
rankings did not differ across conditions. The results suggest that perceptions of treatment acceptability can be influenced by the format in
which treatment information is presented. In settings where the goal is to increase treatment acceptability, side-by-side formats may offer
an advantage over sequential descriptions of each treatment.

"Firearm injuries are one of the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality among children. Limited information exists about the impact of nonfatal firearm
injuries on utilization and expenditures. Our objective was to compare health care
encounters and expenditures 1 year before and 1 year following a nonfatal firearm

This was a retrospective cohort study of children 0 to 18 years with ICD-9/ICD-10

2  PULCINI et a. |   
BACKGROUND
Firearm injuries are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children.1-4
 In 2018, there were an estimated 11,141
emergency department (ED) visits for nonfatal firearm injuries
in the United States among children aged 0 to 18 years of age.5
Despite the high incidence of such injuries, little is known about the
overall health care utilization and costs associated with nonfatal injuries among children. Furthermore, even less is known in regard to
health and expenditure outcomes after an initial nonfatal childhood
firearm injury.
Previous research has attempted to characterize the health outcomes and health care expenditures of firearm injuries among young
adults opposed to children and adolescents. These studies are limited
by a host of factors that limit their generalizability (e.g., performed at
a single site) and only include estimates of utilization and/or cost at
the time of injury without a more longitudinal approach.6-9
 A recent
study by Ranney et al.10 describes significant utilization increases and
expenditures among all age groups after a firearm injury compared
to before. This study, however, had a limited number of children (133
under the age of 15 and 333 aged 15–19 years), was exclusively focused on privately insured patients, and was limited to 6 months after
the injury.
Based on the limitations of the existing literature, we sought to
compare the health care utilization and expenditures for a large sample of children suffering from a nonfatal firearm injury 1 year before
and 1 year after the injury. We hypothesized that both utilization
and expenditures will increase the year after a firearm injury for all
groups of children, most notably among the children who were previously healthy. Our overall goal was to evaluate the burden of nonfatal childhood firearm injuries on the health care system.
METHODS
Data source and study design
We analyzed data from the Medicaid MarketScan (IBM Watson
Health, Armonk, NY) 2010 to 2016 claims database.11 This database
identifies children enrolled in the Medicaid or the Children's Health
Insurance Program fee-for-service and managed care plans from
10 to 12 states within all geographic regions of the United States.
It includes data on health care expenditures by claim and enrollee
demographic and clinical characteristics that have been aggregated
and prepared for analysis across multiple states.
Study population and diagnostic categories
We included all claims for children 0 to 18 years of age with an
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) claim associated with firearm
injuries from 2010 to 2016 according to Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (Appendix S1, available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper, which is available at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.14252/full). 12
We included those who were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 11
of 12 months before and after the firearm injury to allow for common
coverage gaps that may have occurred among children. We only included individuals whose initial firearm-related claim was from an ED
or inpatient encounter in an attempt to focus the analysis from the
time of the primary event. We identified index injuries by ensuring that
each child did not have a firearm injury diagnosis in the year prior. We
excluded any child who died during this time frame. A CONSORT diagram detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria is included as Figure 1.
We evaluated the cohort in aggregate and by three subgroups
derived by nearest-neighbor clustering preinjury health care expenditures. This analytic technique groups patients based on their
FIGURE 1 Consort diagram

"Objectives To identify the chemicals released in I Quit Ordinary Smoking (IQOS) heat-not-burn tobacco aerosol and to assess their potential human health toxicity.

Methods The heating temperature window of the IQOS heat-not-burn device was determined using a thermographic camera over a period of 100 s. Qualitative studies were performed using a novel real-time gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer set-up. Aerosols from six tobacco-flavoured IQOS HeatSticks (Amber, Blue, Bronze, Sienna, Turquoise and Yellow) were collected in a 1 mL loop via a manual syringe attached to the sample-out port of the valve. The gas transport line was heated to 200°C in order to prevent the condensation of volatile species. Compound identification was performed using the NIST11 mass spectrometry database library (US National Institute of Standards and Technology), where only chemicals with a match of 70% and above were listed as identifiable.

Results The temperature profile of the IQOS device revealed a non-combustive process employed in generating the tobacco aerosol. Real-time qualitative analysis revealed 62 compounds encompassing a broad spectrum of chemicals such as carbonyls, furans and phthalates, which are highly toxic.

Discussion Our findings complement the qualitative studies previously performed by Philip Morris International and others via indirect sampling methods. By analysing the aerosols in real time, we have identified a total of 62 compounds, from which only 10 were in common with previous studies. Several identified species such as diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, hydroxymethylfurfural and diethylhexyl phthalate are classified as highly toxic, with the latter considered carcinogenic.

": We performed a retrospective analysis spanning ten years of pediatric practice focused
on patients with variable vaccination born into a practice, presenting a unique opportunity to
study the effects of variable vaccination on outcomes. The average total incidence of billed office
visits per outcome related to the outcomes were compared across groups (Relative Incidence of
Office Visit (RIOV)). RIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full cohort,
cumulative incidence analyses, matched for days of care, and matched for family history analyses were
conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were
robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family history, gender block, age block, and false discovery
risk. Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care (e.g., anemia
(6.334), asthma (3.496), allergic rhinitis (6.479), and sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test).
Developmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence
in the practice, potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and
family history of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study
had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to 5.3% of the (partially and fully)
vaccinated. The implications of these results for the net public health effects of whole-population
vaccination and with respect for informed consent on human health are compelling. Our results give
agency to calls for research conducted by individuals who are independent of any funding sources
related to the vaccine industry. While the low rates of developmental disorders prevented sufficiently
powered hypothesis testing, it is notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum disorder (0.361%) in
the cohort is one-fifth that of the US national rate (1.851%). The practice-wide rate of ADHD was
roughly half of the national rate. The data indicate that unvaccinated children in the practice are not
unhealthier than the vaccinated and indeed the overall results may indicate that the unvaccinated
pediatric patients in this practice are healthier overall than the vaccinated.",0
"Over the past two decades, the study of moral reasoning has been heavily influenced by Joshua Greene’s dualprocess model of moral judgment, according to which deontological judgments are typically supported by
intuitive, automatic processes while utilitarian judgments are typically supported by reflective, conscious pro
cesses. However, most of the evidence gathered in support of this model comes from the study of people’s
judgments about sacrificial dilemmas, such as Trolley Problems. To which extent does this model generalize to
other debates in which deontological and utilitarian judgments conflict, such as the existence of harmless moral
violations, the difference between actions and omissions, the extent of our duties of assistance, and the appro
priate justification for punishment? To find out, we conducted a series of five studies on the role of reflection in
these kinds of moral conundrums. In Study 1, participants were asked to answer under cognitive load. In Study 2,
participants had to answer under a strict time constraint. In Studies 3 to 5, we sought to promote reflection
through exposure to counter-intuitive reasoning problems or direct instruction. Overall, our results offer strong
support to the extension of Greene’s dual-process model to moral debates on the existence of harmless violations
and partial support to its extension to moral debates on the extent of our duties of assistance.",0

Abstract
In Brief
OBJECTIVE: 
To evaluate characteristics associated with treatment failure 1 year after midurethral sling in women with mixed urinary incontinence.

METHODS: 
Four-hundred three women who participated in a randomized trial that compared midurethral sling and behavioral and pelvic floor muscle therapy (combined group) compared with midurethral sling alone for mixed incontinence with 1-year follow-up data were eligible for this planned secondary analysis. Overall treatment failure was defined as meeting criteria for subjective or objective failure or both. Subjective failure was defined as not meeting the minimal clinical important difference for improvement on the UDI (Urogenital Distress Inventory) total score (26.1 points). Objective failure was defined as not achieving 70% improvement on mean incontinence episodes of any type per day or having undergone any additional treatment for persistent urinary symptoms at 12 months postoperative. Logistic regression models for treatment failure were constructed. Independent variables included site and treatment group, and clinical and demographic variables based on bivariate comparisons (P<.2). Treatment group interaction effects were evaluated.

RESULTS: 
One hundred twelve of 379 (29.6%) women had overall treatment failure, with 56 of 379 (14.7%) undergoing additional treatment but only two needing intervention for stress incontinence. Previous overactive bladder (OAB) medication (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.19, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.17–3.31); detrusor overactivity on cystometrogram (OR 2.25, aOR 2.82, 95% CI 1.60–4.97); and higher volume at first urge (OR 1.03, aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07) were associated with overall failure. Worse UDI-urgency scores were associated with failure, with an added interaction effect in the midurethral sling–alone group.

CONCLUSIONS: 
Certain clinical and urodynamic variables are associated with treatment failure after midurethral sling in women with mixed urinary incontinence. Women with more severe urgency symptoms at baseline may benefit from perioperative behavioral and pelvic floor muscle therapy combined with midurethral sling. Overall, the need for additional urinary treatment was low and primarily for OAB.",0
"Arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 is associated with human breast cancer metastasis.
Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here we identified the pivotal roles of
PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7
exerted its functions through binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of
SHANK2 at R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK
domain blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with SHANK2 on
endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal FAK/cortactin signals in
vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397
phosphorylation and cortactin Y421 phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast
cancer tissues. These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key
player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of SHANK2 R240
methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.",0
"Psychotic disorders are some of the most severe psychiatric conditions. Patients have difficulties in identifying
facial expressions and appear to be highly sensitive to the presence of emotional distractors. Yet, no study has
investigated whether perceptual load modulates the interference of emotional distractors. Our goal was to test
whether psychotic patients were more sensitive to irrelevant emotional stimulus, even when the task demands a
high amount of attentional resources. Twenty-two participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
and twenty-two healthy controls, performed a target letter discrimination task with emotional task-irrelevant
stimulus (angry, happy and neutral facial expressions). Target-letters were presented among distrator-letters,
which could be similar (low perceptual load) or different (high load); participants should discriminate the
target-letter and ignore the facial expression. Results showed that patients were more prone to distraction by
task-irrelevant stimulus, especially under high load, suggesting difficulties in attention control. Moreover, in
psychotic patients, happy faces caused higher interference with the task, whereas neutral and angry faces
resulted in less interference. These findings could provide innovative approaches regarding attentional deficits
on social contexts in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The incidence of
pulmonary adenocarcinoma locates first in all
the malignant tumors in the world. At present,
there are many diagnostic methods for pulmonary adenocarcinoma, but there are a few methods that are mature or have ideal application
prospects. We aim to explore the role of VRK2
in the occurrence and development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma and its possible regulatory mechanism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Western blot and
qRT-PCR were performed to assess the expression of VRK2. Flow cytometry, Western blot, and
Caspase-3 colorimetric assay Kit were used to
evaluate the apoptosis level. The proliferation,
migration, and invasion ability were measured
via cell cycle assay, wound healing, and transwell invasion assay. Luciferase assay verified
the relationship between VRK2 and miR-145-5p.
The effect of FGD5-AS1 on tumorigenesis of glioma was detected by the xenograft nude mice
model.
RESULTS: VRK2 was significantly increased
in tumor tissues and cell lines. Loss of VRK2
promoted apoptosis level and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in A549 cells
via regulating the ERK1/2/AKT signal pathway.
Luciferase assay reported that VRK2 could bind
with miR-145-5p. The level of miR-145-5p was
negatively correlated with the expression of
VRK2 and involved in VRK2 regulating tumor
progression. The tumor growth assay showed
that the silencing of VRK2 inhibited tumorigenesis with the inactivating ERK1/2/AKT pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of VRK2 inhibited the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma via regulating the ERK1/2/AKT signal
pathway by targeting miR-145-5p, which providing some novel experimental basis for clinical
treatment of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.",0

"""PurposeDegenerative retinal diseases are characterized by inflammation and microglial activation. The nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), is an anti-inflammatory in models of diabetes and glaucoma. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that retinal inflammation and microglia activation are initiated and sustained by oxidative stress and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and that CBD reduces inflammation by blocking these processes.
          MethodsMicroglial cells were isolated from retinas of newborn rats. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were estimated with ELISA. Nitric oxide (NO) was determined with a NO analyzer. Superoxide anion levels were determined by the chemiluminescence of luminol derivative. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was estimated by measuring the cellular oxidation products of 2’, 7’-dichlorofluorescin diacetate.
          ResultsIn retinal microglial cells, treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced immediate NADPH oxidase-generated ROS. This was followed by p38 MAPK activation and resulted in a time-dependent increase in TNF-α production. At a later phase, LPS induced NO, ROS, and p38 MAPK activation that peaked at 2-6 h and was accompanied by morphological change of microglia. Treatment with 1 μM CBD inhibited ROS formation and p38 MAPK activation, NO and TNF-α formation, and maintained cell morphology. In addition, LPS-treated rat retinas showed an accumulation of macrophages and activated microglia, significant levels of ROS and nitrotyrosine, activation of p38 MAPK, and neuronal apoptosis. These effects were blocked by treatment with 5 mg/kg CBD.
          ConclusionsRetinal inflammation and degeneration in uveitis are caused by oxidative stress. CBD exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects by a mechanism that involves blocking oxidative stress and activation of p38 MAPK and microglia.""",0
"""BackgroundThe objective was to develop a novel algorithm that can predict, based on field survey data, the minimum vaccination coverage required to reduce the mean number of infections per infectious individual to less than one (the Outbreak Response Immunization Threshold or ORIT) from up to six days in the advance.
          Methodology/Principal FindingsFirst, the relationship between the rate of immunization and the ORIT was analyzed to establish a link. This relationship served as the basis for the development of a recursive algorithm that predicts the ORIT using survey data from two consecutive days. The algorithm was tested using data from two actual measles outbreaks. The prediction day difference (PDD) was defined as the number of days between the second day of data input and the day of the prediction. The effects of different PDDs on the prediction error were analyzed, and it was found that a PDD of 5 minimized the error in the prediction. In addition, I developed a model demonstrating the relationship between changes in the vaccination coverage and changes in the individual reproduction number.
          Conclusions/SignificanceThe predictive algorithm for the ORIT generates a viable prediction of the minimum number of vaccines required to stop an outbreak in real time. With this knowledge, the outbreak control agency may plan to expend the lowest amount of funds required stop an outbreak, allowing the diversion of the funds saved to other areas of medical need.""",0

"USP4 is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family of deubiquitinating enzymes that has a role in spliceosome regulation. Here, we show that the crystal structure of the minimal catalytic domain of USP4 has the conserved USP-like fold with its typical ubiquitin-binding site. A ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain inserted into the catalytic domain has autoregulatory function. This Ubl domain can bind to the catalytic domain and compete with the ubiquitin substrate, partially inhibiting USP4 activity against different substrates. Interestingly, other USPs, such as USP39, could relieve this inhibition.",0
"""BackgroundWe previously found a significant benefit of vitamin C supplementation in asthmatic children.
          PurposeTo test whether the effect of vitamin C on asthma is heterogeneous over the participant population.
          MethodsEgyptian asthmatic children between 7 and 10 years of age (n = 60) were included in the cross-over trial. They were administered 0.2 grams per day of vitamin C and placebo for separate 6-week periods. The variation in the vitamin C effect on two clinically relevant outcomes was analyzed: the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT), which measures the severity of asthma symptoms (the scale ranges from 0 to 27 points, < 20 points indicating unsatisfactory asthma control), and FEV1
          ResultsThe effect of vitamin C on the C-ACT was significantly modified by age and baseline C-ACT levels. In the children aged 7.0-8.2 years with a baseline C-ACT of 18 to 19 points, vitamin C increased the C-ACT score by 4.2 points (95% CI: 3.3-5.3); whereas in the children aged 8.3-10 years who had a baseline C-ACT of 14 to 15 points, vitamin C increased the C-ACT score by only 1.3 points (95% CI: 0.1-2.5).

"ObjectiveMany traumatised refugees suffer from both persistent pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To date, no specific guidelines exist for treatment of this group of patients. This paper presents data on a pilot treatment study conducted with 15 traumatised refugees with persistent pain and PTSD.
          MethodsParticipants received 10 sessions of pain-focused treatment with biofeedback (BF) followed by 10 sessions of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET). Structured interviews and standardised questionnaires were used to assess symptoms of pain intensity, pain disability, PTSD and quality of life directly before and after treatment and at 3 months follow-up.
          ResultsFollowing the combined intervention, participants showed a significant reduction in both pain and PTSD symptoms, as well as improved quality of life. Additionally, biofeedback increased motivation for subsequent trauma-focused therapy, which in turn was related to larger PTSD treatment gains.

"The incidence and severity of allergic asthma have increased over the last century, particularly in the United States and other developed countries. This time frame was characterized by marked environmental changes, including enhanced hygiene, decreased pathogen exposure, increased exposure to inhaled pollutants, and changes in diet. Although iron is well-known to participate in critical biologic processes such as oxygen transport, energy generation, and host defense, iron deficiency remains common in the United States and world-wide. The purpose of these studies was to determine how dietary iron supplementation affected the severity of allergic inflammation in the lungs, using a classic model of IgE-mediated allergy in mice. Results showed that mice fed an iron-supplemented diet had markedly decreased allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity, eosinophil infiltration, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, compared with control mice on an unsupplemented diet that generated mild iron deficiency but not anemia.

"BackgroundIn patients with schizophrenia, altered brain activation and motor activity levels are central features, reflecting cognitive impairments and negative symptoms, respectively. Newer studies using nonlinear methods have addressed the severe disturbances in neurocognitive functioning that is regarded as one of the core features of schizophrenia. Our aim was to compare brain activation and motor activity in a patient during pharmacological treatment that was switched from a first- to a second-generation antipsychotic drug. We hypothesised that this change of medication would increase level of responding in both measures.
          Case presentationWe present the case of a 53-year-old male with onset of severe mental illness in adolescence, ICD-10 diagnosed as schizophrenia of paranoid type, chronic form. We compared brain activation and motor activity in this patient during pharmacological treatment with a first-generation (perphenazin), and later switched to a second-generation (risperidone) antipsychotic drug. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activation and wrist worn actigraphy to measure motor activity.
          ConclusionOur study showed that brain activation decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning in this patient, when changing from a first to a second generation antipsychotic drug. However the mean motor activity level was unchanged, although risperidone reduced variability, particularly short-term variability from minute to minute. Compared to the results from previous studies, the present findings indicate that changing to a second-generation antipsychotic alters variability measures towards that seen in a control group, but with reduced brain activation, which was an unexpected finding.",0
"Lymphocyte apoptosis is one reason for immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, although the triggers are unknown. We hypothesized that molecules in plasma, which are up-regulated during sepsis, may be responsible for this. In this study, peripheral lymphocyte apoptosis caused by extracellular histones was confirmed both in mouse and human primary lymphocytes, in which histones induced lymphocyte apoptosis dose-dependently and time-dependently. To identify which intracellular signal pathways were activated, phosphorylation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were evaluated during this process, and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was used to confirm the role of p38 in lymphocyte apoptosis induced by histones. To investigate the mitochondrial injury during these processes, we analyzed Bcl2 degradation and Rhodamine 123 to assess mitochondrial-membrane stability, via cyclosporin A as an inhibitor for mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Then, caspase 3 activation was also checked by western-blotting. We found that p38 phosphorylation, mitochondrial injury and caspase 3 activation occurred dose-dependently in histones-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis. We also observed that p38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased lymphocyte apoptotic ratio by 49% (P<0.05), and inhibition of MPT protected lymphocytes from apoptosis. Furthermore, to investigate whether histones are responsible for lymphocyte apoptosis, various concentrations of histone H4 neutralization antibodies were co-cultured with human primary lymphocytes and plasma from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice or sham mice. The results showed that H4 neutralization antibody dose-dependently blocked lymphocyte apoptosis caused by septic plasma in vitro",0
"ObjectiveAccumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory cell infiltration is crucial pathogenesis during the initiation and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given Rho-kinase (ROCK), an important kinase control the actin cytoskeleton, regulates the inflammatory cell infiltration, thus, we investigate the possibility and mechanism of preventing experimental AAA progression via targeting ROCK in mice porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model.
          Methods and ResultsAAA was created in 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by transient intraluminal porcine pancreatic elastase infusion into the infrarenal aorta. The mRNA level of RhoA, RhoC, ROCK1 and ROCK2 were elevated in aneurismal aorta. Next, PPE infusion mice were orally administrated with vehicle or ROCK inhibitor (Fasudil at dose of 200 mg/kg/day) during the period of day 1 prior to PPE infusion to day 14 after PPE infusion. PPE infusion mice treated with Fasudil produced significantly smaller aneurysms as compare to PPE infusion mice treated with vehicle. AAAs developed in all vehicle-treated groups within 14 days, whereas AAAs developed in six mice (66%, 6/9) treated with Fasudil within 14 days. Furthermore, our semi-quantitative histological analysis revealed that blood vessels and macrophages were significantly reduced in Fasudil treated mice during the AAA progression. Finally, when mice with existing AAAs were treated with Fasudil, the enlargement was nearly completely suppressed.
          ConclusionFasudil inhibits experimental AAA progression and stabilize existing aneurysms, through mechanisms likely related to impaired mural macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis. These findings suggest that ROCK inhibitor may hold substantial translational value for AAA diseases.",0
"Author SummaryThe torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a diverse group of viruses that ubiquitously infect humans and establish persistent infections. Despite their prevalence, TTVs lack concrete disease associations and remain among the most poorly characterized human viruses. Here we use computational and synthetic approaches to identify new noncoding miRNA genes in the TTVs. We demonstrate that TTVs utilize the host miRNA biogenesis machinery to produce biologically active miRNAs. To gain a functional understanding of the new TTV genes, we focus on a particular viral isolate and identify N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) as a direct target. NMI is a known modulator of interferon and cytokine signaling. Similar to other viruses encoding miRNAs, the TTVs likely utilize miRNAs to promote persistence and immune evasion. Our study provides new insights into novel TTV gene products and the interactions of this virus with its host.",0

"A difficult problem in quantum network communications is how to efficiently transmit quantum information over large-scale networks with common channels. We propose a solution by developing a quantum encoding approach. Different quantum states are encoded into a coherent superposition state using quantum linear optics. The transmission congestion in the common channel may be avoided by transmitting the superposition state. For further decoding and continued transmission, special phase transformations are applied to incoming quantum states using phase shifters such that decoders can distinguish outgoing quantum states. These phase shifters may be precisely controlled using classical chaos synchronization via additional classical channels. Based on this design and the reduction of multiple-source network under the assumption of restricted maximum-flow, the optimal scheme is proposed for specially quantized multiple-source network. In comparison with previous schemes, our scheme can greatly increase the transmission efficiency.",0
"The human genome is pervasively transcribed, yet only a small fraction is coding. Here we address whether this noncoding transcription arises at promoters, and detail the interactions of initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Using ChIP-exo, we identify ~160,000 transcription initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer genomes. Only ~5% associate with mRNA genes. The remaining associate with non-polyadenylated noncoding transcription. Regardless, Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP/TFIIB remain at the promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core promoter elements: BREud",0
"PurposeStudies on the association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and breast cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We quantitatively assessed this association by conducting a meta-analysis based on the evidence from observational studies.
          MethodsWe searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published up to and including December 31, 2013. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for cancer risk.
          ResultsA total of 17 studies (9 cohort studies, 8 case-control studies) were selected for further study. These studies included 149,607 female subjects, of which 53,812 were CCBs users, who were followed for 2–16 years. The risks of breast cancer among patients receiving CCBs were significantly different for the pooled RRs (95% confidence interval) of cohort studies 1.08 (0.95, 1.20) and case-control studies 0.98 (0.86, 1.09). Differences were also noted for cancer risk, for CCBs use of <5 years 0.96 (0.78, 1.15), and for >5 years 1.01 (0.74, 1.28), as well as for ever used 1.08 (0.95, 1.20), and for current use 1.13 (0.83, 1.42). The RR for studies longer than 10 years was 1.71 (1.01, 2.42), and for studies evaluating nifedipine was 1.10 (0.87, 1.33) and diltiazem was 0.75 (0.40, 1.10).
          ConclusionsThe long-term use of CCBs appears to have a significant relationship with breast cancer. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to optimize the doses and types of these drugs needed to minimize their carcinogenic potential.",0
"PurposeThe axillary arch is an anomalous muscle that is not infrequently encountered during axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of breast cancer patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate how often the axillary arch is found during SLNB and whether it affects the intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate.
          MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the correlation between the presence of the axillary arch and the SLN sampling failure rate during SLNB in 1,069 patients who underwent axillary SLNB for invasive breast cancer.
          ResultsOf 1,069 patients who underwent SLNB, 79 patients (7.4%) had the axillary arch present. The SLNB failure rate was high when the patient's body mass index was ≥25 (ppppp
          ConclusionThe axillary arch was found to be a significant factor affecting intraoperative SLN failure rate. It is necessary to keep in mind that carefully checking the high axillar region during SLNB in breast cancer patients with the axillary arch is important for reducing SLN sampling failure.",0
"ObjectivesAlthough a large gauge needle can procure more tissue at endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), its advantage over smaller needles is unclear. This study compared flexible 19G and 25G needles for EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic masses.

          ObjectiveTo systematically review the evidence of effectiveness MBSR and MBCT in different patient categories.
          MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of systematic reviews of RCTs, using the standardized MBSR or MBCT programs. We used PRISMA guidelines to assess the quality of the included reviews and performed a random effects meta-analysis with main outcome measure Cohen’s d. All types of participants were considered.
          ResultsThe search produced 187 reviews: 23 were included, covering 115 unique RCTs and 8,683 unique individuals with various conditions. Compared to wait list control and compared to treatment as usual, MBSR and MBCT significantly improved depressive symptoms (d=0.37; 95%CI 0.28 to 0.45, based on 5 reviews, N=2814), anxiety (d=0.49; 95%CI 0.37 to 0.61, based on 4 reviews, N=2525), stress (d=0.51; 95%CI 0.36 to 0.67, based on 2 reviews, N=1570), quality of life (d=0.39; 95%CI 0.08 to 0.70, based on 2 reviews, N=511) and physical functioning (d=0.27; 95%CI 0.12 to 0.42, based on 3 reviews, N=1015).

"IntroductionA wide variety of atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone and clozapine) are widely used in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are commonly seen in dementia, but results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and safety of these agents are conflicting. We aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotic drugs on neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia patients.
          MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for reports published before August 2014 were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials of atypical antipsychotic drugs therapy in patients with psychotic symptoms of dementia. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted information.
          ResultsOverall, 23 relevant RCTs with 5,819 participants were identified. This meta-analysis demonstrated a significant efficacy of atypical antipsychotics on psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions compared to placebo. In the meta-analysis, the weighted mean differences (WMDs) in change scores for psychiatric symptoms were in favor of aripiprazole (−4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) – 7.04 to −1.77) and risperidone (−1.48, 95% CI −2.35 to −0.61) compared to placebo. In cognitive effects, WMDs in change scores for the Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C) were in favor of aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine which ranged from a −0.30 points mean difference (95% CI:-0.59 to −0.01) in the aripiprazole trials to −0.43 (95% CI:-0.62 to −0.25) in the risperidone group. Patients receiving atypical antipsychotics showed no difference in risk for injuries or falls (PP
          ConclusionAripiprazole and risperidone are able to improve psychiatric symptoms and slow decline in cognition function at average 12 weeks in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. However, high adverse events may offset the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in dementia.

"Summary
          BackgroundDespite the importance of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in China, no nationally representative studies have characterised the clinical profiles, management, and outcomes of this cardiac event during the past decade. We aimed to assess trends in characteristics, treatment, and outcomes for patients with STEMI in China between 2001 and 2011.
          MethodsIn a retrospective analysis of hospital records, we used a two-stage random sampling design to create a nationally representative sample of patients in China admitted to hospital for STEMI in 3 years (2001, 2006, and 2011). In the first stage, we used a simple random-sampling procedure stratified by economic–geographical region to generate a list of participating hospitals. In the second stage we obtained case data for rates of STEMI, treatments, and baseline characteristics from patients attending each sampled hospital with a systematic sampling approach. We weighted our findings to estimate nationally representative rates and assess changes from 2001 to 2011. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01624883.
          FindingsWe sampled 175 hospitals (162 participated in the study) and 18 631 acute myocardial infarction admissions, of which 13 815 were STEMI admissions. 12 264 patients were included in analysis of treatments, procedures, and tests, and 11 986 were included in analysis of in-hospital outcomes. Between 2001 and 2011, estimated national rates of hospital admission for STEMI per 100 000 people increased (from 3·5 in 2001, to 7·9 in 2006, to 15·4 in 2011; ptrendvstrendvstrendvstrendvstrendtrendtrend
          InterpretationDuring the past decade in China, hospital admissions for STEMI have risen; in these patients, comorbidities and the intensity of testing and treatment have increased. Quality of care has improved for some treatments, but important gaps persist and inhospital mortality has not decreased. National efforts are needed to improve the care and outcomes for patients with STEMI in China.",0

In sham mice, an abdominal incision was made, followed by dissection of the bilateral renal pedicle, with no further cross-clamping of arteries. Silymarin + I/R mice were administered 100 mg/kg silymarin daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery, whereas I/R mice were administered (i.g.) 0.9 % saline + 0.1 % (v/v) ethanol daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery. Silymarin + I/R and I/R mice were subjected to renal ischemia to induce acute kidney injury after 45-min clamping of bilateral renal arteries. Serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were measured. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining was undertaken to detect damaged renal tissue. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunofluorescent detection of CD68 expression was undertaken for each group. Levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted by renal tissue were monitored by ELISA. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Expression of cleaved-caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by western blotting.

"AbstractGastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility is a common complication in acute, critically ill, postoperative, and chronic patients that may lead to impaired nutrient delivery, poor clinical, and patient-reported outcomes. Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to treat GI dysmotility were investigated in dozens of clinical studies. However, they often yielded conflicting results, at least in part, because various (nonstandardized) definitions of GI dysmotility were used and methodological quality of studies was poor. While a universally accepted definition of GI dysmotility is yet to be developed, a systematic analysis of data derived from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials may provide robust data on absolute and relative effectiveness of various interventions as the study outcome (GI motility) was assessed in the least biased manner.To systematically review data from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials to determine and compare the effectiveness of interventions that affect GI motility.Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE) were searched. A random effects model was used for meta-analysis. The summary estimates were reported as mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).A total of 38 double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials involving 2371 patients were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review.

"IntroductionAdherence to treatment and dietary restrictions is important for health outcomes of patients with chronic/end-stage kidney disease and hypertension. The relationship of adherence with nutritional and health literacy in children, adolescents, and young adults is not well understood. The current study examined the relationship of health literacy, nutrition knowledge, nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance, and medication adherence in a sample of children and young people with chronic/end-stage kidney disease and hypertension.
          MethodsWe enrolled 74 patients (aged 7–29 y) with a diagnosis of chronic/end-stage kidney disease and hypertension from the University of North Carolina Kidney Center. Participants completed instruments of nutrition literacy (Disease-Specific Nutrition Knowledge Test), health literacy (Newest Vital Sign), nutrition behavior (Nutrition Knowledge–Behavior Concordance Scale), and medication adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale). Linear and binary logistic regressions were used to test the associations.
          ResultsIn univariate comparisons, nutrition knowledge was significantly higher in people with adequate health literacy. Medication adherence was related to nutrition knowledge and nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance. Multivariate regression models demonstrated that knowledge of disease-specific nutrition restrictions did not significantly predict nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance scores. In logistic regression, knowledge of nutrition restrictions did not significantly predict medication adherence. Lastly, health literacy and nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance were significant predictors of medication adherence.
          ConclusionNutrition knowledge and health literacy skills are positively associated. Nutrition knowledge, health literacy, and nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance are positively related to medication adherence. Future research should focus on additional factors that may predict disease-specific nutrition behavior (adherence to dietary restrictions) in children and young people with chronic conditions.",0

"Vaccination is the most powerful way to prevent human beings from contracting infectious diseases including viruses. In the case of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, an unexpectedly novel disease entity, HPV vaccination associated neuro-immunopathetic syndrome (HANS), has been reported and remains to be carefully verified. To elucidate the mechanism of HANS, we applied a strategy similar to the active experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model - one of the most popular animal models used to induce maximum immunological change in the central nervous system. Surprisingly, mice vaccinated with pertussis toxin showed neurological phenotypes that include low responsiveness of the tail reflex and locomotive mobility. Pathological analyses revealed the damage to the hypothalamus and circumventricular regions around the third ventricle, and these regions contained apoptotic vascular endothelial cells. These data suggested that HPV-vaccinated donners that are susceptible to the HPV vaccine might develop HANS under certain environmental factors. These results will give us the new insight into the murine pathological model of HANS and help us to find a way to treat of patients suffering from HANS.",0
"The archaeological sites near Monte Alegre, along Brazil's lower Amazon River, provide new information on the little-known activities and symbolism of South American Paleoindians toward the end of the Ice Age. While paleoindian sites like Monte Verde in Chile, or Guitarrero Cave in Peru, are located near the pacific coast, Monte Alegre lies much further inland, 680 km upriver from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Atlantic Coast. With excavated wood charcoal radiocarbon dated as early as 13,200 calibrated years ago, the hill—as a source of sandstone and quartz lithics—supplied early pioneers with adequate tools needed for colonizing the interior of the continent. Once there, they painted rock art on the landscape, which bears a record of the sun's horizon positions throughout the year. At just 2° south of the equator, Monte Alegre shows no overt seasonal changes beyond fluctuating rainfall amounts, unlike at higher latitudes where temperature, amount of daylight, foliage, and forms of precipitation markedly change. Near the equator, solar and stellar horizon sightings most visibly track the passage of time and seasonal cycles. However, horizons are often hidden behind high forest canopy throughout much of the Amazon Rainforest; but in the Monte Alegre hill ridges looming above the river, paleoindians could hike above the canopy to peer at the horizon, more effectively synchronizing their activities to ecological cycles. This research suggests that Monte Alegre paleoindians delimited the azimuthal range of the sun in a solar year with notational pictographs aligned to horizon sightings at Painel do Pilão, and leaving a painted grid of tally marks that might have served as a rudimentary early calendar. The broad-reaching implication for early Americans is that through the strategic placement of rock art, these ancient artists fostered predictive archaeorecording from which resources could be optimally extracted, ceremonial activities could be consistently scheduled, and gatherings for social and economic exchange could be more efficiently coordinated.",0
"BackgroundTREM-1 acts as an amplifier of inflammation expressed on macrophages. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TREM-1 and macrophage polarization, and association of TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization with insulin resistance (IR) in obese population compared to non-obese population.
          MethodsWe enrolled 38 patients after obtaining IRB approval for this study. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of general macrophage marker (CD68), M1 marker (CD86, CCR7, iNOS, IFNγ, TNF-α and IL-6,), M2 marker (CD206, CD163, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokine axis (MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5) along with TREM-1 and TREM-2 in omentum fat, subcutaneous fat, and liver biopsy tissues of non-obese (N = 5), obese non-diabetics, (N = 16) and obese diabetics (N = 17).
          ResultsThe results of our study showed over-expression of TREM-1, M1 markers and down-regulation of TREM-2 and M2 markers in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsies of obese patients (diabetics and non-diabetics) compared to non-obese patients. Overall, the obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers (TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and down-regulation of M2 markers (CD206, CD163 and IL-4) in liver biopsy compared to obese non-diabetics.
          ConclusionsTREM-1 expression is significantly increased along with the M1 markers in liver biopsy of obese diabetic (17/17) and obese non-diabetic patients (9/16). Our data suggests that TREM-1 overexpression and M1 macrophage polarization are associated with obesity-induced IR.",0

          ResultsSerum levels of miR-143, -145 and -223 were elevated in patients with CKD compared with healthy controls. They were further increased in chronic haemodialysis patients, but were below control levels in renal transplant recipients. In contrast, circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-155 levels, which were also elevated in CKD patients, were lower in the haemodialysis group and even lower in the transplant group. Four of the five miRNA species were correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, and three were correlated with circulating uraemic toxins.

"BackgroundPregnancy is a period of transition, which makes women more vulnerable and in unfavorable conditions may lead to psychopathology in both mother and infant. It is essential to outline factors adversely affecting the resolution of this period. Early interventions and why they matter: Interventions during pregnancy can provide important improvement in the outcome for both maternal and infant mental health.
          AimThe aim of the study is to evaluate the risk factors of antenatal anxiety and depression focusing particularly on maternal representations of the relationship towards the fetus and her own parents during pregnancy and the early postpartum period.
          MethodsThe study is outlined using a quantifiable interview during pregnancy to evaluate the woman’s ability to keep her child in mind, measured by reflective functioning. Reflective functioning provides information regarding the pregnant woman’s relationship quality to her fetus and important people in her life. Primiparae in Stockholm around gestation week 20 are asked about their experience with respect to pregnancy, their relationship to their family, partner, and their unborn child. The women selected to the study are an at risk population, with high levels of stress, childhood adversity, and/or history of mental health. These women are more vulnerable to develop perinatal anxiety and depression.
          ResultsThe pregnancy interview provides valuable insight into the pregnant women’s psychic constitution. The quantifiable measure of their mental state, reflective functioning, serves as measure of quality of the mother’s parenting capacity. The countertransference and transference of the interviewer towards the women during the interview enables a more profound understanding of the underlying dynamics and constructs of repression, aggression, mourning, and narcissistic defenses.
          ConclusionA better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the pregnant women’s intrapsychic reorganization of motherhood and her relation to the unborn child shall facilitate specific early interventions. These interventions shall be targeted to specific risk groups and enable the prevention of adverse child outcomes.",0

          ResultsAccording to our study, the expression levels of claudin-2 and claudin-5 were reduced, while the expression of claudin-8 was increased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues in comparison with non-neoplastic mucosal tissues. Correlations between claudin-2 and -5 expression and metastatic progression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were also found.
          ConclusionIn summary, our research reveals distinct expression profiles of claudin-2, − 5 and − 8 in non-neoplastic mucosal tissues and nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. In addition, the expression of these claudin proteins was highly correlated with metastatic progression and prognosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and had predictive value for the metastasis and survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",0
"NaCT is a Na+-coupled transporter for citrate expressed in hepatocytes and neurons. It is the mammalian ortholog of INDY (I’m Not Dead Yet), a transporter which modifies lifespan in Drosophila. Here we describe a hitherto unknown transport system for citrate in mammalian cells. When liver and mammary epithelial cells were pretreated with the iron supplement ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), uptake of citrate increased >10-fold. Iron chelators abrogated the stimulation of citrate uptake in FAC-treated cells. The iron exporter ferroportin had no role in this process. The stimulation of citrate uptake also occurred when Fe3+ was added during uptake without pretreatment. Similarly, uptake of Fe3+ was enhanced by citrate. The Fe3+-citrate uptake was coupled to Na+. This transport system was detectable in primary hepatocytes and neuronal cell lines. The functional features of this citrate transport system distinguish it from NaCT. Loss-of-function mutations in NaCT cause early-onset epilepsy and encephalopathy; the newly discovered Na+-coupled Fe3+-citrate transport system might offer a novel treatment strategy for these patients to deliver citrate into affected neurons independent of NaCT. It also has implications to iron-overload conditions where circulating free iron increases, which would stimulate cellular uptake of citrate and consequently affect multiple metabolic pathways.",0
"Summary
          BackgroundDiabetes and high body-mass index (BMI) are associated with increased risk of several cancers, and are increasing in prevalence in most countries. We estimated the cancer incidence attributable to diabetes and high BMI as individual risk factors and in combination, by country and sex.
          MethodsWe estimated population attributable fractions for 12 cancers by age and sex for 175 countries in 2012. We defined high BMI as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2
          FindingsWe estimated that 5·6% of all incident cancers in 2012 were attributable to the combined effects of diabetes and high BMI as independent risk factors, corresponding to 792 600 new cases. 187 600 (24·5%) of 766 000 cases of liver cancer and 121 700 (38·4%) of 317 000 cases of endometrial cancer were attributable to these risk factors. In the conservative scenario, about 4·5% (626 900 new cases) of all incident cancers assessed were attributable to diabetes and high BMI combined. Individually, high BMI (544 300 cases) was responsible for twice as many cancer cases as diabetes (280 100 cases). 26·1% of diabetes-related cancers (equating to 77 000 new cases) and 31·9% of high BMI-related cancers (174 040 new cases) were attributable to increases in the prevalence of these risk factors from 1980 to 2002.
          InterpretationA substantial number of cancer cases are attributable to diabetes and high BMI. As the prevalence of these cancer risk factors increases, clinical and public health efforts should focus on identifying optimal preventive and screening measures for whole populations and individual patients.

"BackgroundDecompressive laminectomy (DI) is a standard operation for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patient with severe claudication symptoms for many years. However, patients whose symptom severity does not meet undergoing invasive surgery make therapeutic options into dilemma. Interspinous spacers (ISP) bridge the gap between surgical interventions and CC in management of LSS. In our study, we aim to systematically assess the two FDA-approved interspinous spacers for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: Superion versus X-STOP.
          MethodsElectronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library were searched to retrieve clinical trials concerning the comparison between Superion and X-STOP in treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis before April 2017. The following outcome measures were extracted: (1) Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) patient satisfaction score, (2) axial pain severity, (3) extremity pain severity, (4) back-specific functional impairment, (5) reoperation, and (6) complication. The data analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3.
          ResultsFive randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1118 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analysis indicated that the Superion group is superior to X-STOP in axial pain severity (SMD: 0.03; 95% CI 0.15, 0.45; pI2ppI2ppI2ppI2ppI2ppI2p
          ConclusionBoth the Superion and X-STOP interspinous spacers can relieve symptoms of LSS. In addition, the Superion spacer may represent a promising spacer for patient with LSS. As we know, the effectiveness and safety of ISP is still considered investigational and unfavor clinical results in the medical literature may continue to limit the appeal of IPS to many surgeons in the future. However, because of the advantage of IPS technique, it will win a wide place in the future degenerative lumbar microsurgery.",0
"BackgroundDaysy is a fertility monitor that uses the fertility awareness method by tracking and analyzing the individual menstrual cycle. In addition, Daysy can be connected to the application DaysyView to transfer stored personal data from Daysy to a smartphone or tablet (IOS, Android). This combination is interesting because as it is shown in various studies, the use of apps is increasing patients´ focus on their disease or their health behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate if by the additional use of an App and thereby improved usability of the medical device, it is possible to enhance the typical-use related as well as the method-related pregnancy rates.
          ResultIn the resultant group of 125 women (2076 cycles in total), 2 women indicated that they had been unintentionally pregnant during the use of the device, giving a typical-use related Pearl-Index of 1.3. Counting only the pregnancies which occurred as a result of unprotected intercourse during the infertile (green) phase, we found 1 pregnancy, giving a method-related Pearl-Index of 0.6. Calculating the pregnancy rate resulting from continuous use and unprotected intercourse exclusively on green days, gives a perfect-use Pearl-Index of 0.8.
          ConclusionIt seems that combining a specific biosensor-embedded device (Daysy), which gives the method a very high repeatable accuracy, and a mobile application (DaysyView) which leads to higher user engagement, results in higher overall usability of the method.

"Abstract
          Background:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-articular methylprednisolone for reducing pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
          Methods:We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.11), PubMed (1966-2017.11), Embase (1980-2017.11), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.11), and the Cochrane Library (1900-2017.11) for randomized clinical trials comparing the use of methylprednisolone to treat knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores and WOMAC function scores. Each outcome was combined and calculated using the statistical software STATA 12.0. Fixed/random effect model was adopted based on the heterogeneity tested by I2
          Results:A total of 739 patients were analyzed across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the WOMAC pain scores at 4 weeks (WMD = −1.384, 95% CI: −1.975 to −0.793, P = P = P = P = P = P = 
          Conclusion:Intra-articular methylprednisolone injection was associated with an improved pain relief and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, no severe adverse effects were observed. Due to the limited quality of the evidence currently available, higher quality RCTs were required.",0
"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully implemented in cattle research and breeding. However, moving from the associations to identifying the causal variants and revealing underlying mechanisms have proven complicated. In dairy cattle populations, we face a challenge due to long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) arising from close familial relationships in the studied individuals. Long range LD makes it difficult to distinguish if one or multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) are segregating in a genomic region showing association with a phenotype. We had two objectives in this study: 1) to distinguish between multiple QTL segregating in a genomic region, and 2) use of external information to prioritize candidate genes for a QTL along with the candidate variant.
          ResultsWe observed fixing the lead SNP as a covariate can help to distinguish additional close association signal(s). Thereafter, using the mammalian phenotype database, we successfully found candidate genes, in concordance with previous studies, demonstrating the power of this strategy. Secondly, we used variant annotation information to search for causative variants in our candidate genes. The variant information successfully identified known causal mutations and showed the potential to pinpoint the causative mutation(s) which are located in coding regions.
          ConclusionsOur approach can distinguish multiple QTL segregating on the same chromosome in a single analysis without manual input. Moreover, utilizing information from the mammalian phenotype database and variant effect predictor as post-GWAS analysis could benefit in candidate genes and causative mutations finding in cattle. Our study not only identified additional candidate genes for milk traits, but also can serve as a routine method for GWAS in dairy cattle.

"Media exposure influences mental health symptomology in response to salient aversive events, like terrorist attacks, but little has been done to explore the impact of news coverage that varies more subtly in affective content. Here, we utilized an existing data set in which participants self-reported physical symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and completed a potentiated startle task assessing their physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli at three time points (waves) over a 9-month period. Using a computational linguistics approach, we then calculated an average ratio of words with positive vs. negative affective connotations for only articles from news sources to which each participant self-reported being exposed over the prior 2 weeks at each wave of data collection. As hypothesized, individuals exposed to news coverage with more negative affective tone over the prior 2 weeks reported significantly greater physical and depressive symptoms, and had significantly greater physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli.",0
"BackgroundDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is caused by blood clotting in the deep veins. Thrombosis resolution and recanalization can be accelerated by endothelial progenitor cells. In this report, we investigated the effects of miR-126-loaded EPC-derived exosomes (miR-126-Exo) on EPCs function and venous thrombus resolution.
          MethodsIn vitro promotional effect of miR-126-Exo on the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs was investigated via transwell assay and tube formation assay. In addition, a mouse venous thrombosis model was constructed and treated with miR-126-Exo to clarify the therapeutic effect of miR-126-Exo by histological analysis. Lastly, this study predicted a target gene of miR-126 using target prediction algorithms and confirmed it by luciferase activity assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot.
          ResultsTranswell assay and tube formation assay indicated that miR-126-Exo could enhance the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs. Moreover, in vivo study manifested enhanced thrombus organization and recanalization after miR-126-Exo treatment. Meanwhile, we identified that Protocadherin 7 as a target gene of miR-126.
          ConclusionsTo sum up, our results demonstrated that EPC-derived exosomes loaded with miR-126 significantly promoted thrombus resolution in an animal model of venous thrombosis, indicating exosomes as a promising potential vehicle carrying therapeutic molecules for DVT therapy.",0
"BackgroundHuman schistosomiases are acute and chronic infectious diseases of poverty. Currently, epidemiological data of urinary schistosomiasis (US) in school-age children (SAC) and adults are often reported together making it difficult to ascertain the true status of the disease. Based on this premise, we set out to carry out this review.
          MethodTo achieve this aim, we carried out a computer-aided search of PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, African Journals OnLine (AJOL) and the database of World Health Organization. However, the information obtained from these sources was supplemented with additional literatures from Mendeley, Research Gate, and Google.
          ResultsThe search yielded 183 literatures of which 93 full text research, review and online articles were deemed fit for inclusion. Our key findings showed that: (1) of all World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, Africa is the most endemic zone for US, with Kenya and Senegal recording the highest prevalence and mean intensity respectively; (2) SAC within the range of 5–16 years contribute most significantly to the transmission cycle of US globally; (3) gender is a factor to watch out for, with male often recording the highest prevalence and intensity of infection; (4) contact with open, potentially infested water sources contribute significantly to transmission; (5) parental factors (occupation and education status) predispose SAC to US; (6) economic vis a vis
          ConclusionIn view of the WHO strategic plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2020 and the findings from this review, it is obvious that this goal, in the face of realities, might not be achieved. It is imperative that annual control programmes be scaled up marginally, particularly in the African region of WHO. While US-based researches should be sponsored at the grass-root level to unveil hidden endemic foci, adequate facilities for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) should be put in place in all schools globally.",0
"We report a facile design of an ultra-thin broadband metamaterial absorber (MA) for C-band applications by utilizing a single layer of a metal-dielectric-metal structure of FR-4 substrate. The absorption performances are characterized using a numerical method. The proposed MA exhibits the broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with absorptivity above 90% and the high absorptivity is remained over 80% for a large incident angle up to 40° under both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations over the band. The origin of absorption mechanism is explained by the electric and surface current distributions, which is also supported by the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for C-band applications.",0

          Background:Prenatal exposure to depression has been considered as a risk factor for adverse childhood, while it is accompanied by unknown molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated biological processes between cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers who exposed to major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy mothers.
          Methods:The microarray data GSE114852 were downloaded to analyze the mRNA expression profiles of umbilical cord blood with 31 samples exposed to prenatal MDD and 62 samples with healthy mothers. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene ontology enrichment analyses were conducted to identify associated biochemical pathways and functional categories of the DEGs. The protein–protein interaction network was constructed and the top 10 hub genes in the network were predicted.

"ImportanceAccelerometers and pedometers are accessible technologies that could have a role in encouraging physical activity (PA) in line with current recommendations. However, there is no solid evidence of their association with PA in participants with 1 or more cardiometabolic conditions such as diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
          ObjectivesTo assess the association of accelerometer- and pedometer-based interventions with increased activity and other improved health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic conditions and to examine characteristics of the studies that could influence the association of both interventions in improving PA.
          Data SourcesRecords from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and PsycINFO were searched from inception until August 2018 with no language restriction.
          Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials or cluster randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of wearable technology devices such as pedometers and accelerometers as motivating and monitoring tools for increasing PA were included. After removing duplicates, the searches retrieved 5762 references. Following abstract and title screening of 1439 references and full-text screening of 107 studies, 36 studies met inclusion criteria.
          Data Extraction and SynthesisMean difference in PA was assessed by random-effects meta-analysis. Where the scale was different across studies, the standardized mean difference was used instead. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2
          Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was objectively measured PA in the short to medium term (postintervention to 8 months’ follow-up).
          ResultsThirty-six randomized clinical trials (20 using accelerometers and 16 using pedometers) involving 5208 participants were eligible for review. Meta-analysis involving 32 of these trials (4856 participants) showed medium improvements in PA: accelerometers and pedometers combined vs comparator showed a small significant increase in PA overall (standardized mean difference, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.28-0.51]; I2PP
          Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, complex accelerometer- and pedometer-based interventions led to significant small to medium improvements in PA levels of people with cardiometabolic conditions. However, longer-term trials are needed to assess their performance over time. This study found no evidence that simple self-monitored interventions using either pedometers or accelerometers are associated with improvements in PA.",0

"Objective Propofol is a classical anesthetic and induces consciousness loss, and gamma-aminobutyric-acid-type-A (GABA-A) receptor is its target. Righting reflex is associated with conscious response. The nucleus basalis (NB) acts as a major relay between the reticular activating system and the frontal cortex (FC). Propofol may mediate righting reflex by affecting GABA-A receptor in NB. 
          Methods Fifty male SD rats (250-350 g) were divided into parts I and II. In part I, 20 male SD rats were randomly divided into control group (CG) and NB-lesion group (NG, ibotenic acid-induced NB lesion). In part II, 30 male SD rats were treated with saline (0.9% NaCl, SG group), muscimol (a GABA-A receptor agonist, MG group), and gabazine (a GABA-A receptor antagonist, GG group) in NB, respectively. Two weeks later, the activity of the rats was measured between CG and NG groups. The rats were intravenously injected with propofol (50 mg/kg/h) to test the time of loss of righting reflex (LORR) in all rats. When LORR occurred, the rats received single administration of propofol (12 mg/kg) to measure the time of return of righting reflex (RORR). Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of the frontal cortex (FC) was recorded.

"BackgroundElectronic devices which mimic the functionality of biological synapses are a large step to replicate the human brain for neuromorphic computing and for numerous medical research investigations. One of the representative synaptic behaviors is paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). It has been widely investigated because it is regarded to be related to biological memory. However, plasticity behavior is only part of the human brain memory behavior.
          MethodsHere, we present a phenomenon which is opposite to PPF, i.e., paired-pulse inhibition (PPI), in nano oxide devices for the first time. The research here suggests that rather than being enhanced, the phenomena of memory loss would also be possessed by such electronic devices. The device physics mechanism behind memory loss behavior was investigated. This mechanism is sustained by historical memory and degradation manufactured by device trauma to regulate characteristically stimulated origins of artificial transmission behaviors.
          ResultsUnder the trauma of a memory device, both the signal amplitude and signal time stimulated by a pulse are lower than the first signal stimulated by a previous pulse in the PPF, representing a new scenario in the struggle for memory. In this way, more typical human brain behaviors could be simulated, including the effect of age on latency and error generation, cerebellar infarct, trauma and memory loss pharmacological actions (such as those caused by hyoscines and nitrazepam).
          ConclusionThus, this study developed a new approach for implementing the manner in which the brain works in semiconductor devices for improving medical research.",0

"BackgroundApoptosis and oxidative stress are the main etiology of age related cataract (ARC). This article aims to investigate the role of WRN in lens epithelial cells (LECs).
          MethodsWe estimated the methylation level of WRN in anterior lens capsule tissues of ARC patients. SRA01/04 (LECs) cells were treated with H22
          ResultsWRN was down-regulated and the methylation level of WRN was increased in the anterior lens capsule tissues. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR enhanced proliferation and repressed apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells. 5-Aza-CdR enhanced WRN expression. WRN knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells, which was rescued by 5-Aza-CdR. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR repressed ATM/p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, chloroquine inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells by activating ATM/p53 signaling pathway. The influence conferred by chloroquine was abolished by WRN overexpression.
          ConclusionOur study reveals that DNA methylation mediated WRN inhibits apoptosis and oxidative stress of human LECs through ATM/p53 signaling pathway.",0
"There is evidence that human decision-making is affected by current body energy levels and physiological states. There is less clear evidence linking decision-making to long-term changes in energy, as those associated with obesity. We explore the link between energy, obesity and dishonesty by comparing the behaviour of obese and lean subjects when hungry or sated while playing an anonymous die-under-cup task. Participants performed the task either before or after breakfast. We find that short-term switches in energy have only a mild effect on dishonesty, as only lean females lie less when sated. By contrast, obese subjects lie more than lean subjects in both conditions, and they lie more to avoid the lowest payoff than to get the highest payoff. Our findings suggest that the observed patterns are more likely mediated by factors associated with obesity than by short term energy dynamics, and call for a better integration of the psychological, economic and biological drivers of moral behaviour.",0

          ConclusionsCorneal endothelial diseases are associated with TCF4 reduction; TCF4 may be a potential target for hCEC diseases. Gene therapy using TCF4 Human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) have limited regenerative capacity in vivo. Reduced hCEC density results in bullous keratopathy requiring corneal transplantation. This study reveals the role of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in hCEC diseases and suggests that TCF4 may be a molecular target for hCEC regeneration.",0
"Abstract
          BackgroundIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status has emerged as an important prognostic marker in gliomas. Currently, reliable IDH mutation determination requires invasive surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop a highly accurate, MRI-based, voxelwise deep-learning IDH classification network using T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and compare its performance to a multicontrast network.
          MethodsMultiparametric brain MRI data and corresponding genomic information were obtained for 214 subjects (94 IDH-mutated, 120 IDH wild-type) from The Cancer Imaging Archive and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Two separate networks were developed, including a T2w image-only network (T2-net) and a multicontrast (T2w, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and T1 postcontrast) network (TS-net) to perform IDH classification and simultaneous single label tumor segmentation. The networks were trained using 3D Dense-UNets. Three-fold cross-validation was performed to generalize the networks’ performance. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was also performed. Dice scores were computed to determine tumor segmentation accuracy.
          ResultsT2-net demonstrated a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.14% ± 0.04 in predicting IDH mutation status, with a sensitivity of 0.97 ± 0.03, specificity of 0.98 ± 0.01, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 ± 0.01. TS-net achieved a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.12% ± 0.09, with a sensitivity of 0.98 ± 0.02, specificity of 0.97 ± 0.001, and an AUC of 0.99 ± 0.01. The mean whole tumor segmentation Dice scores were 0.85 ± 0.009 for T2-net and 0.89 ± 0.006 for TS-net.
          ConclusionWe demonstrate high IDH classification accuracy using only T2-weighted MR images. This represents an important milestone toward clinical translation.",0

"PurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)–positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone. Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade. The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.
          MethodsPatients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI. Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI. Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety.
          ResultsThree hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 vPP

"BackgroundNeuroinflammation causes neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Ipriflavone (IP), therapeutic compound to postmenopausal osteoporosis, has limited estrogenic activity and is accounted as AChE inhibitor. The developing of drug delivery systems to enable drug targeting to specific sites increases the drug therapeutic effect.
          ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to formulate and evaluate ipriflavone loaded albumin nanoparticles (IP-Np) along with free ipriflavone against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation in rats.
          MethodsNeuroinflammation was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p) injection of LPS (250 μg/kg rat body weight) then treatments were conducted with (1)(2)(3)
          ResultsA significant upsurge in inflammatory mediators and decline in antioxidant status were observed in LPS-induced rats. In one hand, ipriflavone (50 mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80 ameliorated LPS induced brain hippocampal inflammation where they depreciated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and enhanced antioxidant status. In another hand, ipriflavone at dose (5 mg/kg) didn’t show the same therapeutic effect.
          ConclusionThe current study provides evidence for the potential neuroprotective effect of ipriflavone (50 mg/kg) against LPS-induced neuroinflammation in rats through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Moreover, nanoparticles significantly attenuated neuroinflammation in concentration lower than the effective therapeutic dose of free drug ten times.",0
"BackgroundDysregulation of lncRNAs is frequent in glioma and has emerged as an important mechanism involved in tumorigenesis. Previous analysis of Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database indicated that LBX2-AS1 expression is one of differentially expression lncRNA between lower grade glioma (LGG) (grade II and III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the function and mechanism of LBX2-AS1 in glioma has not been evaluated yet.
          MethodsHere, we analyzed the expression of LBX2-AS1 in GTEx data (normal brain), TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM. RT-PCR was performed to detect LBX2-AS1 in surgery obtained normal brain and glioma. CCK-8 kit and Annexin V-FITC-PI Apoptosis Detection Kit were used to study the function of LBX2-AS1 on glioma proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, western blotting and dual luciferase reporter assay were carried out to investigate the target miRNA of LBX2-AS1. The discovered mechanism was validated by the rescue assay.
          ResultsFollowing study of GTEx and TCGA data, LBX2-AS1 was significantly elevated in glioma compared with normal brain and in GBM compared with LGG. Higher expression of LBX2-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with glioma. Expression of LBX2-AS1 was positively correlated with pathology classification of glioma. Knockdown of LBX2-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in glioma. LBX2-AS1 have complimentary binding site for tumor suppressor miR-491-5p and we showed that LBX2-AS1 sponged miR-491-5p to upregulate TRIM28 expression in glioma cells. TRIM28 overexpression attenuated the effect of LBX2-AS1 knockdown on glioma cells.
          ConclusionsIn conclusion, LBX2-AS1 was an increased lncRNA in glioma. Mechanistically, LBX2-AS1 promoted glioma cell proliferation and resistance to cell apoptosis via sponging miR-491-5p.",0
"BackgroundMagnesium sulphate given to women immediately prior to very preterm birth protects the perinatal brain, so fewer babies die or develop cerebral palsy. How magnesium sulphate exerts these beneficial effects remains uncertain. The aim of the MagNUM Study was to assess the effect of exposure to antenatal magnesium sulphate on MRI measures of brain white matter microstructure at term equivalent age.
          MethodsNested cohort study within the randomised Magnesium sulphate at 30 to <34 weeks’ Gestational age Neuroprotection Trial (MAGENTA). Mothers at risk of preterm birth at 30 to <34 weeks’ gestation were randomised to receive either 4 g of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate [8 mmol magnesium ions], or saline placebo, infused over 30 min when preterm birth was planned or expected within 24 h. Participating babies underwent diffusion tensor MRI at term equivalent age. The main outcomes were fractional anisotropy across the white matter tract skeleton compared using Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), with adjustment for postmenstrual age at birth and at MRI, and MRI site. Researchers and families were blind to treatment group allocation during data collection and analyses.
          FindingsOf the 109 participating babies the demographics of the 60 babies exposed to magnesium sulphate were similar to the 49 babies exposed to placebo. In babies whose mothers were allocated to magnesium sulphate, fractional anisotropy was higher within the corticospinal tracts and corona radiata, the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi compared to babies whose mothers were allocated placebo (P
          InterpretationIn babies born preterm, antenatal magnesium sulphate exposure promotes development of white matter microstructure in pathways affecting both motor and cognitive function. This may be one mechanism for the neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulphate treatment prior to preterm birth.

"ObjectivesPreterm birth (PTB) occurs in 5% to 18% of newborns. However, the underlying inflammatory mechanisms have not been elucidated.
          MethodsWe established a mouse model of infection-associated PTB. Physical signs in pregnant mice with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment were observed, and the frequencies of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2- and TLR4-positive CD11b+ cells were analyzed. Cytokine levels in plasma and pathological changes were assessed following LPS treatment. A rescue experiment was used to probe potential immunologic mechanisms underlying PTB.
          ResultsLymphocyte infiltration could be observed in the placentas of mice following intrauterine injection with LPS. The percentage of inflammatory cells decreased 12 hours after treatment. Moreover, TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood cells was significantly increased 4 hours after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Peak TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood cells occurred 8 hours post-treatment. TLR4 and TLR-2/4 inhibitors reduced levels of interleukin-10, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α in peripheral blood and delayed PTB.

"BackgroundNight-shift workers experience circadian rhythm disruption, changes in sleep time duration, and effects on their eating habits. All these factors may be related to the release of inflammatory mediators and may affect oral inflammation and periodontal health status. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of sleep time duration on oral inflammation and periodontal health status in night-shift workers and non-night-shift workers.
          MethodsThis study involved two groups with 27 participants each: one group of night-shift workers and one group of non-night-shift workers. Examination of depth of pocket and bleeding on probing (BOP) was conducted with a periodontal probe. Non-stimulating saliva samples were collected to analyze the levels of melatonin, malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) using ELISA. Comparisons for each parameter were performed using independent t
          ResultsThe night-shift worker group had a short sleep time duration (p = 0.000). The salivary melatonin level of the night-shift workers was lower than that of the non-night-shift workers (p = 0.000). MDA, depth of pocket, and BOP were higher in the night-shift workers (p = 0.000). Only salivary melatonin showed a correlation with sleep time duration in the night-shift worker group (p < 0.05). Neither subject group showed an effect of sleep time duration on depth of pocket, BOP, salivary melatonin, MDA, or TNF-α (p > 0.05).
          ConclusionNight-shift workers showed higher rates of oral inflammation and periodontal health status, but there was no relationship between these factors and sleep time duration.",0

"ObjectiveResearchers have revealed the combined functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNA (miRNAs) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to understand the role of nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and miR-381 involving insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in PCOS.
          MethodsPCOS rat model was established by dehydroepiandrosterone induction. NEAT1, miR-381 and IGF1 expression in ovarian granulosa cells of PCOS patients and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were tested. Bioinformatics website and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were utilized to verify the relationship between NEAT1 and miR-381 and that between miR-381 and IGF1. Levels of sex hormone, pathological changes and ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were detected. Ovarian granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed in vitro.
          ResultsNEAT1 and IGF1 expression increased while miR-381 expression decreased in the ovarian granulosa cells of patients with PCOS and the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vivo experiments, interference with NEAT1 improved the levels of sex hormones, alleviated pathological changes and suppressed ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vitro cell experiments, interference with NEAT1 suppressed apoptosis and enhanced cell proliferation of ovarian granulosa cells. NEAT1 interference-mediated effect would be reversed by up-regulating miR-381. NEAT1 acted as a ceRNA to adsorb miR-381 to target IGF1. Overexpression of IGF1 reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-381 on ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis.
          ConclusionInterference with NEAT1 increases miR-381 and reduces IGF1 levels, effectively improving the levels of sex hormones and reducing the pathological damage of ovarian tissue in rats with PCOS.

"Antiandrogens have demonstrated a protective effect for COVOD-19 patients in observational and interventional studies. The goal of this study was to determine if proxalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, could be an effective treatment for men with COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at two outpatient centers (Brasilia, Brazil). Patients were recruited from October 21 to December 24, 2020 (clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT04446429). Male patients with confirmed COVID-19 but not requiring hospitalization (COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale <3) were administered proxalutamide 200 mg/day or placebo for up to 7 days. The primary endpoint was hospitalization rate at 30 days post-randomization. A total of 268 men were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. 134 patients receiving proxalutamide and 134 receiving placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.2% in men taking proxalutamide compared to 26% in placebo, P < 0.001. The 30-day hospitalization risk ratio was 0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03–0.27.

"Background and objectiveThe effectiveness of deferred surgical repair of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) post-myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiogenic shock remains limited to case reports. Our study aimed to investigate the outcomes and survival analysis following mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients after VSR who develop cardiogenic shock.
          MethodsWe analyzed 27 patients with post-MI VSR and cardiogenic shock who received deferred surgical repair while stabilized on MCS between January 2018 and March 2020. After normality test adjustments, continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). These were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. To identify predictors of operative mortality, univariate analysis of clinical characteristics and interventions followed by logistic regression was carried out. P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
          ResultsAll patients had preoperative MCS. Emergency repair was avoided in all the patients. The mean age of the participants was 64.96 with the majority being males (74.1%). On average, the mean time from MI to VSR repair was 18.85 days. Delayed revascularization was associated with increased mortality (OR 17.500, 95% CI 2.365–129.506, P = 0.005). Other factors associated with increased mortality were ejection fraction (EF), three-vessel disease, Killip class, early surgery, and prolonged use of inotropes. The operative mortality was 11% with an overall mortality of 33.3%. The one-year survival rate was 66.7%.

"This study explored the effects involved in silencing CLIC4 on apoptosis and proliferation of mouse liver cancer Hca-F and Hca-P cells. A
CLIC4-target small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed to compound into two individual complementary oligonucleotide chains. A process
of annealing and connection to a pSilencer vector was followed by transfection with Hca-F and Hca-P cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction and Western blotting techniques were used to determine CLIC4 mRNA and protein expressions. CCK8 assay and flow cytometry
were employed for analysis of the survival and apoptosis rate as well as the cell cycle in an octreotide-induced apoptosis model. Expressions of
caspase 3, caspase 9, and cleaved PARP were measured using Western blotting. The CLIC4 mRNA and protein expressions in Hca-F and Hca-P
cells transfected by pSilencer-CLIC4 siRNA plasmid in the blank group displayed remarkably decreased levels of expression, when compared
with both the control and negative control (NC) groups. Decreased survival rates and cleaved PARP expression, increased cell apoptosis rate,
expressions of caspase 3 and caspase 9 in Hca-F and Hca-P cells were detected in groups that had been cultured in a medium containing

"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is considered to be one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders affecting women of reproductive age. CiRS-126, an innovative circular microRNA, has previously been proven to be a promising miR-21 sponge. However, a
proper understanding of the impact of ciRS-126 on PCOS is needed. Circular RNA (CiRS) profiles were initially evaluated in ovarian
cortex samples obtained from 18 women with PCOS as well from 9 women without PCOS. Insulin-induced ovarian granulosa cells
isolated from mice were utilized for the functional study. CiRS microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR indicated that ciRs126 expression was downregulated while miR-21 expression was upregulated in PCOS samples and insulin-induced granulosa cells as
compared with non-PCOS samples and non-insulin-induced granulosa cells. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of ciRS-126 was
associated with a reduction in proliferation and increased apoptosis in insulin-treated granulosa cells. Meanwhile, bioinformatic
prediction and the results of the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated the presence of consecutive binding in the ciRS-126-miR21-programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) axis. Moreover, overexpression of miR-21 blocked ciRS-126 repression of proliferation
and triggered the death of insulin-induced granulosa cells. Excessive PDCD4 expression counteracted the influence of miR-21 on cell
death and proliferation. The data indicated that PDCD4 played a regulatory role in ROS generation, which is reportedly involved in
apoptosis. Therefore, ciRS-126 reduction in PCOS granulosa cells targeted the miR-21-PDCD4 axis to reduce proliferation and
promote apoptosis. CiRS-126 shows potential as a promising predictor of clinical outcome as well as a therapeutic target in PCOS.

"Fire and high summer soil temperatures can break physical seed dormancy in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems. Their independent effect is somewhat recognized but both factors may act together with a synergistic effect yet unknown. This study aims to determine the isolated and combined effects of fire and summer temperatures on the release of physical seed dormancy in Cistaceae species. Fire and summer temperature treatments were applied in a factorial experiment to seeds of 12 species of Cistaceae. Seeds previously exposed or not to a heat shock (fire simulation) were kept for 1 or 2 months at constant or alternating temperatures (summer temperatures simulation). Additionally, I compared the effect of exposing the seeds to a heat shock before or after they had been subjected to the summer temperatures. Heat shock increased germination of all species, but summer temperatures produced different results. When seeds were exposed to summer temperatures after heat shock, germination decreased. This negative effect disappeared when heat shock was simulated at the end of the summer temperatures. Fire and summer temperatures modulate timing of germination in Cistaceae with a joint control on post-fire regeneration. Cycling of sensitivity to physical dormancy release may be the mechanism to explain this fine-tuning, which would ensure germination when environmental conditions are suitable for growth. These results contribute to our understanding of vegetation dynamics and postfire regeneration in Mediterranean ecosystems.

"Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is an endogenous lipid mediator that originated from docosahexaenoic acid that stimulates a bimodal mechanism in the anti-inflammatory activity in addition to regulation of the inflammatory reaction. The study aimed at
assessing the tissue level of RvD1 in psoriasis to study its role in the etiopathogenesis
of psoriasis, studying the action of NB-UVB on the level of resolvin D1 in psoriasis,
and raising the possibility of using resolvin D1 as a new therapy for psoriasis in the
future. This case-control study included 20 psoriasis patients and 20 healthy controls.
Patients took narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) for 36 sessions. Skin biopsies were
taken before and after treatment from patients and from controls to assess the
expression of RvD1 by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our findings revealed a statistically significant difference (P < .001) between psoriasis patients
(either before or after treatment) and controls with lower levels of RvD1 in psoriasis
patients. On comparing the RvD1 levels in psoriasis patients before and after treatment, a statistically significant increase was detected after treatment (P < .001). Tissue RvD1 levels in psoriasis patients were lower than healthy controls and increased
after NB-UVB treatment in psoriasis patients. Thus, it is suggested that RvD1 might
have a role in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis. Moreover, the significantly upregulated tissue levels of RvD1 in patients after treatment with NB-UVB highlighted
a novel mechanism of phototherapy-mediated response in psoriasis by up-regulating
RvD1 level.",0
"Abstract
While research has investigated intimate partner violence (IPV) and food insecurity (FI) as
independent experiences on mental health, research is lacking on the possible longitudinal
associations of combined experiences of IPV and FI on maternal depression and generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD). Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study
(n=1,440), the current study examined the independent and combined associations of IPV and FI
mothers experienced 3-5 years after their child’s birth on depression and GAD at Year 15. Five
mutually exclusive dichotomous variables were created based on IPV and FI experiences during
Year 3 and Year 5. Depression and GAD were measured at Year 15 using the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form. According to the covariate-adjusted logistic
regression models, exposure to IPV and FI, both concurrently and independently predicted greater
depression at Year 15. Mothers in all IPV and FI categories had greater odds of having GAD at
Year 15 compared to those with no exposure. Compared to the independent effect of IPV and FI,
the combined effect of IPV and FI was highly associated with maternal GAD, but not depression.
Using a trauma-informed approach to counseling in combination with food assistance programs
might be an effective strategy in preventing mental health symptoms. ",0
"Abstract. Methyl jasmonate potentially induces the
differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells and inhibits
their proliferation; it may induce the differentiation and
apoptosis of human lymphocytic leukemia cells, but does not
exert a damaging effect on normal lymphocytes. In the present
study, the anticancer effect of methyl jasmonate on human
colorectal cancer cells was investigated. Cell viability and
apoptosis was assessed using a Cell Counting kit-8 assay and
flow cytometry, respectively. Methyl jasmonate suppressed cell
viability and induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer
cells. Additionally, methyl jasmonate increased the activation
of caspase-3, inhibited the expression levels of enhancer
of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2)
and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human colorectal cancer.
Downregulation of EZH2 expression enhanced the anticancer
effect of methyl jasmonate on human colorectal cancer cells
through suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus,
EZH2 downregulation promotes the anticancer effect of
methyl jasmonate by inducing apoptosis in human colorectal
cancer cells through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.",0
"Prematurely born infants face unique risks, and the treatment of imminent preterm birth is thus an

"BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a common stroke sequela, yet their neurobiological substrates are still unclear. We
sought to determine if they are associated with specific lesion locations.
METHODS: In a prospective observational study, 270 patients with stroke were tested twice with the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale around day 6 and again 6 months poststroke and voxel-based lesion behavior mapping was performed.
RESULTS: Frequency of depressive symptoms (depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale >7)
after 6 months was 19.6 %. Higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for depression around day 6 were
the only variable associated with depressive symptoms after 6 months in a multiple logistic regression. Lesions in
the right putamen were significantly associated with depressive symptoms after 6 months in the voxel-based lesion
behavior mapping.
CONCLUSIONS: Lesions in the right basal ganglia might increase the risk of depressive symptoms 6 months poststroke.

"Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a group of viruses with small, circular DNA genomes. Members of this family are thought to
ubiquitously infect humans, although causal disease associations are currently lacking. At present, there is no understanding
of how infection with this diverse group of viruses is so prevalent. Using a combined computational and synthetic approach,
we predict and identify miRNA-coding regions in diverse human TTVs and provide evidence for TTV miRNA production in
vivo. The TTV miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer, and are active in RISC. A TTV
mutant defective for miRNA production replicates as well as wild type virus genome; demonstrating that the TTV miRNA is
dispensable for genome replication in a cell culture model. We demonstrate that a recombinant TTV genome is capable of
expressing an exogenous miRNA, indicating the potential utility of TTV as a small RNA vector. Gene expression profiling of
host cells identifies N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) as a target of a TTV miRNA. NMI transcripts are directly regulated
through a binding site in the 39UTR. SiRNA knockdown of NMI contributes to a decreased response to interferon signaling.
Consistent with this, we show that a TTV miRNA mediates a decreased response to IFN and increased cellular proliferation in
the presence of IFN. Thus, we add Annelloviridae to the growing list of virus families that encode miRNAs, and suggest that
miRNA-mediated immune evasion can contribute to the pervasiveness associated with some of these viruses.",0
"Abstract
Twenty-first birthday drinking is characterized by extreme alcohol consumption. Accumulating
evidence suggests that high-dose bingeing is related to structural brain changes and cognitive
deficits. This is particularly problematic in the transition from adolescence to adulthood when the
brain is still maturing, elevating the brain’s sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol intoxication.
Heavy drinking is associated with reduced structural integrity in the hippocampus and corpus
callosum and is accompanied by cognitive deficits. However, there is little research examining
changes in the human brain related to discrete heavy drinking episodes. The present study
investigated whether alcohol exposure during a 21
st birthday celebration would result in changes
to white matter microstructure by utilizing Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) measures and a
quasi-experimental design. By examining structural changes in the brain from pre- to postcelebration within subjects (N = 49) prospectively, we were able to more directly observe brain
changes following an extreme drinking episode. Region of interest analyses demonstrated
increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the posterior fornix (p < 0.0001) and in the body of the
corpus callosum (p = 0.0029) from pre- to post-birthday celebration. These results suggest acute
white matter damage to the fornix and corpus callosum following an extreme drinking episode,
which is especially problematic during continued neurodevelopment. Twenty-first birthday
drinking may, therefore, be considered an important target event for preventing acute brain
injury in young adults",0
"Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), a complex neuropsychological complication of cirrhosis, is characterized by delayed reaction time and the inhibition of
abnormal response. This network meta-analysis (NMA) was adopted to compare the
efficacy of five drugs including lactulose, probiotics, rifaximin, acetyl-L-carnitine
(ALC), and L-Ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) in the treatment of MHE. The Cochrane
Library, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for any existing entail on
these five drugs from the inception to February 2018, including Randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). The NMA of the five drugs, accounting for both direct and
indirect comparisons to assess WMD (weighted mean difference) and SUCRA
(surface under the cumulative ranking curves) was conducted. In total, 10 RTCS with
826 MHE patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA. The
meta-analysis revealed that compared with placebo, lactulose, and probiotics had
better efficacy in reducing ammonia serum levels and total SIP (Sickness Impact
Profil) score; ALC had better efficacy in lowering serum level of ammonia and
increasing the serum level of albumin; rifaximin and LOLA had better efficacy in
reducing total SIP score. The results from SUCRA revealed that in terms of ammonia
and albumin serums, ALC presented with the highest rankings when it comes to
efficacy (serum ammonia: 87.2%; serum albumin: 92.25%). Hence, the key findings
from the present study highly suggested that ALC had the best efficacy in the
treatment of MHE patients.",0
"Abstract
Background: Infertility affects childbearing age couples all over the world. One of the important reasons for infertility is genetic
factors. Our study evaluated the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and azoospermia.
Methods: Multiple databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and China journal full-text database were used to search
for relevant studies, and full-text articles involved in the evaluation of MTHFR and azoospermia. The results were evaluated using
STATA 12.0. Heterogeneity analysis, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis were also performed on the data.
Results: Thirteen related studies eventually met the inclusion criteria. Significant association between C677T polymorphism and
azoospermia (relative risk [RR]=0.94 [0.90, 0.99], I
2=60.9%, P=.002), and between A1298C polymorphism and azoospermia
(RR=0.98 [0.94, 1.02], I
2=56.3%, P=.011) was observed. Meanwhile, in subgroup analysis, Caucasians had higher risk than
Mongolians in association between MTHFR and azoospermia.
Conclusion: There was association between MTHFR polymorphism and azoospermia. Caucasian populations had higher risk
than Mongolian populations in association between MTHFR and azoospermia.

"Objective: Well-tested and validated theories of suicide can help professionals
understand, predict, and prevent suicide. This article presents two studies testing
the suicidal ideation components of the Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide and
comparing it to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS). We tested the 3ST’s
prediction that high levels of pain and hopelessness lead to suicidal ideation, which
strengthens when pain and hopelessness outweigh connection to life.
Method: Study 1 (n = 204, mean age = 35, 56% female, 83% White) provides an
independent, direct replication of the original analyses. Study 2 (n = 295, mean
age = 25, 75% female, 68% White) presents the first conceptual extension of the
3ST using diverse measures of pain, hopelessness, and connection. In both studies,
participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing the relevant variables.
Results: Both studies largely supported the first two steps of the 3ST, although
adding connection to the model did not account for greater variability of suicidal
ideation. The ITS accounted for comparable or greater amounts of variance in
suicidal ideation than the 3ST.
Conclusions: Both the 3ST and the ITS have utility to explain suicidal ideation.
Limitations and future directions are discussed",0
"This study is designed to investigate the role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) on the proliferation
and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in rat models with focal cerebral infarction (CI). Seventy-five Sprague-Dawlay (SD) rats were
randomly divided into the control, sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), MCAO þ nonsense oligonucleotide (NODN), and
MCAO þ ASODN groups. Proliferation and differentiation of NSCs were detected by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and immunofluorescence
staining, respectively. ELISA was performed to detect the expressions of endogenous factors that include insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), transforming growth factor-a1 (TGF-a1), bFGF,
and nerve growth factor (NGF). Results show significant neurological deficits and focal CI in the MCAO and MCAO þ NODN groups. An
obvious increase of NSC proliferation, reactive proliferation of astrocytes in CI areas, differentiation of newly proliferated NSCs into mature
neuronal cells, and expressions of endogenous growth factors exhibited in the MCAO, MCAO þ NODN and MCAO þ ASODN groups. Compared
to the MCAO and MACO þ NODN groups, the MCAO þ ASODN group showed a significant decrease NSC proliferation and differentiation in CI
areas as well as decrease expressions of endogenous growth factors. These findings may offer insight to help us understand more as to how
bFGF ASODN can effectively suppress the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. These findings are expected to help contribute to research
for new targets in the treatment of focal CI. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3875–3882, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
"Abstract
Purpose Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common infection in children, generally caused by viral respiratory
infection. Vitamin C is currently proposed as prophylaxis for URTI. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness
of vitamin C administration in children for the prevention and reduced duration of URTI through a systematic literature review.
Methods Review of the literature conducted between October 2017 and January 2018 in the main medical databases
(CENTRAL, Medline and Embase) and by a gray literature approach. The selection criteria were: double-blind randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamin C use to placebo in children aged 3 months to 18 years without chronic infection.
Efficacy was assessed in terms of incidence, duration and severity of symptoms of URTI. A meta-analysis was conducted where
possible.
Results Eight RCTs, including 3135 children aged 3 months to 18 years, were selected. Quantitative analysis showed no
difference between vitamin C administration and placebo (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% CI [0.54–1.03], p = 0.07, I2 = 74%). Vitamin
C administration was found to decrease the duration of URTI by 1.6 days (standardized mean differences = −0.30 [−0.53; −0.08],
p = 0.009, I2 = 70%). Children under 6 years of age benefit from more effective vitamin C supplementation associated with
echinacea. No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions Although no preventive effects were found, vitamin C intake reduced the duration of URTI. Considering the
frequency of URTI, the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, and the safe nature of vitamin C, its supplementation is justified,
especially in children under 6 years of age and those who present a high frequency of URTI. There is a sound rationale for further
trials with greater statistical power among children of this age.",0
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding
RNA sex determination region of Y chromosome
(SRY)-related HMG-box (SOX) is involved in the
development of various cancers. However, the
molecular mechanism of SOXOT, an overlapping transcript of SOX, in pancreatic cancer (PC)
is still undefined. We aimed to explore the epigenetic function of SOX2OT and its downstream
factors in advanced PC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The levels of SOX2OT, miRNA, and DEK proto-oncogene (DEK) in
pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines were
evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The log-rank test was applied to
evaluate the role of high SOX2OT levels in shortening the overall survival of pancreatic cancer
patients. The Chi-squared test was made to assess the relation between SOX2OT expression
and clinicopathological features of PC patients.
Colony assay tested the cell proliferation of PC
cells with SOX2OT knockdown. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to determine
the stemness of tumor cells in vitro. The underlying regulatory mechanism between SOX2OT
and miR-200a/141 was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by RNA transfection, qPCR, and
Western blotting. Mice xenograft models were
applied to determine the promoting effects of
SOX2OT on PC in vivo.
RESULTS: The expression of SOX2OT in PC
tissues and cell lines is strongly elevated. High
levels of SOX2OT expression are more likely to present in patients with advanced TNM
stage, positive CD44, and poor overall survival. SOX2OT overexpression promotes proliferation and stemness maintaining of PC cells in
vitro and boosts tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, SOX2OT upregulates DEK expression by
binding to miR-200a/141 as a competing endogenous RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: DEK induced by SOXOTmiR-200a/141 axis may markedly promote stem
cell property of PC, resulting in an advanced
stage and inferior survival. These findings suggest the SOX2OT-DEK axis as a novel therapeutic target in PC.",0
"Rationale: Direct evidence for persistence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) during asymptomatic latent tuberculosis infection
(LTBI) in humans is currently lacking. Moreover, although a 12-week
regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP) is currently
recommended by the CDC as treatment for LTBI, experimental
evidence for 3HP-mediated clearance of persistent Mtb infection
in human lungs has not been established.
Objectives: Using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of TB, we
sought to assess 3HP treatment–mediated clearance of Mtb infection
in latently infected macaques.
Methods: Sixteen NHPs were infected via inhalation with z10 cfu
of Mtb CDC1551, after which asymptomatic animals were either
treated with 3HP or left untreated. Pharmacokinetics of the 3HP
regimen were measured. Following treatment, animals were
coinfected with simian immunodeficiency virus to assess reactivation
of LTBI and development of active TB disease.
Measurements and Main Results: Fourteen NHPs
remained free of clinical signs or microbiological evidence of
active TB following infection with Mtb and were subsequently
either treated with 3HP (n = 7) or left untreated (n = 7).
Untreated NHPs were asymptomatic for 7 months but
harbored persistent Mtb infection, as shown by reactivation
of latent infection following simian immunodeficiency
virus coinfection. However, none of the treated
animals developed TB reactivation disease, and they
remained without clinical or microbiological evidence of
persistent bacilli, suggesting treatment-mediated clearance
of bacteria.
Conclusions: Mtb can persist in asymptomatic macaques for at
least 7 months. Furthermore, 3HP treatment effectively cleared
bacteria and prevented reactivation of TB in latently infected
macaques.

"Abstract: Layered two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), as an outstanding MXene member, has
captured increasing attention in supercapacitor applications due to its excellent chemical and physical
properties. However, the low gravimetric capacitance of Ti3C2Tx restricts its rapid development in
such applications. Herein, this work demonstrates an effective and facile hydrothermal approach
to synthesize nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx with greatly improved gravimetric
capacitance and excellent cycling stability. The hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) in hydrothermal
environment acted as the nitrogen source and intercalants, while the Ti3C2Tx itself was the titanium
source of TiO2 and TiN. We tested the optimized nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx
electrodes in H2SO4, Li2SO4, Na2SO4, LiOH and KOH electrolytes, respectively. The electrode in
H2SO4 electrolyte delivered the best electrochemical performance with high gravimetric capacitance
of 361 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 85.8% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.
A systematic study of material characterization combined with the electrochemical performances
disclosed that TiO2/TiN nanoparticles, the introduction of nitrogen and the NH4
+ intercalation
efficaciously increased the specific surface areas, which is beneficial for facilitating electrolyte ions
transportation. Given the excellent performance, nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx
bodes well as a promising pseudocapacitor electrode for energy storage applications.",0
"Objective: This study aimed to describe the mechanism of exosome-derived miR-486-
5p underlying the cell cycle and progression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
Methods: Bioinformatics methods were applied for identifying the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) in the GEO-LUAD dataset, predicting where the potential target
miRNA was expressed and exploring the corresponding downstream target mRNA.
qRT-PCR was conducted to detect the levels of the target genes in cancer cells.
Thereafter, a series of in vitro experiments were performed for cell activities evaluation,
including CCK-8, EdU, colony formation assay and transwell. Besides, Western blot
was applied to determine the protein levels of the migration and invasion-related
factors (NEK2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, MMP-2, and MMP-9). Dual-luciferase
reporter gene assay was employed for validating the targeted relationship between
the target genes. Furthermore, nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment was
conducted to further validate the role of the target miRNA in tumor development, and
immunohistochemistry was used for Ki67 detection and TUNEL was applied for cell
apoptosis assay.
Results: miR-486-5p was observed to be enriched in serum exosomes, and seen
to be significantly down-regulated in cancer tissues as well as in cancer serum
exosomes. It was proven that exosomes could release miR-486-5p, thus regulating
LUAD progression and affecting cell cycle. Moreover, NEK2 was identified as a target of
miR-486-5p both in vivo and in vitro. Enrichment analysis revealed that NEK2 was mainly
activated in cell cycle and mitosis-related pathways. Meanwhile, NEK2 was found to
present significant difference in different TNM stages. Furthermore, rescue experiments
indicated that the inhibitory effect of miR-486-5p overexpression on LUAD progression
could be abrogated when miR-486-5p and NEK2 were simultaneously up-regulated.
Conclusion: Exosome-derived miR-486-5p is responsible for cell cycle arrest as well
as the inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis in LUAD via targeting NEK2.",0
"Abstract
Background
Loss-of-function mutations in the skin barrier protein filaggrin (FLG) are a major risk for atopic dermatitis (AD). The pathogenic sequence of disturbances in skin barrier function before or during the early development of AD is not fully understood. A more detailed understanding of these events is needed to develop a clearer picture of disease pathogenesis. A robust, noninvasive test to identify babies at high risk of AD would be important in planning early intervention and/or prevention studies.

Objectives
To ascertain whether a noninvasive measurement of skin barrier function at day 2 after birth and at 2 months predicts the development of AD at 1 year. Furthermore, to determine whether increases in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) predate the development of clinical AD.

Methods
A total of 1903 infants were enrolled in the Cork Babies After Scope: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact Using Neurological and Nutritional Endpoints Birth Cohort study from July 2009 to October 2011. Measurements of TEWL were made at birth (day 2) and at 2 and 6 months. The presence of AD was ascertained at 6 and 12 months, and disease severity was assessed by using the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis clinical tool at 6 months and by using both the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis clinical tool and Nottingham Severity Score at 12 months. A total of 1300 infants were genotyped for FLG mutations.

Results
At 6 months, 18.7% of the children had AD, and at 12 months, 15.53%. In a logistic regression model, day 2 upper quartile TEWL measurement was significantly predictive of AD at 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81; P < .05). Lowest quartile day 2 TEWL was protective against AD at 12 months. An upper quartile 2 month TEWL was also strongly predictive of AD at 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84; P < .05). At both ages, this effect was independent of parental atopy, FLG status, or report of an itchy flexural rash at 2 months. Associations were increased when parental atopy status or child FLG mutation status was added into the linear regression model.

Conclusions
Impairment of skin barrier function at birth and at 2 months precedes clinical AD. In addition to providing important mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis, these findings have implications for the optimal timing of interventions for the prevention of AD.",0
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Reduced expression
of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)
is associated with a variety of tumors. The elevated miR-155 expression is associated with the
onset of pancreatic cancer. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a targeted relation between miR155 and the 3'-UTR of SOCS3. This study investigated whether miR-155 regulates SOCS3 expression and affects the biological effects of
pancreatic cancer cells.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: QRT-PCR was
used to detect the expression of miR-155 and
SCOS3 mRNA in tumor tissues and paracancerous tissues of patients with pancreatic cancer.
The dual luciferase reporter gene assay validated the target interaction between miR-155 and
SOCS3. Pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 cells
were divided into miR-NC group and miR-155
inhibitor group followed by an analysis of the
expressions of SOCS3, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3,
cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, and cell proliferation by EdU staining.
RESULTS: Compared with adjacent tissues,
miR-155 expression was increased in tumor tissues of patients with pancreatic cancer, and
SOCS3 expression was decreased. There was a
targeted regulatory relationship between miR155 and SOCS3 mRNA. Compared with HPDE6-C7 cells, miR-155 expression in pancreatic cancer SW1990 and Capan-1 cells was increased, and SOCS3 expression was decreased.
Transfection of miR-155 inhibitor significantly
increased SOCS3 expression in pancreatic cancer SW1990 cells, decreased the expression of
p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, increased cell apoptosis,
and decreased cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased miR-155 expression and decreased SOCS3 expression are related to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.
miR-155 inhibits the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells by inhibition of
SOCS3 expression.",0
"Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is often assumed to be
one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly
and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian
herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life
stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that
involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides
and exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types
to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We
found that distance- and density-dependent mortality caused by natural enemies was most likely at the seedling stage and was greater at higher mean
annual temperatures. Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence
at the seedling stage is significantly weakened when fungicides were applied.
By contrast, negative conspecific distance- and density-dependence is not a
general pattern at the seed stage. High seed mass reduced distance- and
density-dependent mortality at the seed stage. Seed studies excluding only
large mammals found significant negative conspecific distance-dependent
mortality, but exclusion of all mammals resulted in a non-significant effect
of conspecifics. Our study suggests that plant pathogens are a major cause
of distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, while the
impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed
stage, large and small mammals, respectively, weaken and enhance negative
conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify
specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different
enemy types and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and
thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.",0
"Deciphering the mechanisms involved in shaping social structure is key to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes leading to sociality. Individual specialization within groups can increase colony efficiency and consequently productivity. Here, we test the hypothesis that within-group variation in individual personalities (i.e. boldness and aggression) can shape task differentiation. The social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae) showed task differentiation (significant unequal participation) in simulated prey capture events across 10-day behavioural assays in the field, independent of developmental stage (level of maturation), eliminating age polyethism. Participation in prey capture was positively associated with level of boldness but not with aggression. Body size positively correlated with being the first spider to emerge from the colony as a response to prey capture but not with being the first to attack, and dispersal distance from experimental colonies correlated with attacking but not with emerging. This suggests that different behavioural responses to prey capture result from a complex set of individual characteristics. Boldness and aggression correlated positively, but neither was associated with body size, developmental stage or dispersal distance. Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social spider independent of age and maturation. Our results suggest that personality measures obtained in solitary, standardized laboratory settings can be reliable predictors of behaviour in a social context in the field. Given the wealth of organisms that show consistent individual behavioural differences, animal personality could play a role in social organization in a diversity of animals.",0
"Abstract. The present systematic review and meta‑analysis
investigated the association between exposure to radiofre‑

studies that were available in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane
Library, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science,
Airiti Library, Networked Digital Library of Theses and
Dissertations and ProQuest until May 2020 were investi‑
gated. A total of eight studies (four case‑control and four
cohort studies) were eligible for quantitative analysis. A
significant association between radiofrequency radiation
exposure and breast cancer risk was detected [pooled relative
risk (RR)=1.189; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.056‑1.339].
Subgroup analyses indicated that radiofrequency radiation
exposure significantly increased the risk of breast cancer
susceptibility among subjects aged ≥50 years (RR=2.179;
95% CI, 1.260‑3.770). Pooled estimates revealed that the use
of electrical appliances, which emit radiofrequency radiation,
such as mobile phones and computers, significantly increased
breast cancer development (RR=2.057; 95% CI, 1.272‑3.327),
while occupational radiofrequency exposure and transmitters
did not increase breast cancer development (RR=1.274; 95%
CI, 0.956‑1.697; RR=1.133; 95% CI, 0.987‑1.300, respectively).
It was concluded that radiofrequency radiation exposure
significantly increased the risk of breast cancer, especially in
women aged ≥50 years and in individuals who used electric
appliances, such as mobile phones and computers. In accor‑
dance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta‑analysis, an evaluation protocol was prepared

"Introduction. Malpositioning of the implant results in polyethylene wear and loosing of implant afer total knee arthroplasty.
Scanogram is ofen used for measurement of limb alignment. Computer navigation provides real time measurements and thus,
the aim is to see any association pre- and postoperatively between coronal alignments measured on scanogram to computer
navigation during total knee arthroplasty. Material and Methods. We prospectively gathered data of 200 patients with advanced
degenerative symptomatic arthritis, who were consecutively selected for primary total knee arthroplasty with computer navigation.
Every patient’s pre- and postoperative scanogram were compared to the intraoperative computer navigation fndings. Results. Te
results show that the preoperative mean mechanical axis on navigation was 10.65∘ (SD ± 6.95) and on scanogram it was 10.38∘ (SD
± 6.89). On the other hand, the mean postoperative mechanical axis on navigation was 0.69∘ (SD ± 0.87) and on scanogram it was
2.73∘ (SD ± 2.10). Preoperatively, there was no signifcant diference (p value = 0.46) between the two. However, the postoperative
outcomes suggest that there was a noteworthy diference, with no correlation between the mean Hip-Knee Ankle Axis (HKA)
and intraoperative mechanical axis (p value <0.0001). Conclusion. Postoperative mechanical alignment values afer total knee
arthroplasty are lower on navigation than measured on standing full length hip to ankle scanogram",0
"Hydrostatin-SN1 (peptide sequence, DEQHLETELHTLTSVLTANGFQ), a kind of peptides extracted from snake venom, has been
reported to have anti-inflammatory effect, but its truncated mutant hydrostatin-SN10 (peptide sequence, DEQHLETELH) on
pancreatitis-induced acute lung injury has not been well documented. Interleukin- (IL-) 6-induced Janus Kinase 2/Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway is involved with inflammatory and oxidative stress
activities and may be associated with the pathogenesis of lung injury, and related molecules were measured. Taurocholateinduced pancreatitis associated with acute lung injury was established and treated with hydrostatin-SN10. Pancreatitis was
confirmed by measuring the serum levels of amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen and urinary amylase. Lung injury was determined
by histologically assessing acinar cell changes. The related molecules of IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT3-associated inflammation and
oxidative stress were quantitated by real time-PCR, Western blot, and/or immunochemical assay. Hydrostatin-SN10 reduced the
levels of serum amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen and urinary amylase when compared with the model group (p < 0:05).
Hydrostatin-SN10 significantly inhibited the IL-6-stimulated JAK2/STAT3 pathway and reduced the number of apoptotic cells
via the downregulation of caspase 3 and BAX (proapoptotic) and upregulation of Bcl2 (antiapoptotic) (p < 0:05). IL-6 induced
the increase in the levels of JAK2 and STAT3, which was reversed by hydrostatin-SN10 treatment (p < 0:05). In addition,
hydrostatin-SN10 reduced the expression of IL-6 and TNF- (tumor necrosis factor-) α and increased the level of IL-10 (p < 0:05).
On the other hand, hydrostatin-SN10 treatment increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione
(GSH) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p < 0:05). These results suggest that
hydrostatin-SN10 may inhibit pancreatitis-induced acute lung injury by affecting IL-6-mediated JAK2/STAT3 pathwayassociated inflammation and oxidative stress",0
"Abstract
Understanding the pharmacological similarity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is paramount to predicting ligand off-target effects, drug repurposing, and ligand discovery for orphan receptors. Phylogenetic relationships do not always correctly capture pharmacological similarity. Previous family-wide attempts to define pharmacological relationships were based on three-dimensional structures and/or known receptor:ligand pairings, both unavailable for orphan GPCRs. Here, we present GPCR-CoINPocket, a novel contact-informed neighboring pocket metric of GPCR binding site similarity that is informed by patterns of ligand:residue interactions observed in crystallographically-characterized GPCRs. GPCR-CoINPocket is applicable to receptors with unknown structure or ligands and accurately captures known pharmacological relationships between GPCRs, even those undetected by phylogeny. When applied to orphan receptor GPR37L1, GPCR-CoINPocket identified its pharmacological neighbors, and transfer of their pharmacology aided discovery of the first surrogate ligands for this orphan with a 30% success rate. Although primarily designed for GPCRs, the method is easily transferable to other protein families.

Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are well-established therapeutic targets, yet a subgroup of them remains largely unexplored – orphan GPCRs. One of the main obstacles to understanding the therapeutic potential of orphan GPCRs is the absence of a cognate ligand, which is identified through ‘deorphanization’1. While finding the endogenous ligand is of paramount importance, much can be learned by the identification of even low potency small molecule surrogate ligands. The propensity of ligands to display ‘off-target’ activities provides rationale for surrogate ligand searches by screening clinically tested small molecules2–4. Nevertheless, screening campaigns remain expensive and often inaccessible to academic research, while structure-based drug design at orphan GPCRs is still in its infancy5. Thus, alternative approaches to surrogate ligand identification are required.

Given that a number of homology-related receptor subgroups, such as the muscarinic or adrenergic receptors, share endogenous and often small molecule ligands, pharmacologically-characterized receptors that are homologous to an orphan GPCR in question represent an obvious source of surrogate ligand candidates. Such homologs are traditionally determined by sequence alignment and calculation of amino acid identity or similarity at each position. Phylogenetic relationships are largely sensible6 and underlie classification systems for the wider GPCR superfamily7; however, they are not always predictive of pharmacological similarities. Phylogenetically-unrelated GPCRs frequently share ligands; for example, astemizole, an antagonist of the bioaminergic histamine H1 receptor, also antagonizes the somatostatin peptide receptor (sst) 5, sst58,9. On the other hand, homology-related receptors frequently differ substantially in their ligand selectivity (exemplified by the chemokine receptor subfamily10).

A breakthrough in understanding pharmacological relatedness of GPCRs came from arranging GPCRs by their ligand similarities11. This chemogenomics approach not only explained known ‘off-target’ effects of certain ligands, but also predicted relationships unseen by phylogeny alone. These newly-predicted relationships were experimentally validated, extending previous computational efforts to organize GPCRs by their ligand similarity12. Although a major advance in the field, the approach cannot identify pharmacological neighbors for orphan GPCRs because it relies upon existing ligand:receptor pairings.

Intuitively, pharmacological similarity of GPCRs implies similar binding-site features. However, various attempts at organizing GPCRs by binding site comparisons largely reproduced phylogenetic relationships11–15. This may reflect shortcomings in the definitions of the binding site, which lack sufficient texture to reveal the true ligand interaction pharmacophores. Here we sought to further refine the comparisons of GPCR binding sites by analyzing both the persistence and strength of residue:ligand interactions observed across the GPCR Pocketome – the set of annotated GPCR binding pockets that have been crystallographically characterized to date16. By enriching the binding site comparisons with ligand contact strengths, a method we term GPCR-CoINPocket (GPCR contact-informed neighboring pocket), we organized and clustered all Class A GPCRs into a hierarchical structure that closely reproduced previously characterized pharmacological relationships. Furthermore, we discovered the first surrogate ligands for the orphan receptor GPR37L1 by transferring pharmacology of its neighbors identified by GPCR-CoINPocket. Hence, our approach not only complements the phylogenetic and pharmacological organization of GPCRs, but also uniquely enables the discovery of surrogate ligands for orphan receptors.",0
"Abstract
The ether à go-go1 (Eag1) channel is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. However, the expression and function of Eag1 in liposarcoma are poorly understood. In the present study, the mRNA expression of Eag1 in different adipose tissue samples was examined by real-time PCR. Then, the protein expression of Eag1 in 131 different adipose tissues from 109 patients was detected by immunohistochemistry. Next, the associations between Eag1 expression and clinicopathological features of liposarcoma were analyzed. In addition, the effects of Eag1 on liposarcoma cell proliferation and cycle were evaluated by CCK-8, colony formation, xenograft mouse model, and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was detected by Western blot analysis to explain the detailed mechanisms of oncogenic potential of Eag1 in liposarcoma. It was found that Eag1 was aberrantly expressed in over 67% liposarcomas, with a higher frequency than in lipoma, hyperplasia, inflammation, and normal adipose tissues. However, Eag1 expression was not correlated with clinicopathological features of liposarcoma. Eag1 inhibitor imipramine or Eag1-shRNA significantly suppressed the proliferation of liposarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanying with accumulation of cells in the G1 phase. These results suggest that Eag1 plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and cell cycle of liposarcoma cells and might be a potential therapeutic target for liposarcoma.",0

"Abstract
No data support the suggestion that first-trimester dydrogesterone use increases the risk of fetal abnormalities; however, two low-quality retrospective studies (one retracted by the journal) have suggested such a link. A scoping review and meta-analysis were carried out to address this discrepancy. The literature was reviewed but it was not possible to identify any evidence of a plausible mechanism for potential causality between dydrogesterone and fetal abnormalities. To investigate whether any evidence existed, a preliminary meta-analysis was undertaken of clinical studies published since 2005 on first-trimester dydrogesterone use with assessment of fetal abnormalities. A fixed effects model was used to determine pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). From 83 articles identified, six randomized controlled trials were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for maternal dydrogesterone use and fetal abnormalities gave a RR approaching 1 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.57, 1.62), confirming previous conclusions of no causal association between fetal abnormalities and first-trimester dydrogesterone use. Physicians, scientists and journal reviewers should exercise due diligence to prevent promulgation of retracted data. We are confident in using dydrogesterone, if indicated, in the treatment of threatened or recurrent miscarriage, and believe that its favourable safety profile should extend to its appropriate use in assisted reproductive technologies.",0

Background
Obesity is a global disease with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese according to the world health organization figures. This paper aims to explore the links between obesity and mortality in COVID-19.

Methods
Electronic search was made for the papers studying obesity as a risk factor for mortality following COVID-19 infection. Three authors independently selected the papers and agreed for final inclusion. The outcomes were the age, gender, body mass index, severe comorbidities, respiratory support and the critical illness related mortality in COVID-19. 572 publications were identified and 42 studies were selected including one unpublished study data. Only 14 studies were selected for quantitative analysis.

Results
All the primary points but the gender are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality. The age >70, [odd ratio (OR): 0.17, CI; 95%, P-value: <0.00001], gender [OR: 0.89; CI: 95%, P-value: 0.32], BMI > 25 kg/m2 [OR: 3.68, CI: 95%, P-value: <0.003], severe comorbidities [OR: 1.84, CI:95%, P-value: <0.00001], advanced respiratory support [OR: 6.98, CI: 95%, P-value: <0.00001], and critical illness [OR: 2.03, CI: 95%, P-value: <0.00001].

Conclusions
Patients with obesity are at high risk of mortality from COVID-19 infection.",0

Background
Stem cell therapy is a potential strategy to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, several practical limitations remain. As such, finding the appropriate stem cell remains the primary issue in regenerative medicine today. We isolated a pre-placental pluripotent stem cell from the chorionic villi of women with early tubal ectopic pregnancies. Our objectives in this study were (i) to identify the characteristics of hTS cells as a potential cell source for therapy; and (ii) to test if hTS cells can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD.

Methods and Findings
hTS cells expressed gene markers of both the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). hTS cells exhibited genetic and biological characteristics similar to that of hES cells, yet genetically distinct from placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) efficiently induced hTS cells into trophoblast neural stem cells (tNSCs) in 1-day. Overexpression of transcription factor Nanog was possibly achieved through a RA-induced non-genomic c-Src/Stat3/Nanog signaling pathway mediated by the subcellular c-Src mRNA localization for the maintenance of pluripotency in tNSCs. tNSC transplantation into the lesioned striatum of acute and chronic PD rats not only improved behavioral deficits but also regenerated dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, evidenced by immunofluorescent and immunohistological analyses at 18-weeks. Furthermore, tNSCs showed immunological advantages for the application in regenerative medicine.

Conclusions
We successfully isolated and characterized the unique ectopic pregnancy-derived hTS cells. hTS cells are pluripotent stem cells that can be efficiently induced to tNSCs with positive results in PD rat models. Our data suggest that the hTS cell is a dynamic stem cell platform that is potentially suitable for use in disease models, drug discovery, and cell therapy such as PD.",0
"Abstract
Objectives: Investigate and identify the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance measured by using different cognitive tests taken from Cambridge Brain Science (CBS).

Methods: Thirty subjects, divided into two groups (aerobic and effort), undergo twelve cognitive tests from CBS. A comparison between the pre- and post-exercise results in terms of cognitive performance differences is carried out. Regression analysis between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features and CBS tests results is performed.

Results: In most CBS tests, there is an improvement, or at least a confirmation, of the subject's cognitive ability, for both groups. Reasoning (80–100%), concentration (80–87%), and planning tests (93–100%) seem to undergo critical positive changes. The regression analysis, performed by using a set of different algorithms, has demonstrated that it is possible, by monitoring the HRV during the exercise, to predict to some extent the cognitive performance, i.e., the CBS tests results. The best performing regression algorithms are Simple Linear (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.098, effort group: 3.350, both groups: 2.747) and REPTree (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.955, effort group: 3.315, both groups: 3.121). The statistical analysis has proved that physical activity is statistically useful for the subjects in improving their cognitive performance.

Conclusions: This study has numerically appraised the improvement, the conservation, or the worsening on different aspects of cognition. The found mathematical relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance suggests that it is possible to predict the beneficial effect of various exercises on executive and attentive control.

■ Selection mechanisms that dynamically gate only relevant
perceptual information for further processing and sustained
representation in working memory are critical for goal-directed
behavior. We examined whether this gating process can be
modulated by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) over left dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC)—a region known
to play a key role in working memory and conscious access.
Specifically, we examined the effects of tDCS on the magnitude
of the so-called “attentional blink” (AB), a deficit in identifying
the second of two targets presented in rapid succession. Thirtyfour participants performed a standard AB task before (baseline), during, and after 20 min of 1-mA anodal and cathodal
tDCS in two separate sessions. On the basis of previous reports
linking individual differences in AB magnitude to individual differences in DLPFC activity and on suggestions that effects of
tDCS depend on baseline brain activity levels, we hypothesized
that anodal tDCS over left DLPFC would modulate the magnitude of the AB as a function of individual baseline AB magnitude. Indeed, individual differences’ analyses revealed that
anodal tDCS decreased the AB in participants with a large baseline AB but increased the AB in participants with a small baseline AB. This effect was only observed during (but not after)
stimulation, was not found for cathodal tDCS, and could not
be explained by regression to the mean. Notably, the effects
of tDCS were not apparent at the group level, highlighting
the importance of taking individual variability in performance
into account when evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS. These
findings support the idea that left DLPFC plays a critical role in
the AB and in conscious access more generally. They are also in
line with the notion that there is an optimal level of prefrontal
activity for cognitive function, with both too little and too much
activity hurting performance. ■",0

Background
In order to explore the possibility of treating breast cancer by local photo-therapy, a photothermal agents loaded in situ hydrogel was established. In detail, The Cu2MnS2 nanoplates were prepared by one-pot synthesis and, the thermosensitive Pluronic F127 was used as the hydrogel matrix. The Cu2MnS2 nanoplates and the hydrogel were characterized by morphous, particle size, serum stability, photothermal performance upon repeated 808 nm laser irradiation as well as the rheology features. The therapeutic effects of the Cu2MnS2 nanoplates and the hydrogel were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells. The retention, photothermal efficacy, therapeutic effects and systemic toxicity of the hydrogel were assessed in tumor bearing mouse model.

Results
The Cu2MnS2 nanoplates with a diameter of about 35 nm exhibited satisfying serum stability, photo-heat conversion ability and repeated laser exposure stability. The hydrogel encapsulation did not negatively influence the above features of the photothermal agent. The nanoplates loaded in situ hydrogel shows a phase transition at body temperature and, as a result, a long retention in vivo.

Conclusions
The photothermal agent embedded hydrogel played a promising photothermal therapeutic effects in tumor bearing mouse model with low systemic toxicity after peritumoral administration.",0
"Abstract
We report a facile design of an ultra-thin broadband metamaterial absorber (MA) for C-band applications by utilizing a single layer of a metal-dielectric-metal structure of FR-4 substrate. The absorption performances are characterized using a numerical method. The proposed MA exhibits the broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with absorptivity above 90% and the high absorptivity is remained over 80% for a large incident angle up to 40° under both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations over the band. The origin of absorption mechanism is explained by the electric and surface current distributions, which is also supported by the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for C-band applications.",0

Background
One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) has exponentially increased in the last decade, as it is associated with very low complications, mortality, readmissions and reoperations rates, and shows excellent short- and long-term benefits of weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short- and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution.

Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed.

Results
600 patients were included in the study, 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5 years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 5 years (p < 0.001, respectively). At 5 years, OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (p = 0.027), HT (p = 0.006), and DL (p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (p < 0.001).

Conclusion
OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 5 years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB. RYGB and SG obtain similar T2DM and HT remissions, but RYGB reaches significantly greater rates of DL remission. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03467646.",0
"Prior research indicates that disguise negatively affects lineup identifications, but the mechanisms by
which disguise works have not been explored, and different disguises have not been compared. In two
experiments (Ns _x0001_ 87 and 91) we manipulated degree of coverage by two different types of disguise: a
stocking mask or sunglasses and toque (i.e., knitted hat). Participants viewed mock-crime videos
followed by simultaneous or sequential lineups. Disguise and lineup type did not interact. In support of
the view that disguise prevents encoding, identification accuracy generally decreased with degree of
disguise. For the stocking disguise, however, full and 2/3 coverage led to approximately the same rate
of correct identifications—which suggests that disrupting encoding of specific features may be as
detrimental as disrupting a whole face. Accuracy was most affected by sunglasses and we discuss the role
metacognitions may have played. Lineup selections decreased more slowly than accuracy as coverage by
disguise increased, indicating witnesses are insensitive to the effect of encoding conditions on accuracy.
We also explored the impact of disguise and lineup type on witnesses’ confidence in their lineup
decisions, though the results were not straightforward.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of microRNA-130a (miR-130a) in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
syndrome (OSAHS)-associated pulmonary hypertension (PHT) by targeting the growth arrest-specific homeobox (GAX) gene.
Methods: A total of 108 patients with OSAHS-associated PHT were recruited as the OSAHS-associated PHT group and 110
healthy individuals were randomly selected as the normal control group. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
selected and divided into the control, miR-130a mimic, mimic negative control (NC), miR-130a inhibitor, and inhibitor-NC groups. The
dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to identify the relationship between miR-130a and the GAX gene. The quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were applied for the relative expressions of miR-130a and the
mRNA and protein expressions of GAX. Serum levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide
(NO), and super oxide dismutase (SOD) were detected. Cell apoptosis and angiogenic activity were analyzed by flow cytometry and
cell tube formation assay.
Results: GAX was a target gene of miR-130a. Compared with the normal control group, the relative expression of miR-130a and
the serum levels of ET-1 and VEGF were increased, whereas the mRNA expression of GAX and the serum levels of NO and SOD were
decreased in the OSAHS-associated PHT group. Compared with the control, mimic-NC, and inhibitor-NC groups, the relative
expressions of miR-130a in the miR-130a mimic group were enhanced, whereas the expression of miR-130a in the miR-130a
inhibitor group was reduced. However, the mRNA and protein expressions of GAX showed an opposite trend in the miR-130a mimic
and miR-130a inhibitor groups. In comparison to the control, mimic-NC, and inhibitor-NC groups, the miR-130a mimic group had an
increase of ET-1 and VEGF expressions, whereas the expressions of NO and SOD were reduced. However, the miR-130a inhibitor
group exhibited an opposite trend. The apoptosis rate and tube formation number in the miR-130a mimic group were obviously
increased, whereas the miR-130a inhibitor group showed an obvious decrease.
Conclusion: These data provided strong evidence that miR-130a may be involved in the progression of OSAHS-associated PHT
by down-regulating GAX gene.

"Abstract
There is evidence that human decision-making is affected by current body energy levels and physiological states. There is less clear evidence linking decision-making to long-term changes in energy, as those associated with obesity. We explore the link between energy, obesity and dishonesty by comparing the behaviour of obese and lean subjects when hungry or sated while playing an anonymous die-under-cup task. Participants performed the task either before or after breakfast. We find that short-term switches in energy have only a mild effect on dishonesty, as only lean females lie less when sated. By contrast, obese subjects lie more than lean subjects in both conditions, and they lie more to avoid the lowest payoff than to get the highest payoff. Our findings suggest that the observed patterns are more likely mediated by factors associated with obesity than by short term energy dynamics, and call for a better integration of the psychological, economic and biological drivers of moral behaviour.",0
"To explore the effect of microRNA-26b (miR-26b) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, we
investigated the mRNA levels of miR-26b in 4 NSCLC cell lines and 10 clinical samples from human

that miR-26b was significantly down-regulated in both NSCLC cells and human carcinoma tissues.
Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to up-regulate or down-regulate miR-26b in NSCLC cell lines
H1299 and A549 cells. Results showed that both down-regulating and up-regulating miR-26b had no
effect on cancer cell proliferation in H1299 or A549 cells, whereas miR-26b over-expression increased
cancer cell migration and reduced cisplatin chemosensitivity. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was confirmed to be directly bound by miR-26b by dual-luciferase reporter assay, and
was down-regulated in miR-26b over-expressing NSCLC cells. Finally, when PTEN was up-regulated
in NSCLC cells, it reversed the effects of miR-2b over-expression on NSCLC migration and cisplatin
chemosensitivity. In conclusion, our data showed a functional mechanism of miR-26b in regulating

"Abstract
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a serine/threonine-kinase with two doublecortin (DCX) domains. DCLK1 is associated with microtubules via DCX domains and regulates microtubule polymerization. DCLK1 is known to be expressed in cancer stem cells and provides cancer cells with tumor-initiating capacity. Accumulating clinical evidence supports that DCLK1 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and is an important prognostic marker in various human cancers. However, the mechanism, by which DCLK1 causes oncogenesis, is not yet elucidated. In this study, we showed that DCLK1 empowers human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells to form spheres under floating condition in serum-free medium, which are reminiscent of mammospheres formed by mammary epithelial stem cells. We demonstrated that DCLK1 causes chromatin instability in MCF10A cells. DCLK1 impairs DNA repairs in human colon cancer HCT116 and lung cancer H1299 cells. The kinase-negative DCLK1 mutant and the mutant that is not associated with microtubules compromise DNA repair. In conclusion, DCLK1 interferes with DNA repair and induces tumorigenesis through genomic instability and this function is independent of the kinase activity and the regulation of microtubules.",0

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of time resolved magnetic resonance angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectory (TWIST) using Gadobutrol for preoperative evaluation of lower extremity
tumors.
Materials and methods: This prospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. 50
consecutive patients (31 men, 19 women, age range 18–80 years, average age 42.7 years) with lower
extremity tumors underwent TWIST and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Image quality of
TWIST and CTA were evaluated by two radiologists according to a 4-point scale. The degree of arterial stenosis caused by tumor was assessed using TWSIT and CTA separately, and the intra-modality
agreement was determined using a kappa test. The number of feeding arteries identified by TWIST was
compared with that by CTA using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The ability to identify arterio-venous fistulae
(AVF) were compared using a chi-square test.
Results: Image quality of TWIST and CTA were rated as 3.88 ± 0.37 and 3.97 ± 0.16, without statistically
significant difference (P = 0.135). Intra-modality agreement was excellent for the assessment of arterial
stenosis (kappa = 0.806 ± 0.073 for Reader 1, kappa = 0.805 ± 0.073 for Reader 2). Readers identified AVF
with TWIST in 27 of 50 cases, and identified AVF with CTA in 14 of 50 (P < 0.001). Mean feeding arteries
identified with TWIST was significantly more than that with CTA (2.08 ± 1.72 vs 1.62 ± 1.52, P = 0.02).
Conclusion: TWIST is a reliable imaging modality for the assessment of lower extremity tumors. TWIST is
comparable to CTA for the identification of AVF and feeding arteries.

"Abstract: Endometriosis (EMS) is a common disease in women of childbearing age, and pain is the main clinical
symptom. The primary clinical treatments are surgical excision and drug therapy targeting the ectopic lesions, but
these have not been very effective. Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BTX-A) has been reported to be useful in the
treatment of pain in a variety of diseases. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic
effect and mechanism of BTX-A on EMS. We constructed a model of nerve injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells and EMS mice. Model cells and mice were treated with different concentrations of BTX-A to
observe the changes in pain behavior, to detect cell viability and the secretion of Norepinephrine (NE) and methionine enkephalin (M-EK) in cells and the spinal cord, and to evaluate the expression of apoptosis-related molecules
in spinal cord nerves. The results revealed that BTX-A significantly reduced the amount of writhing in model mice,
enhanced the activity of PC12 OGD cells, increased the secretion of NE & M-EK in model cells and the spinal cord
of mice, and decreased the apoptosis of neural cells in the spinal cord of the model mice. Therefore, we believe that
BTX-A may alleviate the pain induced by EMS by increasing the secretion of analgesic substances and promoting
the repair of nerve injury. The present study provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of pain induced by EMS.",0

Background
Dysregulation of lncRNAs is frequent in glioma and has emerged as an important mechanism involved in tumorigenesis. Previous analysis of Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database indicated that LBX2-AS1 expression is one of differentially expression lncRNA between lower grade glioma (LGG) (grade II and III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the function and mechanism of LBX2-AS1 in glioma has not been evaluated yet.

Methods
Here, we analyzed the expression of LBX2-AS1 in GTEx data (normal brain), TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM. RT-PCR was performed to detect LBX2-AS1 in surgery obtained normal brain and glioma. CCK-8 kit and Annexin V-FITC-PI Apoptosis Detection Kit were used to study the function of LBX2-AS1 on glioma proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, western blotting and dual luciferase reporter assay were carried out to investigate the target miRNA of LBX2-AS1. The discovered mechanism was validated by the rescue assay.

Results
Following study of GTEx and TCGA data, LBX2-AS1 was significantly elevated in glioma compared with normal brain and in GBM compared with LGG. Higher expression of LBX2-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with glioma. Expression of LBX2-AS1 was positively correlated with pathology classification of glioma. Knockdown of LBX2-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in glioma. LBX2-AS1 have complimentary binding site for tumor suppressor miR-491-5p and we showed that LBX2-AS1 sponged miR-491-5p to upregulate TRIM28 expression in glioma cells. TRIM28 overexpression attenuated the effect of LBX2-AS1 knockdown on glioma cells.

Conclusions
In conclusion, LBX2-AS1 was an increased lncRNA in glioma. Mechanistically, LBX2-AS1 promoted glioma cell proliferation and resistance to cell apoptosis via sponging miR-491-5p.

We study mentorship in scientific collaborations, where a junior scientist is supported by potentially multiple senior collaborators, without them necessarily having formal supervisory roles. We identify 3 million mentor–protégé pairs and survey a random sample, verifying that their relationship involved some form of mentorship. We find that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by protégés post mentorship without their mentors. We also find that increasing the proportion of female mentors is associated not only with a reduction in post-mentorship impact of female protégés, but also a reduction in the gain of female mentors. While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia, our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career. These findings add a new perspective to the policy debate on how to best elevate the status of women in science.",0
"Abstract
Lymphocyte apoptosis is one reason for immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, although the triggers are unknown. We hypothesized that molecules in plasma, which are up-regulated during sepsis, may be responsible for this. In this study, peripheral lymphocyte apoptosis caused by extracellular histones was confirmed both in mouse and human primary lymphocytes, in which histones induced lymphocyte apoptosis dose-dependently and time-dependently. To identify which intracellular signal pathways were activated, phosphorylation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were evaluated during this process, and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was used to confirm the role of p38 in lymphocyte apoptosis induced by histones. To investigate the mitochondrial injury during these processes, we analyzed Bcl2 degradation and Rhodamine 123 to assess mitochondrial-membrane stability, via cyclosporin A as an inhibitor for mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Then, caspase 3 activation was also checked by western-blotting. We found that p38 phosphorylation, mitochondrial injury and caspase 3 activation occurred dose-dependently in histones-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis. We also observed that p38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased lymphocyte apoptotic ratio by 49% (P<0.05), and inhibition of MPT protected lymphocytes from apoptosis. Furthermore, to investigate whether histones are responsible for lymphocyte apoptosis, various concentrations of histone H4 neutralization antibodies were co-cultured with human primary lymphocytes and plasma from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice or sham mice. The results showed that H4 neutralization antibody dose-dependently blocked lymphocyte apoptosis caused by septic plasma in vitro. These data demonstrate for the first time that extracellular histones, especially H4, play a vital role in lymphocyte apoptosis during sepsis which is dependent on p38 phosphorylation and mitochondrial permeability transition. Neutralizing H4 can inhibit lymphocyte apoptosis, indicating that it could be a potential target in clinical interventions for sepsis associated immunoparalysis.",0
"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Evidence suggests that protein isoaspartate methyltransferase 1 (PCMT1) is highly expressed in brain tissue in the substantia nigra, blue plaque, and paraventricular nucleus. In this study, we investigated the effects of neural stem cell conditioned medium on the PCMT1/MST1 pathway to alleviate damage caused by amyloid β (Aβ)25-35 in SH-SY5Y cells. Results demonstrated that Aβ25-35 significantly decreased cell viability in both a time and dose-dependent manner. Neural stem cell-complete medium (NSC-CPM) or NSC-CDM had an inhibitory effect on toxicity when fibrillation of Aβ25-35 occurred, with a greater effect observed with NSC-CDM. An increase in PCMT1 expression levels was observed in the Aβ25-35 + NSC-CDM group. sh-PCMT1 significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited the protective effects of NSC-CDM through the induction of apoptosis and increased expression of p- MST1. Overexpression of PCMT1 reversed the decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induced by Aβ25-35. In summary, our findings suggest that NSC-CDM corrects the damage of Aβ25-35 to cells by increasing levels of PCMT1, which in turn reduces phosphorylation of MST.",0

Objective Recent years have seen new evidence on the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. We updated a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating dual antiplatelet versus monotherapy for patients with acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

Methods We searched PubMed and identified randomised controlled trials evaluating dual antiplatelet versus monotherapy for acute non-cardioembolic IS or TIA within 3 days of ictus up to May 2018. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI were calculated using random effects models. Clinical endpoints included stroke recurrence, composite vascular events and major bleeding.

Results 18 randomised controlled trials including 15 515 patients were pooled in the meta-analysis. When compared with monotherapy among patients with acute IS or TIA, dual antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of stroke recurrence (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.78; p<0.001) and composite vascular events (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.80; p<0.001). Dual therapy was associated with a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.87; p=0.02) when all trial data were combined. However, when all previous trials before the completion of the POINT trial were analysed, dual antiplatelet versus monotherapy was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding (RR 1.46; 95% CI 0.77 to 2.75; p=0.25).

Conclusions Among patients with acute non-cardioembolic IS or TIA within 3 days of ictus, dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a reduction in stroke recurrence, and composite vascular events, when compared with monotherapy. However, a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding was observed.",0

IMPORTANCE Accelerometers and pedometers are accessible technologies that could have a role
in encouraging physical activity (PA) in line with current recommendations. However, there is no solid
evidence of their association with PA in participants with 1 or more cardiometabolic conditions such
as diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVES To assess the association of accelerometer- and pedometer-based interventions with
increased activity and other improved health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic conditions
and to examine characteristics of the studies that could influence the association of both
interventions in improving PA.
DATA SOURCES Records from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and PsycINFO were searched from
inception until August 2018 with no language restriction.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials or cluster randomized clinical trials evaluating the use
of wearable technology devices such as pedometers and accelerometers as motivating and
monitoring tools for increasing PA were included. After removing duplicates, the searches retrieved
5762 references. Following abstract and title screening of 1439 references and full-text screening of
107 studies, 36 studies met inclusion criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Mean difference in PA was assessed by random-effects metaanalysis. Where the scale was different across studies, the standardized mean difference was used
instead. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I
2 statistic and explored using mixed-effects
metaregression. This study was registered with PROSPERO and followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was objectively measured PA in the
short to medium term (postintervention to 8 months’ follow-up).RESULTS Thirty-six randomized clinical trials (20 using accelerometers and 16 using pedometers)
involving 5208 participants were eligible for review. Meta-analysis involving 32 of these trials (4856
participants) showed medium improvements in PA: accelerometers and pedometers combined vs
comparator showed a small significant increase in PA overall (standardized mean difference, 0.39
[95% CI, 0.28-0.51]; I
2 = 60% [95% CI, 41%-73%]) in studies of short to medium follow-up over a
mean (SD) of 32 (28.6) weeks. Multivariable metaregression showed improved association with PA
for complex interventions that involved face-to-face consultation sessions with facilitators (β = 0.36;

Key Points
Question Is the use of accelerometers
and/or pedometers associated with
increased physical activity in people
with cardiometabolic conditions?
Findings This systematic review and
meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical
trials (4856 participants) found that
accelerometer- and pedometer-based
interventions were associated with
small to medium short-term
improvements in physical activity and
that consultations with health
professionals and pedometers were
associated with improved physical
activity.
Meaning Accelerometer- and
pedometer-based interventions for
people with cardiometabolic conditions
have demonstrated encouraging results,
but levels of physical activity remain
below the targets set by clinical
recommendations.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, complex accelerometer- and pedometer-based
interventions led to significant small to medium improvements in PA levels of people with
cardiometabolic conditions. However, longer-term trials are needed to assess their performance over
time. This study found no evidence that simple self-monitored interventions using either
pedometers or accelerometers are associated with improvements in PA.",0

"Abstract: To overcome texture and flavor challenges in fermented plant-based product development,
the potential of microorganisms is generating great interest in the food industry. This study examines
the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on physicochemical properties of fermented soy, oat, and coconut.
L. rhamnosus was combined with different lactic acid bacteria strains and Bifidobacterium. Acidification,
titratable acidity, and viability of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium were evaluated. Oscillation and
flow tests were performed to characterize rheological properties of fermented samples. Targeted and
untargeted volatile organic compounds in fermented samples were assessed, and sensory evaluation
with a trained panel was conducted. L. rhamnosus reduced fermentation time in soy, oat, and coconut.
L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium grew in all fermented raw materials above 107 CFU/g. No significant
effect on rheological behavior was observed when L. rhamnosus was present in fermented samples.
Acetoin levels increased and acetaldehyde content decreased in the presence of L. rhamnosus in all
three bases. Diacetyl levels increased in fermented oat and coconut samples when L. rhamnosus was
combined with a starter culture containing Streptococcus thermophilus and with another starter culture
containing S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium. In all fermented oat samples, L. rhamnosus
significantly enhanced fermented flavor notes, such as sourness, lemon, and fruity taste, which in
turn led to reduced perception of base-related attributes. In fermented coconut samples, gel firmness
perception was significantly improved with L. rhamnosus. The findings suggest that L. rhamnosus can
improve fermentation time and sensory perception of fermented plant-based products.",0
"Abstract Insects utilize diverse food resources which can affect the evolution of their genomic repertoire, including leading to gene losses in different nutrient pathways. Here, we investigate gene loss in amino acid synthesis pathways, with special attention to hymenopterans and parasitoid wasps. Using comparative genomics, we find that synthesis capability for tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and histidine was lost in holometabolous insects prior to hymenopteran divergence, while valine, leucine, and isoleucine were lost in the common ancestor of Hymenoptera. Subsequently, multiple loss events of lysine synthesis occurred independently in the Parasitoida and Aculeata. Experiments in the parasitoid Cotesia chilonis confirm that it has lost the ability to synthesize eight amino acids. Our findings provide insights into amino acid synthesis evolution, and specifically can be used to inform the design of parasitoid artificial diets for pest control.",0
"Tis study aimed to evaluate whether the augmentation of CaP into the femoral head around the lag screw results in superior
clinical and radiological outcomes of treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures using an intramedullary (IM) implant. Fify-six
consecutive patients with unstable trochanteric fractures who had been surgically treated with IM devices between 2014 and 2016
were prospectively reviewed and randomly divided into two groups based on the use of CaP degradable cements: 28 patients were
assigned to the CaP group, while the other 28 patients were assigned to the control group (no use of CaP). Clinical evaluations and
radiological analyses were conducted during a minimum of 2-year follow-up. No signifcant diferences in the mean visual analogue
scale for the hip pain scores and modifed Harris Hip Scores were found between the CaP group and the controls at postoperative 2
months and 2 years. However, earlier walker ambulation was possible in the CaP group (10 ± 9 days) compared to the control group
(13 ± 12 days) (P = 0.02). In radiological analysis, the CaP group showed signifcantly lower diference between tip-apex distance
measured immediately afer surgery and that measured at one-year follow-up compared to the control group (P = 0.012). No screw
cut-out occurred in the CaP group, while one patient in the control group was reoperated for screw cut-out. Te CaP augmentation
into the femoral head around lag screw can reduce lag screw penetration, prevent screw cut-out beyond the femoral head, and
facilitate early ambulation in elderly patients with unstable trochanteric fractures.",0

Purposes
to study the effect of titanium particles on MLO-Y4 and the effects of osteocytes alterations on osteoblasts.

Methods
cultured MLO-Y4 osteocytes were exposed to different concentrations of titanium (Ti) particles, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, Real-time PCR quantification of mRNA expression of SOST, at the same time with Western Blot detection sclerosteosis protein expression levels.MC3T3-E1 cells culture with MLO-Y4 cells exposed to different concentrations of titanium (Ti) particles in vitro, in order to detection of osteoblast osteogenetic activity.

Results
Our results showed that Ti particles inhibited cell viability of MLO-Y4 osteocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with Ti particles caused apoptosis of MLO-Y4cells.Treatment with Ti particles significantly increased expression of the osteocytic marker SOST/sclerostin. Furthermore, treatment of MLO-Y4 cells with Ti particles produced a dose-dependent decrease in ALP activity and decreased mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells through direct cell-cell contact.

Conclusions
Titanium particles damage osteocytes and inhibit osteoblast differentiation.",0

Objective The relationship between asbestos and prostate cancer (PCa) is not well understood due to small number of cases. This
study aimed to determine the incidence and mortality of PCa among workers or residents exposed to asbestos based on a
systematic review and meta-analysis
Methods All published studies citing the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) or standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of PCa in workers
or residents exposed to asbestos were collected by conducting a search on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of
Science before April 2018. Standardized mortality rate for PCa with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled using a fixed-/
random-effect model in STATA (Version14.0). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018095195.
ResultsA total of 17 independent studies were included for the analysis. The overall pooled SMR of PCa was 1.22, with a 95% CI of
1.13 to 1.32, with no heterogeneity across the studies (I2=18.8%, P=.234). Subgroup analysis shows that exposure to crocidolite,
cement, studies conducted in Europe and Oceania, and long study follow-up (≥25 years) all contribute to significantly higher SMR,
and we found no evidence of publication bias (Begg test P value=.592, Egger test P value=.874).
Conclusions This meta-analysis suggested that exposed to asbestos might be associated with an increased risk of PCa. Highexposure level of asbestos could contribute to significantly higher risk of PCa mortality.

"Abstract
Background/Aims: An increasing body of evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are involved in many different cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-dependent mechanism by which the lncRNA GAS5
contributes to the development of breast cancer. Methods: A total of 68 breast cancer patients
were enrolled, and breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues were collected. The human breast
cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, BT549, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 and human breast
cell line MCF10A were utilized in this study. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to detect expression of
relative factors. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was used to evaluate the relationship between
GAS5 and miR-23a, and a dual luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to assess the
relationship between ATG3 and miR-23a. A subcutaneous xenograft nude mouse model was
generated to examine the role of GAS5 and its regulatory pathway in autophagy. Results:
GAS5 levels were frequently decreased in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and its relatively
low expression was closely related to a larger tumour size, advanced tumour-node-metastasis
(TNM) stage and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer tissues. More importantly, we
found that GAS5 promoted autophagy, with enhanced autophagosome formation after GAS5
overexpression. GAS5 was found to act as a microRNA sponge in a pathway that included miR23a and its target gene ATG3. The GAS5-miR-23a-ATG3 axis significantly regulated autophagy
in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: In summary, we report that the GAS5-miR-23a-ATG3 axis can
be regarded as a key regulator of autophagy pathways in breast cancer; it may constitute a
promising biomarker and therapeutic target in the future.",0
"Background. Despite randomized data demonstrating better overall survival favoring radical nephrectomy, partial
nephrectomy continues to be the treatment of choice for low-stage renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: We utilized the National Cancer Database to identify patients younger than 50 years diagnosed with low-stage renal
cell carcinoma (cT1) treated with radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy (2004–2007). Inverse probability of treatment
weighting adjustment was performed for all preoperative factors to account for confounding factors. Kaplan-Meier curves
and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to compare overall survival of patients in the two treatment
arms. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the interaction of type of surgery and clinical stage on overall survival.
Results: Among the 3009 patients (median age ¼ 44 years [interquartile range (IQR) ¼ 40–47 years]), 2454 patients (81.6%) were
treated with radical nephrectomy and 555 patients (18.4%) with partial nephrectomy. The median follow-up was
108.6 months (IQR ¼ 80.2–124.3 months) during which 297 patients (12.1%) in the radical nephrectomy arm and 58 patients
(10.5%) in the partial nephrectomy arm died. Following inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment, there was no
difference in overall survival between patients treated with partial nephrectomy and radical nephrectomy (hazard ratio ¼
0.83, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.63 to 1.10, P ¼ .196). There were no statistically significant interactions between type of surgery and clinical stage on treatment outcome.
Conclusions: There was no difference in long-term overall survival between radical and partial nephrectomy in young and
healthy patients. This patient cohort may have sufficient renal reserve over their lifetime, and preserving nephrons by partial
nephrectomy may be unnecessary.",0
"Abstract
As a widespread phytoplankton species, the coccolithophore Gephyrocapsaoceanica has a significant impact on the global biogeochemical cycle through calcium carbonate precipitation and photosynthesis. As global change continues, marine phytoplankton will experience alterations in multiple parameters, including temperature, pH, CO2, and nitrogen sources, and the interactive effects of these variables should be examined to understand how marine organisms will respond to global change. Here, we show that the specific growth rate of G. oceanica is reduced by elevated CO2 (1000 μatm) in -grown cells, while it is increased by high CO2 in -grown ones. This difference was related to intracellular metabolic regulation, with decreased cellular particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content in the  and high CO2 condition compared to the low CO2 condition. In contrast, no significant difference was found between the high and low CO2 levels in  cultures (p > 0.05). The temperature increase from 20°C to 25°C increased the PON production rate, and the enhancement was more prominent in  cultures. Enhanced or inhibited particulate inorganic carbon production rate in cells supplied with  relative to  was observed, depending on the temperature and CO2 condition. These results suggest that a greater disruption of the organic carbon pump can be expected in response to the combined effects of increased / ratio, temperature, and CO2 level in the oceans of the future. Additional experiments conducted under nutrient limitation conditions are needed before we can extrapolate our findings to the global oceans.",0
"Abstract
Plants synthesize amino acids by collateral metabolic pathways using primary elements carbon and oxygen from air, hydrogen from water in soil and nitrogen from soil. Following synthesis, amino acids are immediately used for metabolism, transient storage or transported to the phloem. Different families of transporters have been identified for import of amino acids into plant cells. The first identified amino acid transporter, amino acid permease 1 (AAP1) in Arabidopsis belongs to a family of eight members and transports acidic, neutral, and basic amino acids. Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with root nodules bacteria. Following fixation, nitrogen is reduced to amino acids and is exported via different amino acid transporters. However, information is lacking about the structure of these important classes of amino acid transporter proteins in plant. We have amplified AAP from Phaseolus vulgaris, an economically important leguminous plant grown all over the world, and sequenced. The sequence has been characterized in silico and a three-dimensional structure of AAP has been predicted and validated. The information obtained not only enhances the knowledge about the structure of an amino acid permease gene in P. vulgaris, but will also help in designing protein–ligand studies using this protein as well.",0
"Abstract. Objective. An outbreak of pneumonia named COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus in
Wuhan is rapidly spreading worldwide. The objective of the present study was to clarify further the clinical characteristics and blood parameters in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods. Twenty-three
suspected patients and 64 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection were admitted to a
designated hospital. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
Results. Of the 64 patients studied, 47 (73.4%) had been exposed to a confirmed source of COVID-19
transmission. On admission, the most common symptoms were fever (75%) and cough (76.6%). Twentyeight (43.8%) COVID-19 patients showed leukopenia, 10 (15.6%) showed lymphopenia, 47 (73.4%)
and 41 (64.1%) had elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), respectively, and 30 (46.9%) had increased fibrinogen concentration. After the treatment, the
counts of white blood cells and platelets, and the level of prealbumin increased significantly, while aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hsCRP decreased. COVID-19 patients
with the hospital stay longer than 12 days had higher body mass index (BMI) and increased levels of AST,

"Introduction: CD27 is a co-stimulatory immune checkpoint molecule in the tumor necrosis
factor receptor superfamily. CD27 regulates the generation and maintenance of T cell
immunity by binding to CD70 and regulating B-cell activation and immunoglobulin
synthesis.
Materials and Methods: CD27 and CD70 expression were assessed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) compared to normal tissue samples in the GSE53625 dataset of
179 paired cases and in 153 Chinese cases using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. The correlation was also investigated between CD27 and CD70 expression and immune-related pathways, including CD8+
T cell recruitment, function, and other inhibitory immune checkpoints.
Results: Levels of both CD27 and CD70 expression were down-regulated in ESCC compared to the paired normal tissues. CD27 and CD70 expression was mainly present in
lymphocytes surrounding and infiltrating the tumor lesions but rarely expressed in tumor
cells. Lost expression of CD27 and CD70 was associated with clinicopathological features,
including depth of tumor invasion and better patient survival. Furthermore, CD27 expression
was significantly associated with levels of CD8A, GZMB, IFNG, the CD8+ T cell recruitment-associated chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and CD8 receptors (CCR5,
CXCR6, and CXCR3), while CD70 expression was inversely associated with levels of
immunosuppressive checkpoints (PD-L1, PD-L2, and HHLA2).
Conclusion: Detection of CD70/CD27 expression could be further verified as a biomarker
for ESCC early detection and prognosis prediction.

"Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) and liver cancer had similarities in imaging results, clinical
characteristics, and so on. And it is difficult for clinicians to distinguish them before operation. The aim
of our study was to build a differential diagnosis nomogram based on platelet (PLT) score model and
use internal validation to check the model. The predicting model was constructed by the retrospective
database that included in 153 patients with HAE (66 cases) or liver cancer (87 cases), and all cases
was confirmed by clinicopathology and collected from November 2011 to December 2018. Lasso
regression analysis model was used to construct data dimensionality reduction, elements selection,
and building prediction model based on the 9 PLT-based scores. A multi-factor regression analysis was
performed to construct a simplified prediction model, and we added the selected PLT-based scores
and relevant clinicopathologic features into the nomogram. Identification capability, calibration,
and clinical serviceability of the simplified model were evaluated by the Harrell’s concordance index
(C-index), calibration plot, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and decision curve. An internal
validation was also evaluated by the bootstrap resampling. The simplified model, including in 4 selected
factors, was significantly associated with differential diagnosis of HAE and liver cancer. Predictors of
the simplified diagnosis nomogram consisted of the API index, the FIB-4 index, fibro-quotent (FibroQ),
and fibrosis index constructed by King’s College Hospital (King’s score). The model presented a perfect
identification capability, with a high C-index of 0.929 (0.919 through internal validation), and good
calibration. The area under the curve (AUC) values of this simplified prediction nomogram was 0.929,
and the result of ROC indicated that this nomogram had a good predictive value. Decision curve
analysis showed that our differential diagnosis nomogram had clinically identification capability. In
conclusion, the differential diagnosis nomogram could be feasibly performed to verify the preoperative
individualized diagnosis of HAE and liver cancer.",0
"both settings since 2014 to determine whether site of service affected
stent utilization.
Methods: Between 2014 and 2018, there were 739 total angioplasty or
angioplasty with stenting procedures performed by our group; 599
were done in the hospital setting, whereas 140 were performed in an
ambulatory facility, initially as a physician office site of service and since
2018 as an ambulatory surgery center. Patients’ demographics and variables were compared.
Results: There was no difference in any clinical or demographic variable
between the hospital and nonhospital groups, other than a higher incidence of Medicaid patients in the hospital setting (P < .001). In hospital-treated patients, 190 of 599 procedures included adjunctive stenting
(33.2%), whereas in the non-hospital-treated patients, 45 of 140 had stents
(32.1%), despite financial incentives for both professional and facility reimbursement in favor of stenting (P ¼ .94).
Conclusions: Whereas financial incentives have not yet had an appreciable influence in stent utilization within previous reimbursement paradigms, the dramatic changes proposed by CMS may well alter this
dynamic and lead to substantially higher overall costs without proven
clinical advantage. With very high failure and reintervention rates and
increasingly expensive adjuncts (drug-coated balloons and stents,
covered stents), the cost implications of attempts to incentivize interventionalists toward a specific site of care are substantial, and unintended
negative consequences are likely to occur.",0

The present investigation aimed to assess the impact of copper (Cu) stress on the physiological and proteomic behavior of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. E. camaldulensis is likely a potential phytoremediator in areas vulnerable to Cu contamination, such as the industrial areas of Riyadh. To realize this objective, young seedlings of E. camaldulensis were potted in an open area with soil comprised of clay and sand. Different doses of Cu (30, 50, and 100 µM) were applied to the plants as CuSO4·5H2O for 6 weeks. Plant growth was monitored during the Cu exposure period, and morphological and physiological indicators were measured once a week to determine the growth rates. A proteomics study was also conducted to find out the influence of Cu stress on proteins. Our results showed that growth was negatively affected by Cu treatment, particularly at the highest concentrations. Moreover, using a proteomic analysis showed 26 targets involved in protein expression. Elevated levels of Cu increased the expression of 11 proteins and decreased the expression of 15 proteins. Changes were detected in proteins involved in photosynthesis, translation, transcription, metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings provided insights into the molecular mechanisms related to Cu stress, in addition to its influence on the morphological and physiological attributes of E. camaldulensis seedlings. This investigation aimed to characterize the mechanism behind the impact of Cu stress on the plant.

"Abstract
Several reviews have assessed the relationship between exposure to ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes during pregnancy, but the results remain controversial. The objective of this study was to assess this correlation quantitatively and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We included all published case-control or cohort studies that evaluated the correlation between ambient air pollution and low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), and small for gestational age (SGA). Analytical methods and inclusion criteria were provided on the PROSPERO website (CRD42018085816). We evaluated pooled effects and heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses (grouped by exposure period, study settings, study design, exposure types, data source, Newcastle-Ottawa quality score (NOS), and adjustment for smoking or meteorological factors) were also conducted and publication bias was examined. The risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in this review. Forty studies met the inclusion criteria. We observed pooled odds ratios (ORs) of 1.03–1.21 for LBW and 0.97–1.06 for PTB when mothers were exposed to CO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM2.5, PM10, or SO2 throughout their pregnancy. For SGA, the pooled estimate was 1.02 in relation to NO2 concentrations. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis decreased the heterogeneity to some extent, such as the subgroups of continuous measures (OR=0.98 (0.97–0.99), I 2=0.0%) and NOS>7 (OR=0.98 (0.97–0.99), I 2=0.0%) in evaluating the association between PTB and NO2. This review was completed with a low risk of bias. High concentrations of air pollution were significantly related to the higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, the sources of heterogeneity among studies should be further explored.",0
"Abstract
Purpose: Human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) have limited regenerative capacity in vivo. Reduced hCEC density results in bullous keratopathy requiring corneal transplantation. This study reveals the role of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in hCEC diseases and suggests that TCF4 may be a molecular target for hCEC regeneration.

Methods: Cell shape, cell proliferation rates, and proliferation-associated proteins were evaluated in normal or senescent hCECs. TCF4 was blocked by siRNA (si-TCF4) or activated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/dCas9 activation systems (pl-TCF4). The corneal endothelium of six-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was transfected by electroporation followed by cryoinjury.

Results: Cell proliferation rates and TCF4 levels were reduced in senescent cells. TCF4 CRISPR activation enhanced corneal endothelial wound healing. TCF4 regulated mitochondrial functions including mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial superoxide levels, and energy production. The percentage of cells in the S-phase was reduced with si-TCF4 and increased with pl-TCF4. Cell proliferation and cell cycle-associated proteins were regulated by TCF4. Autophagy was induced by si-TCF4. In vivo transfection of CRISPR/dCas9 activation systems (a-TCF4) induced regeneration of corneal endothelium.

Conclusions: Corneal endothelial diseases are associated with TCF4 reduction; TCF4 may be a potential target for hCEC diseases. Gene therapy using TCF4 CRISPR/dCas9 may be an effective treatment for hCEC diseases.",0

Purpose
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)–positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone. Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade. The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.
Methods
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI. Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI. Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety.
Results
Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P = .0064). Consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups. Overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall survival also favored LAP + TRAS + AI. The median PFS with LAP + AI versus TRAS + AI was 8.3 versus 5.7 months (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P = .0361). Common adverse events (AEs; ≥ 15%) with LAP + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, and LAP + AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2. Serious AEs were reported similarly across the three groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP + TRAS + AI.
Conclusion
Dual HER2 blockade with LAP + TRAS + AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS + AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC. This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",0
"ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Early childhood depression is associated with anhedonia and reduced event-related potential (ERP)
responses to rewarding or pleasant stimuli. Whether these neural measures are indicators of target engagement or
treatment outcome is not yet known.
METHODS: We measured ERP responses to win and loss feedback in a guessing task and to pleasant versus neutral
pictures in young (4.0–6.9 years of age) depressed children before and after randomization to either 18 weeks of
Parent-Child Interaction Therapy–Emotion Development (PCIT-ED) or waitlist.
RESULTS: Analyses included reward positivity (RewP) data from 118 children randomly assigned to PCIT-ED (n = 60)
or waitlist (n = 58) at baseline and late positive potential (LPP) data from 99 children (44 assigned to PCIT-ED vs. 55
assigned to waitlist) at baseline. Children undergoing PCIT-ED showed a greater reduction in anhedonia (F1,103 =
10.32, p = .002, partial h2 = .09). RewP reward responses increased more (F1,86 = 5.98, p = .02, partial h2 = .07)
for PCIT-ED, but a greater change in RewP was not significantly associated with a greater reduction in major
depressive disorder symptoms (r = 2.12, p . .4). Baseline RewP did not predict treatment change. LPPs to
positive pictures did not change across treatment, but greater baseline LPPs to positive pictures predicted a
higher likelihood of remission from major depressive disorder in children undergoing PCIT-ED (B = 0.14; SE =
0.07; odds ratio = 1.15; p = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: The ERP reward response improved in young children with depression during a treatment designed to
enhance emotion development, providing evidence of target engagement of the neural systems associated with reward.
Further, greater baseline LPP responses to positive pictures was associated with a greater likelihood of depression
remission, suggesting that this ERP measure can predict which children are most likely to respond to treatment.",0
"Abstract. Occurrence of MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene rearrangements indicates poor prognosis in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients. This is the first study to report the positive rate and distribution characteristics of MLL rearrangements in AML patients in north China. We used multiplex nested real time PCR (RT-PCR) to screen for incidence of 11 MLL
rearrangements in 433 AML patients. Eleven MLL rearrangements included (MLL-PTD, MLL-AF9, MLL-ELL, MLL-AF10,
MLL-AF17, MLL-AF6, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF1Q, MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, MLL-AFX1). There were 68 AML patients with
MLL rearrangements, and the positive rate was 15.7%. MLL-PTD (4.84%) was detected in 21 patients, MLL-AF9 in 15,
(3.46%), MLL-ELL in 10 (2.31%), MLL-AF10 in 8 (1.85%), MLL-AF1Q in 2 (0.46%), 3 cases each of MLL-AF17, MLLAF6, MLL-ENL (0.69% each), a and single case each of MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, and MLL-AFX1 (0.23% each). The highest
rate of MLL rearrangements was found in 24 patients with M5 subtype AML, occurring in 24 cases (35.3%). MLL rearrangements occurred in 21 patients with M2 subtype AML (30.9%), and in 10 patients with M4 subtype AML (14.7%). Screening
fusion genes by multiplex nested RT-PCR is a convenient, fast, economical, and accurate method for diagnosis and predicting
prognosis of AML.",0
"Abstract
Branching morphogenesis of developing organs requires coordinated but poorly understood changes in epithelial cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. We report that Btbd7 is a crucial regulator of branching morphogenesis in vivo. Btbd7 levels are elevated in peripheral cells of branching epithelial end buds, where it enhances cell motility and cell-cell adhesion dynamics. Genetic ablation of Btbd7 in mice disrupts branching morphogenesis of salivary gland, lung and kidney. Btbd7 knockout results in more tightly packed outer bud cells, which display stronger E-cadherin localization, reduced cell motility and decreased dynamics of transient cell separations associated with cleft formation; inner bud cells remain unaffected. Mechanistic analyses using in vitro MDCK cells to mimic outer bud cell behavior establish that Btbd7 promotes loss of E-cadherin from cell-cell adhesions with enhanced migration and transient cell separation. Btbd7 can enhance E-cadherin ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation in MDCK and peripheral bud cells for regulating cell dynamics. These studies show how a specific regulatory molecule, Btbd7, can function at a local region of developing organs to regulate dynamics of cell adhesion and motility during epithelial branching morphogenesis.",0
"Abstract
In the first paper of this series, we showed that the ratio c of individual dose to ambient dose did not change with time in Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The purpose of the present paper, the second in a series, is to estimate the lifetime doses of the Date City residents, based on continuous glass badge monitoring data, extrapolated by means of the ambient-dose-rate reduction function obtained from the airborne monitoring data. As a result, we found that the external exposure contribution to the mean additional lifetime dose of residents living in Date City is not expected to exceed 18 mSv. In addition, effects of decontamination on the reduction of individual doses were not evident. This method of combining individual doses and the ambient doses, as developed in this study, has made it possible to predict with reasonable certainty the lifetime doses of residents who continue to live in this radiologically contaminated area.",0

Abstract
Background: Dental treatments often cause pain and anxiety in patients. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel procedure that can provide distraction during dental procedures or prepare patients to receive such type of treatments. This meta-analysis is the first to gather evidence on the effectiveness of VR on the reduction of pain (P) and dental anxiety (DA) in patients undergoing dental treatment, regardless of age. Methods: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Wiley Library and Web of Science were searched for scientific articles in November 2019. The keywords used were: “virtual reality”, “distraction systems”, “dental anxiety” and “pain”. Studies where VR was used for children and adults as a measure against anxiety and pain during dental treatments were included. VR was defined as a three-dimensional environment that provides patients with a sense of immersion, transporting them to appealing and interactive settings. Anxiety and pain results were assessed during dental treatments where VR was used, and in standard care situations. Results: 31 studies were identified, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Pain levels were evaluated in four studies (n = 4), anxiety levels in three (n = 3) and anxiety and pain together in seven (n = 7). Our meta-analysis was based on ten studies (n = 10). The effect of VR was studied mainly in the pediatric population (for pain SMD = −0.82). In the adult population, only two studies (not significant) were considered. Conclusions: The findings of the meta-analysis show that VR is an effective distraction method to reduce pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a variety of dental treatments; however, further research on VR as a tool to prepare patients for dental treatment is required because of the scarcity of studies in this area.",0

Importance  Anhedonia can present in children and predict detrimental clinical outcomes.

Objective  To map anhedonia in children onto changes in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation and to probe the specificity of these changes in anhedonia against other clinical phenotypes (low mood, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]).

Design, Setting, and Participants  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were from the first annual release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, collected between September 2016 and September 2017 and analyzed between April and September 2018. Cross-sectional data of children aged 9 to 10 years from unreferred, community samples during rest (n = 2455) and during reward anticipation (n = 2566) and working memory (n = 2465) were analyzed.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Alterations in fMRI data during rest, reward anticipation, and working memory were examined, using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Functional MRI connectivity within large-scale networks, between networks, and between networks and subcortical regions were examined during rest. Functional MRI activation were examined during reward anticipation and working memory using the monetary incentive delayed and N-back tasks, respectively.

Results  Among 2455 children with adequate-quality resting-state fMRI data (mean [SD] age, 10.04 [0.62] years; 1187 girls [48.35%]), children with anhedonia (215 [8.76%]), compared with those without anhedonia (2222 [90.51%]), showed hypoconnectivity among various large-scale networks and subcortical regions, including within the arousal-related cingulo-opercular network (mean [SD] with anhedonia, 0.27 [0.08] vs without anhedonia, 0.29 [0.08]; t2,435 = 3.14; P = .002; q[false discovery rate] = 0.07; ln[Bayes factor10] = 2.32). Such hypoconnectivity did not manifest among children with low mood (241 of 2455 [9.82%]), anxiety (93 of 2455 [3.79%]), or ADHD (397 of 2455 [16.17%]), suggesting specificity. Similarly, among 2566 children (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1257 girls [48.99%]) with high-quality task-evoked fMRI data, children with anhedonia (213 of 2566 [8.3%]) demonstrated hypoactivation during reward anticipation in various areas, including the dorsal striatum and areas of the cingulo-opercular network. This hypoactivity was not found among children with low mood (240 of 2566 [9.35%]), anxiety (83 of 2566 [3.23%]), or ADHD (430 of 2566 [16.76%]). Moreover, we also found context- and phenotype-specific double dissociations; while children with anhedonia showed altered activation during reward anticipation (but not working memory), those with ADHD showed altered activation during working memory (but not reward anticipation).

Conclusions and Relevance  Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data set, phenotype-specific alterations were found in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation in children with anhedonia. The hypoconnectivity at rest and hypoactivation during reward anticipation complementarily map anhedonia onto aberrations in neural-cognitive processes: lack of intrinsic arousal connectivity during rest and diminishment of extrinsic reward-arousal activity during reward anticipation. These findings help delineate the pathophysiological underpinnings of anhedonia in children.

"Abstract
Perceptual learning serves as a mechanism for listeners to adapt to novel phonetic information. Distributional tracking theories posit that this adaptation occurs as a result of listeners accumulating talker-specific distributional information about the phonetic category in question (Kleinschmidt & Jaeger, 2015). What is not known is how listeners build these talker-specific distributions; that is, if they aggregate all information received over a certain time period, or if they rely more heavily upon the most recent information received and down-weight older, consolidated information. In the present experiment, listeners were exposed to four interleaved blocks of a lexical decision task and a phonetic categorization task in which the lexical decision blocks were designed to bias perception in opposite directions of a “s”-“sh” contrast. Listeners returned several days later and completed the identical task again. Evidence was consistent with listeners using a relatively short temporal window of integration at the individual session level. Namely, in each individual session, listener’s perception of a “s”-“sh” contrast was biased by the information in the immediately preceding lexical decision block, and there was no evidence that listeners summed their experience with the talker over the entire session. Similarly, the magnitude of the bias effect did not change between sessions, consistent with the idea that talker-specific information remains flexible, even after consolidation. In general, results suggest that listeners are maximally flexible when considering how to categorize speech from a novel talker.",0

Objective

To assess the diagnostic performance of CT fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and to assess whether its use in addition to CT coronary angiography (CTCA) changed the investigation and management of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Method

A retrospective case note review was carried out for 200 consecutive patients at Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, United Kingdom, who had CTCA sent for Heartflow CT-FFR analysis (HeartFlow, Redwood City, CA) between January 2018 and December 2019.

Results

Patients with CT-FFR > 0.8 were significantly less likely to require further investigation with coronary angiography (p: < 0.00001) than those with CT-FFR < 0.8. The use of CT-FFR significantly reduced need for further functional imaging (6% vs 26%) (p: 0.00012). A total of 15 patients in this study had both a CT-FFR and an invasive FFR measured, with seven (46.66%) of the CT-FFRs correlating with the invasive FFR. Approximately 54% of patients who had a CT-FFR < 0.8 were found to have an invasive FFR of >0.8.

Of the 56 patients who underwent coronary angiography, the CT Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) and angiography CAD-RADS were the same in 66% of the cases with 82% of CT CAD-RADS results being within ±1 of the angiography CAD-RADS.

Conclusion

The use of CT-FFR alongside CTCA led to a significant reduction in need for coronary angiography and functional testing. Further studies are required to look at the diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR in direct comparison with invasive FFR.

"ABSTRACT
The non-synovial temporomandibular jaw joint of rorqual whales is presumed to withstand intense stresses when huge volumes of water are engulfed during lunge feeding. Examination and manipulation of temporomandibular joints (TMJs) in fresh carcasses, plus CT scans and field/lab mechanical testing of excised tissue blocks, reveals that the TMJ's fibrocartilage pad fully and quickly rebounds after shrinking by 68–88% in compression (by axis) and stretching 176–230%. It is more extensible along the mediolateral axis and less extensible dorsoventrally, but mostly isotropic, with collagen and elastin fibers running in all directions. The rorqual TMJ pad compresses as gape increases. Its stiffness is hypothesized to damp acceleration, whereas its elasticity is hypothesized to absorb shock during engulfment, allow for rotation or other jaw motion during gape opening/closure, and aid in returning jaws to their closed position during filtration via elastic recoil with conversion of stored potential energy into kinetic energy.",0
"Abstract
There are conflicting results from large randomized controlled trials in different populations regarding the effectiveness of topical application of 4% chlorhexidine to the umbilical stump of newborn infants at reducing neonatal mortality. Meta-analysis and systematic review of trials performed in South Asia and Europe support 4% chlorhexidine application to reduce neonatal mortality, whereas trials performed in Sub-Saharan Africa do not. The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness of 4% chlorhexidine application to the umbilical stump of newborn infants born in lower income countries in order to reduce neonatal mortality when compared with usual cord care.

Our search strategy included randomized trials published between January1st 2000 and September 4th, 2018, that compared 4% chlorhexidine with usual cord care (“dry cord care”). The outcome variable of interest was neonatal mortality. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model were calculated. Nine trials were included, from six countries: Zambia, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Pakistan, with a total of 257,153 participants. Five studies (N = 119,833) reported neonatal mortality. There was a 21% reduction in neonatal mortality among with 4% chlorhexidine application: pooled RR (95% CI) 0.79 (0.69–0.90), P = 0.0005. The incidence of omphalitis was decreased by 35% with 4% chlorhexidine (6 studies, N = 108,263): pooled RR (95% CI) 0.65 (0.56–0.75), P = 0.00001. Chlorhexidine application delayed the umbilical cord separation time (4 studies, N = 28,917): mean difference (95% CI) 2.71 (2.63–2.78) days.

In conclusion, this systematic review found that topical application of 4% chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord stump of newborn infants in lower income countries significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal mortality. Chlorhexidine also reduces the incidence of omphalitis, but prolongs umbilical cord separation time.",0

BACKGROUND 
Serratus anterior plane blocks (SAPBs) and thoracic paravertebral blocks (TPVBs) can both be used for video-assisted thoracic surgery. However, it remains unknown whether the analgesic efficacy of a SAPB is comparable to that of a TPVB.

OBJECTIVE 
We tested the primary hypothesis that SAPBs provide noninferior analgesia compared with TPVBs for video-assisted thoracic surgery.

DESIGN 
A noninferiority randomised trial.

SETTING 
Shanghai Chest Hospital, between August 2018 and November 2018.

PATIENTS 
Ninety patients scheduled for video-assisted thoracic lobectomy or segmentectomy were randomised. Patients were excluded if they were unable to perform the visual analogue pain scale, or surgery was converted to thoracotomy.

INTERVENTIONS 
Blocks were performed after induction of general anaesthesia. The three groups were paravertebral blocks (n = 30); serratus anterior plane blocks (n = 29); and general anaesthesia alone (n = 30).

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES 
Visual analogue pain scores (0 to 10 cm) at rest and while coughing, and Prince-Henry pain scores (0 to 4 points) were used to assess postoperative analgesia at 2, 24 and 48 h after surgery. We assessed the noninferiority of SAPBs with TPVBs on all three primary pain outcomes using a delta of 1 cm or one point as appropriate.

RESULTS 
The mean difference (95% confidence intervals) in visual analogue scores between the SAPBs and TPVBs was −0.04 (−0.10 to 0.03) cm at rest, −0.22 (−0.43 to −0.01) cm during coughing and −0.10 (−0.25 to 0.05) for Prince-Henry pain scores. As the upper limit of the confidence intervals were less than 1 (all P < 0.001), noninferiority was claimed for all three primary outcomes. Compared with general anaesthesia alone, the VAS scores at rest and while coughing, and the Prince-Henry pain scores for the two blocks were significantly lower during the initial 2 h after surgery.

CONCLUSIONS 
Serratus anterior plane blocks are quicker and easier to perform than paravertebral blocks and provide comparable analgesia in patients having video-assisted thoracic surgery. Both blocks provided analgesia that was superior to general anaesthesia alone during the initial 2 h after surgery.

"Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS), which is characterized by high morbidity, disability, and mortality, is recognized as a major cerebrovascular disease. MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) was reported to participate in the progression of brain disease. The present study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of miR-31 on oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury in IS mice with the involvement of protein kinase D1 (PKD1) and the JAK/STAT3 pathway. C57BL/6J mice were used to establish the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Astrocytes were transfected with miR-31 mimic, miR-31 inhibitor, si-PKD1, or JAK-STAT3 pathway inhibitor. Following the establishment of an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model, the astrocytes were cocultured with neuronal OGD. Lower miR-31, higher PKD1 expressions, and activated JAK/STAT3 pathway were found in both the MCAO and OGD models. miR-31 could negatively target PKD1. In an MCAO model, overexpressing miR-31 and silencing PKD1 reduced neuronal injury, cerebral infarct volume, neuron loss, and oxidative stress injury, inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway and the expressions of PKD1, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, malondialdehyde, 4-HNE, 8-HOdG, caspase-3, and Bax, but increased the superoxide dismutase content. In the OGD model, overexpression of miR-31 and silencing of PKD1 attenuated oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury, and diminished the lactate dehydrogenase leakage and reactive oxygen species level, accompanied by elevated neuronal viability. These results indicate that miR-31 alleviates inflammatory response as well as an oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury in IS mice by downregulating PKD1 and JAK/STAT3 pathway.",0

Background
TREM-1 acts as an amplifier of inflammation expressed on macrophages. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TREM-1 and macrophage polarization, and association of TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization with insulin resistance (IR) in obese population compared to non-obese population.

Methods
We enrolled 38 patients after obtaining IRB approval for this study. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of general macrophage marker (CD68), M1 marker (CD86, CCR7, iNOS, IFNγ, TNF-α and IL-6,), M2 marker (CD206, CD163, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokine axis (MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5) along with TREM-1 and TREM-2 in omentum fat, subcutaneous fat, and liver biopsy tissues of non-obese (N = 5), obese non-diabetics, (N = 16) and obese diabetics (N = 17).

Results
The results of our study showed over-expression of TREM-1, M1 markers and down-regulation of TREM-2 and M2 markers in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsies of obese patients (diabetics and non-diabetics) compared to non-obese patients. Overall, the obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers (TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and down-regulation of M2 markers (CD206, CD163 and IL-4) in liver biopsy compared to obese non-diabetics.

Conclusions
TREM-1 expression is significantly increased along with the M1 markers in liver biopsy of obese diabetic (17/17) and obese non-diabetic patients (9/16). Our data suggests that TREM-1 overexpression and M1 macrophage polarization are associated with obesity-induced IR.",0
"Looking back to our recent work that challenged the paradigm of trehalose in stress resistance in yeast,
our objective was to revisit the role of this disaccharide in chronological life span (CLS), and in the control
of apoptosis. Using a catalytically dead variant of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) protein,
(the first enzyme in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway), and by manipulating intracellular trehalose
independently of this pathway, we demonstrated that trehalose has no role in CLS or in the inhibition of
acetic acid or H202-triggered cell death.We showed instead that, in the absence of any apoptotic stimulus,
the Tps1 protein itself was necessary in preventing massive, spontaneous commitment of yeast cells to
apoptosis during growth. Without Tps1p, the life span was shortened and cells were sensitized to acetic
acid (AA) and H202, whereas the overexpression of the inactive variant of Tps1p almost abolished AAtriggered apoptosis. Genetic interaction analysis of TPS1 and genes such as YCA1, NUC1 and AIF1 indicated
thatthese key executioners of cell deathpartially relayed tps1-triggered signaling. Our results suggested
that the pro-survival role of Tps1p could be connected with its ability to preserve ATP levels in yeast cells.",0
"Abstract
Electronic devices have become ubiquitous in daily life, but they emit electromagnetic radiation, which may have negative health impacts at excessive levels. Little is known regarding the impact of radiation emissions on building occupants or strategies for reducing its intensity. This study applied a novel approach using system analysis to quantify radiation exposure in building spaces, examine building material responses to radiation propagation, and investigate risks to human health in the country of Qatar. Radiation intensity levels varied based on the location and type of building space. Different types of construction materials showed varied responses to electromagnetic field wave propagation. Drywall exhibited the best blocking effect, whereas glass and lumber walls exhibited poor blocking effects. The field strengths quantified in this study are less than the corresponding reference values specified by some jurisdictions, but they are still significantly higher than the safety levels defined in many other countries, which could result in significant health risks. The key strategies for improving indoor environmental quality include the use of shielding materials, spatial design, reduction of exposure time, increased exposure distance, and complete avoidance of exposure in sensitive areas.",0
"Abstract
Elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). An active lifestyle is necessary in order to improve lipid HDL-C, including (but not limited to) physical exercise. Research on the association between badminton, an intermittent exercise, and HDL-C is limited. We investigated the impact of aerobic exercise and badminton on HDL-C levels in Taiwanese adults. The sociodemographic data of 7797 participants comprising 3559 men and 4238 women aged between 30 to 70 years were retrieved from the Taiwan Biobank. The participants were grouped into three exercise categories—no exercise, aerobic exercise, and badminton exercise. The HDL-C levels were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The multivariate linear regression models were used to determine the associations between HDL and exercise. Comparing the other two groups to the no-exercise group, the individuals who were engaged in aerobic and badminton exercise were significantly associated with a higher HDL-C (β =1.3154; p <0.0001 and β = 6.5954; p = 0.0027, respectively). Aerobic exercise and badminton were also associated with higher HDL-C levels among carriers of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) rs328 genotypes. Aerobic exercise and regular badminton were associated with higher levels of HDL-C, with the badminton group being more significant.",0
"Abstract
Importance  For-profit (vs nonprofit) dialysis facilities have historically had lower kidney transplantation rates, but it is unknown if the pattern holds for living donor and deceased donor kidney transplantation, varies by facility ownership, or has persisted over time in a nationally representative population.

Objective  To determine the association between dialysis facility ownership and placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant.

Design, Setting, and Participants  Retrospective cohort study that included 1 585 947 patients treated at 6512 US dialysis facilities. Adult patients with incident end-stage kidney disease from the US Renal Data System (2000-2016) were linked with facility ownership (Dialysis Facility Compare) and characteristics (Dialysis Facility Report).

Exposures  The primary exposure was dialysis facility ownership, which was categorized as nonprofit small chains, nonprofit independent facilities, for-profit large chains (>1000 facilities), for-profit small chains (<1000 facilities), and for-profit independent facilities.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Access to kidney transplantation was defined as time from initiation of dialysis to placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant. Cumulative incidence differences and multivariable Cox models assessed the association between dialysis facility ownership and each outcome.

Results  Among 1 585 947 patients, the median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 54-75 years), with 55.8% male, and 28.4% non-Hispanic black patients. Eighty-eight percent of patients received care at a for-profit dialysis facility. A total of 115 650 patients (7.3%) received care at 435 nonprofit small chain facilities; 66 539 (4.2%) at 325 nonprofit independent facilities; 527 458 (33.3%) at 2239 facilities of large for-profit chain 1; 525 997 (33.2%) at 2082 facilities of large for-profit chain 2; 245 633 (15.5%) at 997 for-profit small chain facilities; and 104 670 (6.6%) at 434 for-profit independent facilities. During the study period, 230 202 patients (14.5%) were placed on the deceased donor waiting list, 39 767 (2.5%) received a living donor kidney transplant, and 88 431 (5.6%) received a deceased donor kidney transplant. For-profit facilities had lower 5-year cumulative incidence differences for each outcome vs nonprofit facilities (deceased donor waiting list: −2.6% [95% CI, −2.8% to −2.4%]; receipt of a living donor kidney transplant: −0.9% [95% CI, −1.0% to −0.8%]; and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant: −1.4% [95% CI, −1.5% to −1.3%]). Adjusted Cox analyses showed lower relative rates for each outcome among patients treated at all for-profit vs all nonprofit dialysis facilities: deceased donor waiting list (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.88]); receipt of a living donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.84]); and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.84]).

Conclusions and Relevance  Among US patients with end-stage kidney disease, receiving dialysis at for-profit facilities compared with nonprofit facilities was associated with a lower likelihood of accessing kidney transplantation. Given the possibility of residual confounding, the clinical and policy implications of the results are uncertain.",0
"Abstract
The magnetic fields of linac-MR systems modify the path of contaminant
electrons in photon beams, which alters patient entrance skin dose. Also, the
increased SSD of linac-MR systems reduces the maximum achievable dose
rate. To accurately quantify the changes in entrance skin dose, the authors
use EGSnrc Monte Carlo calculations that incorporate 3D magnetic field
of the Alberta 0.5 T longitudinal linac-MR system. The Varian 600C linac
head geometry assembled on the MRI components is used in the BEAMnrc
simulations for 6 MV and 10 MV beam models and skin doses are calculated
at an average depth of 70 μm using DOSXYZnrc. 3D modeling shows that
magnetic fringe fields decay rapidly and are small at the linac head. SSDs
between 100 and 120 cm result in skin-dose increases of between ~6%–19%
and ~1%–9% for the 6 and 10 MV beams, respectively. For 6 MV, skin dose
increases from ~10.5% to ~1.5% for field-size increases of 5 × 5 cm2
 to
20 × 20 cm2
. For 10 MV, skin dose increases by ~6% for a 5 × 5 cm2
 field,
and decreases by ~1.5% for a 20 × 20 cm2
 field. Furthermore, the proposed
reshaped flattening filter increases the dose rate from the current 355 MU min−1
to 529 MU min−1
 (6 MV) or 604 MU min−1
 (10 MV), while the skin-dose
increases by only an additional ~2.6% (all percent increases in skin dose are
relative to Dmax). This study suggests that there is minimal increase in the
entrance skin dose and minimal/no decrease in the dose rate of the Alberta

Background: 
Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) scores are required for cost-effectiveness and health-care value analysis. We evaluated HRQoL scores and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in patients with advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis treated with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty to establish values of HRQoL scores that can be used for cost-effectiveness and value analysis and to assess relationships between HRQoL scores and shoulder and upper-extremity PROMs.

Methods: 
We analyzed 143 patients (143 shoulders) with glenohumeral osteoarthritis treated with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty; 92 patients had 1-year follow-up. Preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes were assessed with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for shoulder pain and function. Health utility was assessed with the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D), and VAS Quality of Life (VAS QoL). HRQoL score validity was determined through correlations between the PROMs and HRQoL scores. The responsiveness of HRQoL scores was measured through the effect size and the standardized response mean.

Results: 
There were significant improvements in all PROMs and HRQoL scores (p < 0.001) at 1 year after the surgical procedure. The changes in VAS QoL (very weak to moderate), EQ-5D (weak), and SF-6D (weak) were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with the changes in PROMs, demonstrating comparably acceptable validity. There were large effect sizes in the VAS QoL (1.843), EQ-5D (1.186), and SF-6D (1.084) and large standardized response mean values in the VAS QoL (1.622), EQ-5D (1.230), and SF-6D (1.083), demonstrating responsiveness. The effect sizes of all PROMs were larger than those of the HRQoL scores.

Conclusions: 
PROMs and HRQoL scores are not interchangeable, and studies of the cost-effectiveness and value of shoulder arthroplasty should incorporate both shoulder and upper-extremity PROMs and HRQoL scores. The findings of this study provide data on HRQoL scores that are specific to the treatment of advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and can be used for future cost-effectiveness and value analysis studies.",0
"Purpose: To report the incidence of endophthalmitis after senile cataract surgery and to describe the
epidemiology and main risk factors.
Design: Retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional descriptive study.
Participants: Patients who underwent cataract surgery in Farabi Eye Hospital from 2006 through 2014.
Methods: All patients were evaluated retrospectively to compare risk factors, epidemiologic factors, and
prophylaxis methods related to endophthalmitis. Patient records were used to gather the data.
Main Outcome Measures: Epidemiologic factors, systemic diseases, other ocular pathologic characteristics, complications during the surgery, technique of cataract surgery, intraocular lens type, method of antibiotic
prophylaxis, surgeon experience, vitreous culture, and vision outcome were evaluated in these patients.
Results: One hundred twelve endophthalmitis cases among 480 104 operations reported, equaling an
incidence of 0.023%. Patients with diabetes mellitus (14.3%) and of older age (mean age, 81 years), perioperative
communication with the vitreous (17.9%), extracapsular cataract surgery procedure (11%), and surgery on the left
eye (58.9% vs. 41.1% for right eye; P ¼ 0.03) showed a statistically significant association with endophthalmitis.
Short-term treatment with topical or systemic preoperative antibiotics or postoperative subconjunctival injection
was associated with a 40% to 50% reduced odds of endophthalmitis compared with no prophylaxis (P ¼ 0.2). No
cases of endophthalmitis were observed among the 25 920 patients who received intracameral cefuroxime,
suggesting that this approach to antibiotic prophylaxis may be far more effective than traditional topical or
subconjunctival approaches.
Conclusions: The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in our center was 0.023%, comparable
with that of other previously published international studies. Older rural patients with immune suppressive diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, are particularly more prone to endophthalmitis. Vitreous loss at the time of
surgery was associated with a significantly increased risk. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis overall showed a 40%
to 50% reduction in risk, intracameral cefuroxime was 100% effective in preventing endophthalmitis in this
series. Ophthalmology 2016;123:295-301 ª 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",0

Objectives
Since oral betahistine has a very high first-pass effect (ca. 99%), metabolized by monoamine oxidases (MAO), the benefits of a high-dosage betahistine monotherapy were compared with those of a lower dosage of betahistine in combination with the MAO-B inhibitor (MAO-B) selegiline on the frequency of acute attacks of vertigo in patients with Menière’s disease (MD).

Methods
Thirteen adults aged 40–75 years (mean 58.9 years; six females) had initially been treated with a high dosage of betahistine dihydrochloride for at least 1 year. Under this therapy, all of them had ≤ 1 attack for ≥ 3 months prior to the combination pharmacotherapy. Subsequently, they received 5 mg/day selegiline and the dosage of betahistine was reduced to about one tenth and then individually adjusted to the dosage needed to achieve the same treatment response (≤ 1 per 3 months, observational period of at least 6 months).

Results
The initial dosage for the long-term “titration” of the attacks of vertigo was 9–80 24-mg tablets/day (mean 37.3), i.e. 216–1920 mg/day (mean 895.4 mg/day). After the combination with selegiline, the dosage needed to achieve the same benefit for ≥ 3 months was 3–36 24-mg tablets (mean 8.5), i.e., 72–864 mg/day [mean 204.9 mg/day, p < 0.001 (paired t test)]. One patient transiently stopped the treatment with selegiline, another one reduced the dosage to 2.5 mg/day and the attacks re-occurred after 2–4 weeks. Six out of 13 patients reported transient fullness of the head during the combined treatment; in 2 of them this went away when they switched to 2.5 mg bid. In the longer term (> 9 months), one patient had to increase the selegiline dosage to 5 mg bd, one patient stopped the treatment with selegiline.

Conclusions
The achievement of the same clinical effect with a significantly lower (about 1/5) dosage of betahistine can be explained by the inhibition of the MAO-B by selegiline leading to higher serum concentrations of betahistine. This approach is in line with recent developments to bypass the first-pass effect of betahistine by transbuccal or intranasal application. Despite the substantial methodological limitations of such an observational study, this combined pharmacotherapy could be an alternative to a high-dosage monotherapy with betahistine of MD.",0
"Abstract
The complexity of the climate of the past 122;000 years and recent 2000 years was investigated by analyzing the δ 18 O records of ice cores based on the sample entropy (SampEn) method and Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity. In using SampEn method, the climate complexity is measured by the sample entropy, which is a modified approximate entropy defined in terms of the occurring probability of new modes in a record. A larger sample entropy reflects a higher probability to spot a new mode in the data, and in this sense signals a larger complexity of the sample. The δ 18 O record of the past 122,000-year is found to have smaller SampEn than the recent 2000-year. This result suggests that the climate of the past 122;000-year has less complexity than that of the recent 2000 years, even though the record for the former exhibits stronger fluctuations and multifractality than the latter. This diagnosis is additionally supported by calculations of LZ complexity, which has smaller value for the record of the past 122;000 years than the recent 2000 years. Our theoretical findings may further contribute to ongoing explorations into the nonlinear statistical character of the climate change.",0
"Abstract
This double-blind, two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation on fibromyalgia. We were interested in whether rhythmic sensory stimulation would promote significant changes in fibromyalgia and associated symptoms, and whether treatment effects would differ between two distinct treatment parameters. Fifty patients with a formal diagnosis of fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to two test groups. One group received vibrotactile stimulation from a continuous sine wave single-frequency stimulation (40 Hz) for 30 minutes, five days per week, over five weeks, concomitant with usual care. The second group completed the same treatment protocol but received a different stimulation, consisting of random and intermittent complex wave gamma-range vibrotactile stimulation. Fibromyalgia symptoms, pain severity and interference, depression symptoms, quality of life and sleep quality were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results indicated that there were statistically significant changes from baseline to post-treatment in measures of fibromyalgia symptom severity, pain interference, depression, and sleep quality. However, treatment outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. These findings provide preliminary evidence that gamma-frequency rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation may decrease fibromyalgia symptoms and ease associated comorbidities, opening new avenues for further investigation of the effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on chronic pain conditions.",0
"Abstract
When relating genomic data to survival outcomes, there are three main challenges that are the censored survival outcomes, the high-dimensionality of the genomic data, and the non-normality of data. We propose a method to tackle these challenges simultaneously and obtain a robust estimation of detecting significant genes related to survival outcomes based on Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. Specifically, we include a general loss function to the AFT model, adopt model regularization and shrinkage technique, cope with parameters tuning and model selection, and develop an algorithm based on unified Expectation–Maximization approach for easy implementation. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared with existing methods when the data has heavy-tailed errors and correlated covariates. Two real case studies on patients are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method.",0
"Abstract
Background: Prenatal exposure to depression has been considered as a risk factor for adverse childhood, while it is accompanied
by unknown molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated
biological processes between cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers who exposed to major depressive disorder (MDD)
and healthy mothers.
Methods: The microarray data GSE114852 were downloaded to analyze the mRNA expression profiles of umbilical cord blood
with 31 samples exposed to prenatal MDD and 62 samples with healthy mothers. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway and Gene ontology enrichment analyses were conducted to identify associated biochemical pathways and functional
categories of the DEGs. The protein–protein interaction network was constructed and the top 10 hub genes in the network were
predicted.
Results: The results showed several immunity related processes, such as “phagosome”, “Epstein-Barr virus infection”,
“proteasome”, “positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling”, “interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway”, and
“tumor necrosis factor” presented significant differences between two groups. Most of the hub genes (for example PSMD2, PSMD6,
PSMB8, PSMB9) were also associated with immune pathways.
Conclusion: This bioinformatic analysis demonstrated immune-mediated mechanisms might play a fatal role in abnormalities in
fetal gene expression profiles caused by prenatal MDD.

"Abstract
Caffeine’s ergogenic effects persist during various exercise modalities; however, information establishing its efficacy during CrossFit protocols is limited. Our study aimed to determine the effects of caffeine supplementation on CrossFit performance. Thirteen CrossFit-trained men (age = 28.5 ± 6.6 years, experience = 49.2 ± 36.3 months) were randomized in a double-blind, crossover design. Participants completed two sessions separated by a seven-day washout period, 60 min after consuming 5 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo. In each session, participants completed as many rounds as possible in 20 min of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. CrossFit performance was the total number of repetitions completed in 20 min. Paired samples t-tests were used to compare CrossFit performance between caffeine and placebo conditions and to test for a potential learning effect between the first and second sessions. CrossFit performance was significantly higher during the caffeine condition compared to the placebo (461.4 ± 103 vs. 425.0 ± 93.5 repetitions, p < 0.05). No significant learning effect was identified between the first and second sessions (445.6 ± 95.0 vs. 440.8 ± 105.0 repetitions, p = 0.73) nor was there a significant treatment order effect (p = 0.40). Caffeine’s ergogenic effect is present during CrossFit; however, future investigations should establish caffeine’s efficacy during other CrossFit protocols and among female athletes.

"ABSTRACT
Objective: The present study utilized an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior
(TPB) to examine the psychological predictors behind the intention to drink and drive among
female Indian drivers.
Method: Three hundred and forty four female drivers (Mean age ¼ 25.9, SD ¼ 5.6, Age range ¼
18 – 35 years) completed a self-reported questionnaire about the measures related to standard
TPB variables (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention to drink and
drive) along with additional constructs such as alcohol expectancies, risk perception, fatalistic
beliefs, moral norms, past behavior and driver demographics. Pearson correlation matrix was generated to examine bivariate correlations among the various predictors. Hierarchical multiple regression model was developed to examine the influence of psychological predictors on the intention
to drink and drive.
Results: About 25% of the participants reported that they had driven under the influence of alcohol during the previous year. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that standard TPB
variables explained 67.2% of the variance in drink and drive intention. Attitude was found as the
strongest predictor followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. Furthermore,
influence of additional variables such as past behavior and moral norms on intention were found
to be significant. The overall extended TPB model accounted for 71.5% of the variability in the
intention of getting engaged in alcohol-impaired driving.
Conclusion: The study demonstrates the usefulness of TPB model which played a significant role
in predicting the intention to drink and drive along with the utility of additional significant variables. The findings of this study may be useful while designing and implementing policy interventions to reduce risks associated with drinking and driving among female drivers.",0
"Abstract
Reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells into cells resembling beta cells may provide a strategy for treating diabetes. Here we show that transient administration of epidermal growth factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor to adult mice with chronic hyperglycemia efficiently stimulates the conversion of terminally differentiated acinar cells to beta-like cells. Newly generated beta-like cells are epigenetically reprogrammed, functional and glucose-responsive, and reinstate normal glycemic control for up to 248 days. The regenerative process depends on Stat3 signaling and requires a threshold number of Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) expressing acinar cells. In contrast to previous work demonstrating in vivo conversion of acinar cells to beta-like cells by viral delivery of exogenous transcription factors, our approach achieves acinar-to-beta cell reprogramming through transient cytokine exposure rather than genetic modification.

The potential to regenerate severely damaged tissue by converting one differentiated cell type to another is common in lower vertebrates1, but in mammals this conversion capacity is rare and mainly associated with pathological metaplasia2. Thus, the discovery of signaling pathways capable of inducing therapeutic cellular plasticity could open new avenues in regenerative medicine3, 4. Insufficient functional beta cell mass, causes diabetes, a metabolic disorder with clinical complications arising from chronically elevated blood glucose levels. One potential treatment for this disease would be direct conversion of pancreatic non-beta cells into beta cells in sufficient numbers to restore and maintain normoglycemia. The capacity of other adult pancreatic cell types to give rise to new beta cells remains unclear. Genetic lineage tracing in mice demonstrated that under conditions of normal physiology or modest beta cell damage, pre-existing beta cells are solely responsible for generation of new beta cells by self-duplication 5, 6. But with extensive tissue damage by surgical duct ligation, facultative progenitor cells located near the lining of exocrine duct structures are activated to differentiate into new beta cells7. Nevertheless, a duct-related origin of these progenitor cells was contradicted by recent reports using genetic lineage tracing with different duct-specific promoters8–12. Other work showed that following toxin-induced ablation of the near-total beta cell mass alpha cells are reprogrammed to new beta cells13.

The possibility of converting acinar cells to beta cells was suggested in a study in which diabetic mice were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and gastrin14. However, this study lacked evidence by genetic lineage tracing, and subsequent genetic lineage tracing in mice did not support an acinar cell origin of beta cells in several regenerative settings in the injured adult pancreas15. In a notable advance, transduction of mouse acinar cells in vivo with vectors encoding three transcription factors that are necessary for beta cell development induced direct conversion of acinar cells to functional beta-like cells16. Further supporting the notion of lineage plasticity of acinar cells, rodent acinar cells can adopt a duct-like phenotype following suspension culture17–19, dexamethasone treatment can induce their transdifferentiation to a hepatocyte-like cell20 and addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in combination with nicotinamide, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) can stimulate their reprogramming into insulin-positive cells21–24 and own unpublished data. However, the capacity to reprogram acinar cells to beta cells in vivo without genetic manipulation has not been demonstrated.

Given that EGF in combination with either LIF or CNTF can reprogram rat acinar cells into insulin-producing beta-like cells in vitro21–23, we tested the capacity of EGF and CNTF to induce beta cell regeneration in diabetic mice. We show that this therapy regenerates a functional beta cell mass sufficient to normalize hyperglycemia and maintain normoglycemia for at least 248 days. The regenerative process involves reprogramming of acinar cells and depends on activation of the pro-endocrine regulator gene Ngn3 and signaling through STAT3. These results and this experimental model may aid future studies of the potential for using pharmacologic manipulation of signaling pathways as a therapy for diabetes.",0
"Abstract—Calcium- and cAMP-dependent activation of CREB
and transcription of cAMP-responsive element (CRE)–target
genes play critical roles in various physiological and pathological conditions. TORCs (transducers of regulated CREB)
represent a new family of conserved CREB coactivators that
function as intracellular calcium- and cAMP-sensitive coincidence detectors, controlling the kinetics of CRE-mediated
responses and long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Here we examined the expression and activity-dependent translocation of TORCs in adult retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), the primary target of acute retinal ischemic injury as
well as chronic retinal degenerative diseases. We found that
both mRNAs of TORC1 and TORC2, but not TORC3, were
enriched in adult rat retina. Comparing with TORC2, TORC1
protein was highly and selectively expressed in RGCs. At
resting condition, TORC1 protein was localized in the cytoplasm but not nucleus of RGCs. Activation of N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptors by intravitreous injection of
NMDA or increase of cAMP signaling by administration of
forskolin triggered nuclear accumulation of TORC1. Furthermore, transient retinal ischemic injury resulted in peri-nuclear and nuclear accumulation of TORC1 as well as transcription of BDNF in RGCs. Our results demonstrate that
TORC1 is enriched in RGCs and its subcellular location could
be regulated by Ca2_x0001_ and cAMP, suggesting that manipulation of TORC1 activity may promote survival of RGCs in some
optic disease conditions. © 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

Background
Human schistosomiases are acute and chronic infectious diseases of poverty. Currently, epidemiological data of urinary schistosomiasis (US) in school-age children (SAC) and adults are often reported together making it difficult to ascertain the true status of the disease. Based on this premise, we set out to carry out this review.

Method
To achieve this aim, we carried out a computer-aided search of PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, African Journals OnLine (AJOL) and the database of World Health Organization. However, the information obtained from these sources was supplemented with additional literatures from Mendeley, Research Gate, and Google.

Results
The search yielded 183 literatures of which 93 full text research, review and online articles were deemed fit for inclusion. Our key findings showed that: (1) of all World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, Africa is the most endemic zone for US, with Kenya and Senegal recording the highest prevalence and mean intensity respectively; (2) SAC within the range of 5–16 years contribute most significantly to the transmission cycle of US globally; (3) gender is a factor to watch out for, with male often recording the highest prevalence and intensity of infection; (4) contact with open, potentially infested water sources contribute significantly to transmission; (5) parental factors (occupation and education status) predispose SAC to US; (6) economic vis a vis ecological factors play a key role in infection transmission; and (7) in the last decade, a treatment coverage of 45% was never achieved globally for SAC or non-SAC treatment category for urinary schistosomiasis.

Conclusion
In view of the WHO strategic plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2020 and the findings from this review, it is obvious that this goal, in the face of realities, might not be achieved. It is imperative that annual control programmes be scaled up marginally, particularly in the African region of WHO. While US-based researches should be sponsored at the grass-root level to unveil hidden endemic foci, adequate facilities for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) should be put in place in all schools globally.

"Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with a very dismal prognosis, and current therapeutic
options still retain an overall unsatisfactorily efficacy in clinical practice. Therefore, novel therapeutic
approaches and effective medications are highly needed. Since the development of new drugs
is an extremely long, complex and expensive process, researchers and clinicians are increasingly
considering drug repositioning/repurposing as a valid alternative to the standard research process.
Drug repurposing is also under active investigation in GBM therapy, since a wide range of noncancer
and cancer therapeutics have been proposed or investigated in clinical trials. Among these, a
remarkable role is played by the antipsychotic drugs, thanks to some still partially unexplored,
interesting features of these agents. Indeed, antipsychotic drugs have been described to interfere
at variable incisiveness with most hallmarks of cancer. In this review, we analyze the effects of
antipsychotics in oncology and how these drugs can interfere with the hallmarks of cancer in GBM.
Overall, according to available evidence, mostly at the preclinical level, it is possible to speculate that
repurposing of antipsychotics in GBM therapy might contribute to providing potentially effective
and inexpensive therapies for patients with this disease.",0
"Objectives: Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. Attenuated disease severity was considered in patients with Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene variations. Corticosteroids are highly effective in controlling the symptoms but usually cause more frequent episodes. Frequent fever episodes either initiated after the steroid therapy or as an initial disease characteristics are the most challenging feature.

Methods: Sixty-seven patients were prospectively followed from September 2015 to January 2018. MEFV variants were searched in all patients. Colchicine therapy was initiated in patients with MEFV variants and with shortened intervals after the initiation of steroid therapy.

Results: Heterozygous MEFV gene variants were detected in 23 patients (34.3%). Higher exon 10 allel frequencies were found in patients with frequent fever episodes. Among 26 patients with increased episodes, colchicine treatment decreased the number of the episodes in 8 of 10 (80%) and 4 of 16 (25%) patients with and without variants, respectively (p = 0.022). Fever duration decreased (3.26 ± 1.38 vs. 1.57 ± 0.57 days, p < 0.001) at the third month of therapy in variant(+) patients.

Conclusion: In variant positive patients colchicine prophylaxis reduced the duration of attacks at the third months of therapy. Shortened intervals due to steroid therapy were increased at the sixth months of colchicine therapy.",0
"Purpose: To conduct a meta-analysis with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in full text to
demonstrate database to show the associations of perioperative, postoperative outcomes of arthroscopic
reduction and percutaneous fixation(ARPF) and open reduction and internal fixation(ORIF) for tibial
plateau fractures to provide the predictive diagnosis for clinic.
Methods: Literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for
information from the earliest date of data collection to June 2017. RCTs comparing the benefits and risks
of ARPF with those of ORIF in tibial plateau fractures were included. Statistical heterogeneity was
quantitatively evaluated by X2 test with the significance set P < 0.10 or I
2 > 50%.
Results: Seven RCTs consisting of 571 patients were included.(288 ARPF patients; 283 ORIF patients;).
Pooled results showed that ORIF was related to a greater increase in operative time, incision length,
hospital stay, perioperative complications, and full weight bearing compared with ARPF. The results
showed that ARPF was related to a greater increase in ROM Rasmussen Scores compared with ORIF
(WMD = 10.38; 95% CI, 8.31, 12.45; P < 0.10).
Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that arthroscopic reduction and percutaneous fixation for tibial
plateau fractures, compared with open reduction and internal fixation, could demonstrate an decreased
risk of perioperative and postoperative complications and improve clinical outcome in operative time,
incision length, hospital stay, perioperative complications, full weight bearing and Rasmussen Scores.",0

[cognitively normal controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD], with the lowest
testosterone levels in men with AD. Lower baseline testosterone levels were associated
with higher baseline clinical severity. Change in testosterone levels between baseline and
1-year follow-up varied by diagnosis; MCI had the greatest decreases in testosterone
levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Despite differences by clinical diagnosis,
there was no association between plasma testosterone and CSF biomarkers of AD
pathology. We also tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AR for association
with AD risk in a separate cohort from ADNI and found 26 SNPs associated with risk
for AD. The top associated SNP is predicted to be an expression quantitative trait locus
for AR in multiple tissues, including brain, with the AD-associated risk allele predicted to
confer lower AR expression. Our findings suggest a link between the androgen pathway
and AD through Aβ/tau independent pathways. These effects may be most pronounced
during conversion from MCI to dementia.",0
" Abstract
Background: The aetiology of angio-oedema (AE) is difficult to determine; however, it is essential in emergency situations when two major contexts may be present: mast cellmediated AE and bradykinin-mediated AE. Different forms
of AE are currently distinguished based on clinical criteria
(spontaneous duration of the attack, presence of concomitant or late-appearing superficial urticaria, history of atopy,
and others), but specific biomarkers could improve patient
management. Objective: In this prospective study, potential biomarkers have been identified, and their statistical
characteristics were examined. Methods: Samples were
taken on day 0 (D0) and D7 for 3 patient groups (n = 11
each): bradykinin-mediated AE [peripheral site of attack,
ear, nose, throat (ENT), and abdominal involvement], mast cell-mediated AE, and non-bradykinin-mediated abdominal pain. Results: Assay of the potential biomarkers revealed no significant differences in C1 inhibitor and C4 levels. In contrast, D-dimer levels peaked during bradykininmediated AE attacks (median 2.2 mg/l at D0 vs. 0.52 mg/l at
D7; p < 10 –3 ) as well as during mast cell-mediated AE attacks
(1.97 vs. 0.65 mg/l; p = 0.04) and were high in bradykininmediated AE compared to the control group (0.69 mg/l; p =
0.01). A threshold value of 0.62 mg/l was found to have a
negative predictive value of 100% for bradykinin-mediated
AE compared to other causes of abdominal pain (group 3).
Circulating VE-cadherin levels were also increased during
an attack (1,990 at D0 vs. 1,566 ng/ml at D7; p = 0.01), but
could not distinguish between bradykinin-mediated and
mast cell-mediated AE, like D-dimers. Conclusions: Exploration of changes in fibrinolysis-related markers (particularly
D-dimers) is thus promising for the diagnosis of AE attacks
in difficult-to-diagnose abdominal forms, although it was
not able to differentiate between bradykinin and mast cellmediated AE. ",0
"Abstract
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reverse transcriptase whose essential RNA subunit (TER) functions as a template for telomere repeat synthesis. Here we report the identification of two divergent TER moieties in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Although both TER1 and TER2 copurify with telomerase activity and serve as templates for telomerase in vitro, depletion of TER1, but not TER2, leads to decreased telomerase activity and progressive telomere shortening in vivo. Moreover, mutation of the templating domain in TER1 results in the incorporation of mutant telomere repeats on chromosome ends. Thus, TER1 provides the major template for telomerase in vivo. We also show that POT1a binds TER1 with a Kd of 2 × 10-7 M and the two components assemble into an enzymatically active RNP in vivo. In contrast, TER1-POT1b and TER2-POT1a associations were not observed. In other organisms POT1 proteins bind telomeric DNA and provide chromosome end protection. We propose that duplication of TER and POT1 in Arabidopsis fueled the evolution of novel protein–nucleic acid interactions and the migration of POT1 from the telomere to the telomerase RNP.

"Abstract
We previously showed that the small molecule 1,3,5-trihydroxy-13,13-dimethyl-2H-pyran [7,6-b] xanthone (TDP) induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by suppressing Hsp27 expression, although the mechanism is not fully understood. To investigate the functional association between TDP and Hsp27 protein in HCC, recombinant Hsp27 protein was incubated with TDP at room temperature, and assayed by mass spectrum (MS) and natural electrophoresis. TDP effectively stimulated Hsp27 to form aggregates ex vitro, leading to suppression of its chaperone activity. The aggregates were degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome (UPS) pathway. TDP directly interacted with Asp17 and Phe55 in chain C of Hsp27 on the basis of bioinformatic prediction. In conclusion, Hsp27 is a direct target of TDP in its anti-cancer activity, which provides strong support for a clinical application.",0

Background
The angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril–valsartan led to a reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The effect of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibition in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is unclear.
Methods
We randomly assigned 4822 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, ejection fraction of 45% or higher, elevated level of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease to receive sacubitril–valsartan (target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily). The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes. Primary outcome components, secondary outcomes (including NYHA class change, worsening renal function, and change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] clinical summary score [scale, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and physical limitations]), and safety were also assessed.
Results
There were 894 primary events in 526 patients in the sacubitril–valsartan group and 1009 primary events in 557 patients in the valsartan group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.01; P=0.06). The incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was 8.5% in the sacubitril–valsartan group and 8.9% in the valsartan group (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16); there were 690 and 797 total hospitalizations for heart failure, respectively (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.00). NYHA class improved in 15.0% of the patients in the sacubitril–valsartan group and in 12.6% of those in the valsartan group (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86); renal function worsened in 1.4% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.77). The mean change in the KCCQ clinical summary score at 8 months was 1.0 point (95% CI, 0.0 to 2.1) higher in the sacubitril–valsartan group. Patients in the sacubitril–valsartan group had a higher incidence of hypotension and angioedema and a lower incidence of hyperkalemia. Among 12 prespecified subgroups, there was suggestion of heterogeneity with possible benefit with sacubitril–valsartan in patients with lower ejection fraction and in women.
Conclusions
Sacubitril–valsartan did not result in a significantly lower rate of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 45% or higher.

"Abstract
The reproduced tactile sensation of haptic interfaces usually selectively reproduces a certain object attribute, such as the
object’s material reflected by vibration and its surface shape by a pneumatic nozzle array. Tactile biomechanics investigates
the relation between responses to an external load stimulus and tactile perception and guides the design of haptic interface
devices via a tactile mechanism. Focusing on the pneumatic haptic interface, we established a fluid–structure interactionbased biomechanical model of responses to static and dynamic loads and conducted numerical simulation and
experiments. This model provides a theoretical basis for designing haptic interfaces and reproducing tactile textures.",0
"Abstract
Reinforcement from engaging in health behaviors is often delayed by several months or years, a circumstance partly responsible for some people’s increased preference for engaging in unhealthy behaviors associated with immediate reinforcement. To examine whether individuals who discount the future engage in fewer health behaviors, 72 young adults completed questionnaires assessing health behaviors and impulsiveness and laboratory-behavioral measures of impulsive decision making. Regression analyses of impulsivity measures predicting health behavior were only significant for one measure, the Experiential Discounting Task, a task in which monetary consequences of choice were actually experienced by study participants. Participants who discounted most by delay (i.e., exhibited impulsive choice) engaged in fewer health behaviors than those who showed less impulsive responding. This task, in contrast to a hypothetical choice task or self-reported impulsiveness, measures the actual behavior of discounting by delay, and was the facet of impulsive decision making most closely associated with adopting a range of health behaviors.",0
"Abstract
Research has found that the appearance of women’s apparel helps increase their attractiveness as rated by men and that men care more about physical features in potential opposite-sex mates. However, the effect of sartorial appearance has received little interest from scientists. In a series of studies, the length of women’s shoe heels was examined. A woman confederate wearing black shoes with 0, 5, or 9 cm heels asked men for help in various circumstances. In Study 1, she asked men to respond to a short survey on gender equality. In Study 2, the confederate asked men and women to participate in a survey on local food habit consumption. In Study 3, men and women in the street were observed while walking in back of the female confederate who dropped a glove apparently unaware of her loss. It was found that men’s helping behavior increased as soon as heel length increased. However, heel length had no effect on women’s helping behavior. It was also found that men spontaneously approached women more quickly when they wore high-heeled shoes (Study 4). Change in gait, foot-size judgment, and misattribution of sexiness and sexual intent were used as possible explanations.",0

Objective: 
This systematic review was designed to evaluate the overall efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided implantation versus angiography-guided for percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods: 
The following electronic databases, such as CENTRAL, PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews to investigate OCT-guided and angiography-guided implantation. We measured the following 7 parameters in each patient: stent thrombosis, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), all-cause death.

Results: 
In all, 11 studies (6 RCTs and 5 observational studies) involving 4026 subjects were included, with 1903 receiving intravascular ultrasound-guided drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation and 2123 using angiography-guided DES implantation. With regard to MACE, MT, TLR, TVR, stent thrombosis and all-cause death, the group of OCT-guided implantation had no significant statistical association with remarkably improved clinical outcomes. However, its effect on cardiovascular death has a significant statistical difference in angiography-guided implantation group.

Conclusion: 
In the present pool analysis, OCT-guided DES implantation showed a tendency toward improved clinical outcomes compared to angiography-guided implantation. More eligible randomized clinical trials are warranted to verify the findings and to determine the beneficial effect of OCT-guidance for patients.",0

Background
The autistic spectrum is characterized by profound impairments of social interaction. The exact subpersonal processes, however, that underlie the observable lack of social reciprocity are still a matter of substantial controversy. Recently, it has been suggested that the autistic spectrum might be characterized by alterations of the brain’s inference about the causes of socially relevant sensory signals.
Methods
We used a novel reward-based learning task that required integration of nonsocial and social cues in conjunction with computational modeling. Thirty-six healthy subjects were selected based on their score on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and AQ scores were assessed for correlations with cue-related model parameters and task scores.
Results
Individual differences in AQ scores were significantly correlated with participants’ total task scores, with high AQ scorers performing more poorly in the task (r = −.39, 95% confidence interval = −0.68 to −0.13). Computational modeling of the behavioral data unmasked a learning deficit in high AQ scorers, namely, the failure to integrate social context to adapt one’s belief precision—the precision afforded to prior beliefs about changing states in the world—particularly in relation to the nonsocial cue.
Conclusions
More pronounced autistic traits in a group of healthy control subjects were related to lower scores associated with misintegration of the social cue. Computational modeling further demonstrated that these trait-related performance differences are not explained by an inability to process the social stimuli and their causes, but rather by the extent to which participants consider social information to infer the nonsocial cue.",0

Background
Total elbow arthroplasty is a low volume procedure. We aimed to evaluate complication rates and cumulative percentages associated with the most frequently used contemporary implants and for the commonest indications.
Methods
A systematic literature search of all studies reporting complications following total elbow arthroplasty with 12-month minimum follow-up was undertaken. Quality of studies was assessed with the Methodological-Index-for-Non-Randomised-studies criteria. British NJR data identified the most common UK prostheses and indications. The complication rates for all undesirable events contributing to patient outcome were extracted and cumulative percentages were calculated.
Results
One hundred seventeen studies were screened, 12 studies included, totalling 815 procedures. Mean follow-up was 3.8 years. The overall complication cumulative percentage was 60.7%, significantly higher than that seen in other joint arthroplasty, including a 6.5% deep infection rate. Nerve injury was comparable between implants at around 4.1%. Radiographic loosening had a cumulative rate of 17.2%. Revision for symptomatic aseptic loosening was 6.3%.
Conclusions
This is the largest systematic review of the complications of total elbow arthroplasty. Surgeons should be aware of differing complications related to their implant of choice, each having its own specific complication. Trauma as an indication appears to have an increased complication rates compared to inflammatory arthropathy. There is a lack of literature regarding the independent results of osteoarthritis as a specific indication for total elbow arthroplasty.",0
"Background. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease and a regular
epidemic in Thailand. The peak of the dengue epidemic period is around June to
August during the rainy season. It is believed that climate is an important factor for
dengue transmission.
Method. A mathematical model for vector–host infectious disease was used to
calculate the impacts of climate to the transmission of dengue virus. In this study,
the data of climate and dengue fever cases were derived from Chiang Mai during
2004–2014, Thailand. The value of seasonal reproduction number was calculated to
evaluate the potential, severity and persistence of dengue infection.
Results. The mosquito population was increasing exponentially from the start of
the rainy season in early May and reached its the peak in late June. The simulations
suggest that the greatest potential for the dengue transmission occurs when the temperature is 28.9 ◦C. The seasonal reproduction numbers were larger than one from
late March to end of August and reaching the peak in June. The highest incidences
occurred in August due to the delay of transmission humans-mosquito-humans.
Increasing mean temperature by 1 ◦C, the number of incidences increases 28.1%.
However, a very high or very low temperature reduces the number of infection.
Discussion and Conclusion. The results show that the dengue infection depends on
the seasonal variation of the climate. The rainfall provides places for the mosquitoes
to lay eggs and develop to the adult stage. The temperature plays an important role
in the life cycle and behavior of the mosquitoes. A very high or very low temperature
reduces the risk of the dengue infection.",0

Background
The outcome of chemotherapy in breast cancer is strongly influenced by multidrug resistance (MDR). Several surrogate markers of chemoresistance have been identified including - CD24 (cluster differentiation 24) expression, stem cell growth factor (SCF), B-cell lymphocyte protein 2 (Bcl-2) and annexin V. The present study aimed to examine the expression of CD24 in the sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Michigan Foudation-7) and MCF-7/adriamycin resistant (MCF-7/AdrRes) cells, and, if minimal effective doses of the anthracycline drug adriamycin (0.579 μM and 88.2 μM) would be enhanced by the antibody to SCF (anti-SCF).

Methods
CD24 expression was analysed by flow cytometry. Both Bcl-2 and annexin V protein expression were quantitatively assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Results
In MCF-7/AdrRes cells the expression of CD24 was significantly higher compared to MCF-7 cells, 86.6% and 16.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. Bcl-2 expression was significantly increased in the presence of adriamycin and SCF (p < 0.038) and decreased in the presence of adriamycin and anti-SCF. When adriamycin, anti-SCF and SCF were combined or when adriamycin was used alone the decrease in Bcl-2 expression was insignificantly altered. In the presence of both adriamycin and SCF the expression of annexin V was decreased. However, it was significantly increased in the presence of adriamycin and anti-SCF (p < 0.042), as well as adriamycin, anti-SCF and SCF combined.

In MCF-7 cells the effect of adriamycin alone or with either SCF, anti-SCF or anti-SCF or SCF combined, did not significantly alter the expression of Bcl-2. However, in the presence of both adriamycin and SCF the expression of annexin V was decreased, but was significantly increased in the presence of adriamycin and anti-SCF (p < 0.001), adriamycin, anti-SCF and SCF combined and adriamycin alone. Our results demonstrate that anti-SCF with low dose of adriamycin reduces Bcl-2 expression in MCF-7/AdrRes cells and increases annexin V expression in both MCF7/AdrRes and MCF-7 cells.

Conclusion
Adding anti-SCF to the chemotherapeutic regime of adriamycin may strongly enhance its chemotherapeutic effect in the treatment of patients with breast cancer.",0

Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a devastating pathological feature of numerous ocular diseases and is
a major cause of blindness. In this study, we examined the effect and potential mechanism of interleukin26 (IL-26) in the pathogenesis of RNV in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model. OIR model was
induced by exposure of hypoxia (75% oxygen) to C57BL/6J mice from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P12 and then
returned to room air. A significant up-regulation of IL-26 was detected in the retina at P17 after OIR, and
the expression of IL-26 was observed to be localized mainly in the retinal endothelial cells (RECs).
Furthermore, recombinant (r) IL-26 could effectively prevented RNV by reduction the areas of RNV, and
IL-26 deficiency markedly increased RNV formation. In addition, the increased expressions of nuclear
factor of activated T-cell (NFATc) 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the retina at P17 after
OIR were increased in IL-26 _x0001_/_x0001_ mice, and were down-regulated following rIL-26 treatment. Collectively,
these data suggested a possibility that IL-26 suppressed RNV via NFATc1-VEGF pathway",0
"Abstract
Rodent studies often must be conducted during an animal's active phase (that is, in darkness) yet also during a typical day shift for staff. Low-pressure sodium lighting (LPSL), to which human retinas are more sensitive than rodents’ at low intensity, has been used to facilitate study conduct in dark phase. The assumption was that LPSL would be equivalent to total darkness due to low rodent retinal sensitivity but provide enough lighting for safe technical manipulations due to higher human retinal sensitivity. Unlike other light sources, LPSL has been tested for effects on circadian rhythm specific to locomotive activities in albino mice. Whether LPSL affects circadian rhythms in rats is unknown. In this study, circadian endpoints were derived from body temperature and locomotor activity via telemeters in 8 adult male Wistar rats. When moved from a 12:12-h white-light (that is, cold white fluorescent light):dark (LD) cycle to a 12:12-h white-light:sodium-light cycle, rats demonstrated free-running and disrupted circadian rhythms (that is, lengthened circadian period and reduced circadian robustness and amplitude). Body temperature and locomotor activity were significantly lower in the LPSL phase as compared with dark phase under the baseline condition. When exposed to a 12:12 h sodium-light:dark (SD) cycle, rats entrained with a circadian period similar to 12:12-h white-light:dark (LD), but significantly different from the period under constant darkness (DD). Circadian onset and acrophase were delayed under SD compared with LD. When illuminated with a LPSL pulse under DD, rats showed phase shifts similar to white-light pulse effects, consistent with the phase response curve. To determine whether the image-forming photoreceptors are involved in this process, we used electroretinography. Compared with white light, 589-nm light generated during electroretinography elicited rod photoreceptors responses with longer latency and cone photoreceptor responses with lower amplitude. These results indicate that LPSL is a weaker zeitgeber than white light and may alter the circadian system in rats. Furthermore, because LPSL appeared to be visible to rats, it may not be an appropriate substitute for actual darkness.",0

Background. In Cameroon, both Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS/AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are used as first-line treatment against uncomplicated malaria in line with the WHO recommendations. We compared the efficacy and safety of both therapeutic combinations and determined the prevalence of drug resistance conferring mutations in three parasite genes. Methods. One hundred and fifty acute malaria patients between six months and 14 years of age were randomized to receive standard doses of either AS/AQ (73) or AL (77) and followedup for 28 days. Outcome of treatment was according to the standard WHO classification. DNA samples from pretreatment parasite isolates were used to determine the prevalence of resistant mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and dhfr genes. Results. Both drug combinations induced rapid clearance of parasites and malaria symptoms. PCR-corrected cure rates were 100% and 96.4% for AL. The combinations were well tolerated. Major haplotypes included CVIET (71%), CVMNT (25%) for the pfcrt; SND (100%) for the pfmdr1; IRN (79, 8%), NCS (8.8%), and mixed haplotype (11, 8%) for the dhfr. Conclusion. Both AS/AQ and AL were highly effective and well tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Ngaoundere, Cameroon. High prevalence of mutant pfcrt alleles confirms earlier observations. Long-term monitoring of safety and efficacy and molecular markers is highly solicited.",0

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are innovative and informative blood-based biomarkers involved in numerous pathophysiological processes. In this study and based on our previous experimental data, we investigated miR-126, miR-143, miR-145, miR-155 and miR-223 as potential circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary objective of this study was to assess the levels of miRNA expression at various stages of CKD.

Methods
RNA was extracted from serum, and RT-qPCR was performed for the five miRNAs and cel-miR-39 (internal control).

Results
Serum levels of miR-143, -145 and -223 were elevated in patients with CKD compared with healthy controls. They were further increased in chronic haemodialysis patients, but were below control levels in renal transplant recipients. In contrast, circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-155 levels, which were also elevated in CKD patients, were lower in the haemodialysis group and even lower in the transplant group. Four of the five miRNA species were correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, and three were correlated with circulating uraemic toxins.

Conclusions
This exploratory study suggests that specific miRNAs could be biomarkers for complications of CKD, justifying further studies to link changes of miRNA levels with outcomes in CKD patients.",0

Background
Pregnancy is a period of transition, which makes women more vulnerable and in unfavorable conditions may lead to psychopathology in both mother and infant. It is essential to outline factors adversely affecting the resolution of this period. Early interventions and why they matter: Interventions during pregnancy can provide important improvement in the outcome for both maternal and infant mental health.

Aim
The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk factors of antenatal anxiety and depression focusing particularly on maternal representations of the relationship towards the fetus and her own parents during pregnancy and the early postpartum period.

Methods
The study is outlined using a quantifiable interview during pregnancy to evaluate the woman’s ability to keep her child in mind, measured by reflective functioning. Reflective functioning provides information regarding the pregnant woman’s relationship quality to her fetus and important people in her life. Primiparae in Stockholm around gestation week 20 are asked about their experience with respect to pregnancy, their relationship to their family, partner, and their unborn child. The women selected to the study are an at risk population, with high levels of stress, childhood adversity, and/or history of mental health. These women are more vulnerable to develop perinatal anxiety and depression.

Results
The pregnancy interview provides valuable insight into the pregnant women’s psychic constitution. The quantifiable measure of their mental state, reflective functioning, serves as measure of quality of the mother’s parenting capacity. The countertransference and transference of the interviewer towards the women during the interview enables a more profound understanding of the underlying dynamics and constructs of repression, aggression, mourning, and narcissistic defenses.

Conclusion
A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the pregnant women’s intrapsychic reorganization of motherhood and her relation to the unborn child shall facilitate specific early interventions. These interventions shall be targeted to specific risk groups and enable the prevention of adverse child outcomes.

Objective. To compare the amounts of anchorage loss in the upper first molar (U6) and of retraction of the upper central incisor (U1) in cases with Class I malocclusion between orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) and conventional anchorage reinforcements (CARs). Methods. The subjects were 40 female adult patients with Class I malocclusion who were treated with extraction of the first premolars and sliding mechanics. The subjects were divided into Groups 1 (N = 20, CAR) and 2 (N = 20, OMI) according to anchorage method. Lateral cephalograms were taken before (T0) and after treatment (T1). Seven skeletal and dental variables and ten anchorage variables were measured. Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis. Results. Group 2 showed significantly larger retraction of U1 (U1E-sag, 9.5 mm : 7.1 mm, P < .05) and less anchorage loss of U6 (U6M-sag, 0.2 mm : 2.2 mm, P < .05; U6A-sag, 0.3 mm versus 2.4 mm, P < .01) than Group 1. There was opposite vertical movement in U1 and U6 between Groups 1 and 2 (U1E-ver, 0.9 mm intrusion : 0.7 mm extrusion; U6F-ver, 1.0 mm intrusion : 0.9 mm extrusion, P < .05). Conclusion. Although OMI could not reduce the treatment duration, it could provide better maximum anchorage of U6, greater retraction of U1, intrusion of U1 and U6 than CAR.",0
"Abstract
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of non-coding RNAs that are widely expressed in mammals. However, it is largely unknown about the function of human circRNAs and the roles of circRNAs in human oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Here we performed a comprehensive study of circRNAs in human OSCC using circRNA and mRNA microarrays, and identified many circRNAs that are differentially expressed between OSCC tissue and paired non-cancerous matched tissue. We further found a circRNA termed circRNA_100290 that served as a critical regulator in OSCC development. We discovered that circRNA_100290 was upregulated and co-expressed with CDK6 in OSCC tissue. Knockdown of circRNA_100290 decreased expression of CDK6 and inhibited proliferation of OSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Via luciferase reporter assays, circRNA_100290 was observed to directly bind to miR-29 family members. Further EGFP/RFP reporter assays showed that CDK6 was the direct target of miR-29b. Taken together, we conclude that circRNA_100290 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate CDK6 expression through sponging up miR-29b family members. Taken together, it indicates that circRNAs may exert regulatory functions in OSCC and may be a potential target for OSCC therapy.",0

Background
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is caused by blood clotting in the deep veins. Thrombosis resolution and recanalization can be accelerated by endothelial progenitor cells. In this report, we investigated the effects of miR-126-loaded EPC-derived exosomes (miR-126-Exo) on EPCs function and venous thrombus resolution.

Methods
In vitro promotional effect of miR-126-Exo on the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs was investigated via transwell assay and tube formation assay. In addition, a mouse venous thrombosis model was constructed and treated with miR-126-Exo to clarify the therapeutic effect of miR-126-Exo by histological analysis. Lastly, this study predicted a target gene of miR-126 using target prediction algorithms and confirmed it by luciferase activity assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot.

Results
Transwell assay and tube formation assay indicated that miR-126-Exo could enhance the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs. Moreover, in vivo study manifested enhanced thrombus organization and recanalization after miR-126-Exo treatment. Meanwhile, we identified that Protocadherin 7 as a target gene of miR-126.

Conclusions
To sum up, our results demonstrated that EPC-derived exosomes loaded with miR-126 significantly promoted thrombus resolution in an animal model of venous thrombosis, indicating exosomes as a promising potential vehicle carrying therapeutic molecules for DVT therapy.",0

• The sHLA peptidomes are highly correlated with the tumor’s membranal HLA peptidomes.
• The HLA peptidomes differ significantly from the proteomes of the tumors.",0
"Abstract
Translocation of ions and other molecules across the plasma membrane of yeast requires the electric potential generated by a H+-ATPase. We measured under different conditions fluorescence changes and accumulation of acridine yellow, looking for qualitative and quantitative estimations of the PMP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in various conditions. Fluorescence changes indicated an accumulation of the dye requiring a substrate, and accumulation and quenching by mitochondria that could be released by an uncoupler. K+ produced a decrease of the fluorescence that was much lower upon the addition of Na+. These changes were confirmed by images of the cells under the microscope. The dye accumulation under different conditions showed changes consistent with the physiological situation of the cells. Since it accumulates due to the PMP, but a large part of it binds to the internal components, we permeabilized the cells with chitosan to subtract this factor and correct the accumulation data. Both raw and corrected values of PMP are different to those obtained before by other authors and our group, showing acridine yellow as a promising indicator to follow changes of the PMP by the fluorescence changes, but also by its accumulation. Under conditions described, the dye is a low cost monitor to define and follow qualitative and quantitative changes of PMP in yeast. Acridine yellow can also be used to follow changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential.",0

Bax, despite being a cytosolic protein, has the distinct ability to form channels in the
mitochondrial outer membrane capable of releasing proteins that initiate the execution phase
of apoptosis. When studied in a planar phospholipid membrane system full-length activated
Bax can form conducting entities consistent with linearly organized three-channel units
displaying steep voltage-gating (n=14) that rivals that of channels in excitable membranes. In
addition the channels display strong positive cooperativity possibly arising from the charge
distribution of the voltage sensors. Based on the functional behavior, one of the channels in
this functional triplet is oriented in the opposite direction to the others often resulting in
conflicts between the effects of the electric field and the positive cooperativity of adjacent
channels. The closure of the first channel occurs at positive potentials and this permits the
second to close but at negative potentials. The closure of the second channel in turn permits
closure of the third but at positive potentials. Positive cooperativity manifests itself in a
number of ways including the second and the third channels opening virtually
simultaneously. This extraordinary behavior must have important although as yet undefined
physiological roles.",0

Background: 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-articular methylprednisolone for reducing pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Methods: 
We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.11), PubMed (1966-2017.11), Embase (1980-2017.11), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.11), and the Cochrane Library (1900-2017.11) for randomized clinical trials comparing the use of methylprednisolone to treat knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores and WOMAC function scores. Each outcome was combined and calculated using the statistical software STATA 12.0. Fixed/random effect model was adopted based on the heterogeneity tested by I2 statistic.

Results: 
A total of 739 patients were analyzed across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the WOMAC pain scores at 4 weeks (WMD = −1.384, 95% CI: −1.975 to −0.793, P = .000), 12 weeks (WMD = −1.587, 95% CI: −2.489 to −0.685, P = .001), and 24 weeks (WMD = −1.563, 95% CI: −2.245 to −0.881, P = .000). Significant differences were identified in terms of physical function at 4 weeks (WMD = −7.925, 95% CI: −13.359 to −2.491, P = .004), 12 weeks (WMD = −7.314, 95% CI: −13.308 to −1.320, P = .117), and 24 weeks (WMD = −6.484, 95% CI: −11.256 to −1.711, P = .008).

Conclusion: 
Intra-articular methylprednisolone injection was associated with an improved pain relief and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, no severe adverse effects were observed. Due to the limited quality of the evidence currently available, higher quality RCTs were required.",0

Background
Daysy is a fertility monitor that uses the fertility awareness method by tracking and analyzing the individual menstrual cycle. In addition, Daysy can be connected to the application DaysyView to transfer stored personal data from Daysy to a smartphone or tablet (IOS, Android). This combination is interesting because as it is shown in various studies, the use of apps is increasing patients´ focus on their disease or their health behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate if by the additional use of an App and thereby improved usability of the medical device, it is possible to enhance the typical-use related as well as the method-related pregnancy rates.

Result
In the resultant group of 125 women (2076 cycles in total), 2 women indicated that they had been unintentionally pregnant during the use of the device, giving a typical-use related Pearl-Index of 1.3. Counting only the pregnancies which occurred as a result of unprotected intercourse during the infertile (green) phase, we found 1 pregnancy, giving a method-related Pearl-Index of 0.6. Calculating the pregnancy rate resulting from continuous use and unprotected intercourse exclusively on green days, gives a perfect-use Pearl-Index of 0.8.

Conclusion
It seems that combining a specific biosensor-embedded device (Daysy), which gives the method a very high repeatable accuracy, and a mobile application (DaysyView) which leads to higher user engagement, results in higher overall usability of the method.",0

Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a frequent developmental disorder characterized by pervasive deficits in social interaction, impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication, and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children.

Methods
This study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was conducted on 109 children with ASD (85 boys and 24 girls; aged 3–10 years). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the core symptoms of autism in children. ASD patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 or placebo for 4 months. The serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH)D) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. The autism severity and social maturity of the children were assessed by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). Trial registration number: UMIN-CTR Study Design: trial number: UMIN000020281.

Results
Supplementation of vitamin D was well tolerated by the ASD children. The daily doses used in the therapy group was 300 IU vitamin D3/kg/day, not to exceed 5,000 IU/day. The autism symptoms of the children improved significantly, following 4-month vitamin D3 supplementation, but not in the placebo group. This study demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of high doses of vitamin D3 in children with ASD.

Conclusions
This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients, and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies are needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD.",0
"Abstract
The surface characteristics of fractured specimens are important in hydraulic fracturing laboratory experiments. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) scanning device assembled to study these surface characteristics. Cube-shaped rock specimens were produced in the laboratory and subjected to triaxial loading until the specimen split in two in a hydraulic fracturing experiment. Each fractured specimen was placed on a rotating platform and scanned to produce 3D superficial coordinates of the surface of the fractured specimen. The scanned data were processed to produce high-precision digital images of the fractured model, a surface contour map and accurate values of the superficial area and specimen volume. The images produced by processing the 3D scanner data provided detailed information on the morphology of the fractured surface and mechanism of fracture propagation. High-precision 3D mapping of the fractured surfaces is essential for quantitative analysis of fractured specimens. The 3D scanning technology presented here is an important tool for the study of fracture characteristics in hydraulic fracturing experiments.

"Abstract
Background: Reports associate marijuana use with cardiovascular emergencies. Studies relating marijuana use to
cardiovascular mortality are scarce. Recent advance towards marijuana use legalization emphasizes the importance of
understanding relationships between marijuana use and cardiovascular deaths; the primary ranked mortality.
Recreational marijuana is primarily smoked; we hypothesize that like cigarette smoking, marijuana use will be associated
with increased cardiovascular mortalities.
Design: The design of this study was based on a mortality follow-up.
Method: We linked participants aged 20 years and above, who responded to questions on marijuana use during the
2005 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to data from the 2011 public-use linked mortality file of the
National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only participants eligible for mortality follow-up were included. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to estimate hazard ratios
for hypertension, heart disease, and cerebrovascular mortality due to marijuana use. We controlled for cigarette smoking
and other relevant variables.
Results: Of the 1213 eligible participants 72.5% were presumed to be alive. The total follow-up time was 19,569 personyears. Adjusted hazard ratios for death from hypertension among marijuana users compared to non-marijuana users was
3.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.20–9.79) and for each year of marijuana use was 1.04 (95% confidence interval:
1.00–1.07).
Conclusion: From our results, marijuana use may increase the risk for hypertension mortality. Increased duration of
marijuana use is associated with increased risk of death from hypertension. Recreational marijuana use potentially has
cardiovascular adverse effects which needs further investigation.",0

Background
Mindfulness-based therapies are being used in a wide range of common chronic conditions
in both treatment and prevention despite lack of consensus about their effectiveness in different patient categories.
Objective
To systematically review the evidence of effectiveness MBSR and MBCT in different
patient categories.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis of systematic reviews of RCTs, using the standardized MBSR or MBCT programs. We used PRISMA guidelines to assess the quality of the included reviews and performed a random effects meta-analysis with main outcome measure
Cohen’s d. All types of participants were considered.
Results
The search produced 187 reviews: 23 were included, covering 115 unique RCTs and 8,683
unique individuals with various conditions. Compared to wait list control and compared to
treatment as usual, MBSR and MBCT significantly improved depressive symptoms
(d=0.37; 95%CI 0.28 to 0.45, based on 5 reviews, N=2814), anxiety (d=0.49; 95%CI 0.37 to 0.61, based on 4 reviews, N=2525), stress (d=0.51; 95%CI 0.36 to 0.67, based on 2 reviews, N=1570), quality of life (d=0.39; 95%CI 0.08 to 0.70, based on 2 reviews, N=511)
and physical functioning (d=0.27; 95%CI 0.12 to 0.42, based on 3 reviews, N=1015). Limitations include heterogeneity within patient categories, risk of publication bias and limited
long-term follow-up in several studies.
Conclusion
The evidence supports the use of MBSR and MBCT to alleviate symptoms, both mental and
physical, in the adjunct treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, depression, anxiety disorders and in prevention in healthy adults and children.",0
"Abstract
The archaeological sites near Monte Alegre, along Brazil’s lower Amazon River, provide
new information on the little-known activities and symbolism of South American Paleoindians toward the end of the Ice Age. While paleoindian sites like Monte Verde in Chile, or
Guitarrero Cave in Peru, are located near the pacific coast, Monte Alegre lies much further
inland, 680 km upriver from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Atlantic Coast. With
excavated wood charcoal radiocarbon dated as early as 13,200 calibrated years ago, the
hill—as a source of sandstone and quartz lithics—supplied early pioneers with adequate
tools needed for colonizing the interior of the continent. Once there, they painted rock art on
the landscape, which bears a record of the sun’s horizon positions throughout the year. At
just 2˚ south of the equator, Monte Alegre shows no overt seasonal changes beyond fluctuating rainfall amounts, unlike at higher latitudes where temperature, amount of daylight,
foliage, and forms of precipitation markedly change. Near the equator, solar and stellar horizon sightings most visibly track the passage of time and seasonal cycles. However, horizons
are often hidden behind high forest canopy throughout much of the Amazon Rainforest; but
in the Monte Alegre hill ridges looming above the river, paleoindians could hike above the
canopy to peer at the horizon, more effectively synchronizing their activities to ecological
cycles. This research suggests that Monte Alegre paleoindians delimited the azimuthal
range of the sun in a solar year with notational pictographs aligned to horizon sightings at
Painel do Pilão, and leaving a painted grid of tally marks that might have served as a rudimentary early calendar. The broad-reaching implication for early Americans is that through
the strategic placement of rock art, these ancient artists fostered predictive archaeorecording from which resources could be optimally extracted, ceremonial activities could be consistently scheduled, and gatherings for social and economic exchange could be more
efficiently coordinated.",0
"Abstract
The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms and protective effect of serum‑free‑medium‑type fetal placental mesenchymal stem cell (fPMSC) culture supernatant on A549 lung epithelial cells following treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A549 lung epithelial cells were stimulated with different concentrations of H2O2, and the survival rate of the cells was examined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay. It was concluded that the H2O2 concentration when the cell survival rate was at 50% was the optimum condition to create an oxidative damage model. Hoechst 33258 staining and western blot analysis was used to validate the A549 lung epithelial cell model. Serum‑free medium was used to culture fPMSCs, and A549 lung epithelial cells treated with H2O2 were cultured with passage 3 MSC supernatant for 24 h. This was termed the supernatant group. Simultaneously, a damage group that was stimulated with H2O2 only, and a vitamin C (VC) group that was treated with H2O2 followed by 100 µmol/l VC in culture medium was also established. The apoptosis of the three groups was detected by flow cytometry, and western blotting was used to detect apoptosis‑associated and nuclear factor erythroid 2‑like 2 (Nrf2)‑kelch‑like ECH‑associated protein 1 (Keap1)‑antioxidant response element/oxidative stress‑associated protein expression. Following the CCK‑8 test, 600 µmol/l H2O2 was selected to stimulate the A549 lung epithelial cells for 24 h, which resulted in a A549 cell survival rate of 56.41±3.31%. Hoechst 33258 staining and western blotting also confirmed the reliability of the model. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the apoptotic rate of the cells in the VC and supernatant groups was reduced compared with that in the injury group. The difference between the supernatant group and the injury group was statistically significant. The detection of apoptosis‑associated proteins by western blotting revealed that the expression of apoptosis regulator BAX and Caspase‑3 in the VC and supernatant groups was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of B‑cell lymphoma‑2 was increased compared with that in the injury group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with that in the injury group, the expression of Nrf2 increased in the VC and supernatant groups, whereas the expression of Keap1 was decreased, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In conclusion, fPMSC supernatant exhibited an antioxidant capacity in A549 lung epithelial cells treated with H2O2 as a model of acute lung injury. The supernatant was found to reduce oxidative damage and inhibit apoptosis.",0
"Abstract
Importance  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is associated with a strong and severity-dependent increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Whether antireflux surgery prevents esophageal adenocarcinoma is a matter of uncertainty.

Objectives  To examine whether antireflux surgery is associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and whether the risk is different between surgically and medically treated patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants  In this multinational, population-based retrospective cohort study from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, patients undergoing surgery were followed up for a median of 12.7 years, and a comparison group of patients receiving medication only were followed up for a median of 4.8 years. All patients with a registered diagnosis of GERD (or an associated disorder), including 48 414 individuals undergoing surgery and 894 492 receiving medication only, were included in the study. The study periods varied in the different countries depending on the year of initiation of registration and the date of data retrieval, from January 1, 1964, to December 21, 2014.

Exposures  Antireflux surgery for GERD.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma over time after surgery was compared with that in a corresponding background population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% CIs and with patients with GERD who received medication using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, providing hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs adjusted for confounders.

Results  In this study of 942 906 patients with GERD, 48 414 underwent antireflux surgery (median [interquartile range] age, 66.0 [58.0-73.0] years; 27 161 male [56.1%]) and 894 492 received medication only (median [interquartile range] age, 71.0 [62.0-78.0] years; 434 035 male [48.6%]). Among patients undergoing surgery, 177 developed esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophageal adenocarcinoma risk decreased in a time-dependent manner after surgery compared with the background population (5 to <10 years after surgery: SIR, 7.63; 95% CI, 5.42-10.43; ≥15 years after surgery: SIR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.98-1.80). Among patients with more severe and objectively determined GERD, the SIRs were 10.08 (95% CI, 6.98-14.09) at 5 to less than 10 years after surgery and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.15-2.35) at 15 years or more after surgery. The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma did not change over time in surgical patients compared with patients who received medication only (5 to <10 years after surgery: HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.44-2.84; ≥15 years: HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.28-2.54). The risk remained stable over time in analyses restricted to severe reflux disease (5 to <10 years after surgery: HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.24-2.63; ≥15 years after surgery: HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.14-2.51).

Conclusions and Relevance  Medical and surgical treatment of GERD were associated with a similar reduced esophageal adenocarcinoma risk, with the risk decreasing to the same level as that in the background population over time, supporting the hypothesis that effective treatment of GERD might prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma.",0
"ABSTRACT
In situ imaging of mRNA in living cells can help to monitor the real time mRNA expression and also useful for
diagnosis and prognosis of the diseases. In this study, a new strategy was designed for simple, sensitive, and
selective platform to detect the mRNA levels by combining a hairpin probe-graphene oxide (HP1/GO) and
duplex-specific nuclease signal amplification (DSNSA). Initially, the DNA probe was adsorbed on the surface of
GO to protect it from enzymatic digestion. Then, the target mRNA (T1) was hybridized with a partial hairpin
probe which formed a duplex. Finally, under the action of DSN nuclease, the ssDNA in the DNA/RNA hybrid was
selectively cleaved and produced small fragments. Then, T1 triggered the next reaction cycle, constituting a new
circular exponential amplification. Here, we conclude that this assay is highly sensitive for the detection of target
mRNA with the lower detection limit of 1 fM under optimal conditions. Furthermore, this strategy was successfully used for imaging of mRNA in living cells.",0
"Abstract
Background: There is a global epidemic of overweight and obesity; however, this rate of
increase is even greater in some low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). South Africa
(SA) is undergoing rapid socioeconomic and demographic changes that have triggered a
rapid nutrition transition. The paper focuses on the recent rate of change of body mass
index (BMI) among children, adolescents and young adults, further stratified by key sociodemographic factors.
Methods: We analysed mean BMI of 28 247 individuals (including children) from 7301
households by age and year, from anthropometric data from four national crosssectional (repeated panel) surveys using non-linear fitted curves and associated 95%
confidence intervals.
Results: From 2008 to 2015, there was rapid rise in mean BMI in the 6–25 age band, with
the highest risk (3–4þ BMI unit increase) among children aged 8–10 years. The increase
was largely among females in urban areas and of middle-high socioeconomic standing.
Prominent gains were also observed in certain rural areas, with extensive geographical
heterogeneity across the country.
Conclusions: We have demonstrated a major deviation from the current understanding
of patterns of BMI increase, with a rate of increase substantially greater in the developing
world context compared with the global pattern. This population-wide effect will have
major consequences for national development as the epidemic of related noncommunicable disease unfolds, and will overtax the national health care budget. Our
refined understanding highlights that risks are further compounded for certain groups/

"Abstract
A growing number of studies have examined associations between night shift work and the risks of common cancers among women, with varying conclusions. We did a meta-analysis to identify whether long-term night shift work increased the risks of common cancers in women. We enrolled 61 articles involving 114,628 cases and 3,909,152 participants from Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. Risk estimates were performed with a random-effect model or a fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses about breast cancer were conducted to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. In addition, we carried out a dose–response analysis to quantitatively estimate the accumulative effect of night shift work on the risk of breast cancer. A positive relationship was revealed between long-term night shift work and the risks of breast [OR = 1.316; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.196–1.448], digestive system (OR = 1.177; 95% CI, 1.065–1.301), and skin cancer (OR = 1.408; 95% CI, 1.024–1.934). For every 5 years of night shift work, the risk of breast cancer in women was increased by 3.3% (OR = 1.033; 95% CI, 1.012–1.056). Concerning the group of nurses, long-term night shift work presented potential carcinogenic effect in breast cancer (OR = 1.577; 95% CI, 1.235–2.014), digestive system cancer (OR = 1.350; 95% CI, 1.030–1.770), and lung cancer (OR = 1.280; 95% CI, 1.070–1.531). This systematic review confirmed the positive association between night shift work and the risks of several common cancers in women. We identified that cancer risk of women increased with accumulating years of night shift work, which might help establish and implement effective measures to protect female night shifters.

"Abstract
Loxoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the 2-arylpropionic acid type, which has used to treat musculoskeletal disorders in the horse racing industry. However, it has also used illicitly to mask clinical signs of inflammation and pain in racehorses. Thus, its accurate analysis has become an important issue in horse doping laboratories. In this study, an analytical method of loxoprofen was developed as tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivative by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Characteristic fragment ions of [M-15], [M-57], and [M-139] permitted the accurate and selective detection of loxoprofen. Under optimal conditions, this method showed good linearity (r ≥ 0.999) in the range of 10–500 ng/mL, repeatability (% relative standard deviation = 5.6–8.5), and accuracy (% relative error = − 0.3–0.9) with a detection limit of 1.0 ng. When applied to the analysis of loxoprofen in tablet and patch products, loxoprofen was positively identified as TBDMS derivative by GC–MS. The present method provided rapid and accurate determination of loxoprofen in patch and tablet products. Levels of loxoprofen were highest in equine urine at 0.5 and 1 h after oral administration with single dose (3 mg/kg) to three horses, and then rapidly reduced to below the lower limit of quantification at 24 h. Therefore, the present method will be useful for the pharmacokinetic study and doping tests for loxoprofen and other similar acidic drugs in horses.",0

Aims
The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is a pharmacotherapeutic target for drug dependence. We have successfully imaged human D3Rs using radiolabeled LS-3-134, an arylamide phenylpiperazine with moderate selectivity for the D3R over D2R and low efficacy at the D2 and D3R. In this study, we screened for effects of LS-3-134 as a potential anti-cocaine therapeutic.
Methods
Male rats were pretreated with LS-3-134 (0, 1.0, 3.2, or 5.6 mg/kg, IP) 15 min prior to tests for its effects on spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion. We next investigated the effects of LS-3-134 (0, 1.0, 3.2, 5.6, or 10.0 mg/kg, IP) on operant responding on a multiple variable-interval (VI) 60-second schedule with alternating cocaine (0.375 mg/kg, IV) and sucrose (45 mg) reinforcer components. Additionally, we tested LS-3-134 (5.6 mg/kg, IP) effects on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of cocaine reinforcement, on extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior, and on reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior by cocaine-associated light/tone cues.
Results
LS-3-134 did not alter spontaneous locomotion, but reduced cocaine-induced locomotion, break points on the high-effort progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, and responding during extinction and cue reinstatement. In contrast, LS-3-134 did not alter cocaine or sucrose reinforcement on the low-effort multiple VI 60-second schedule.
Conclusions
The effects of LS-3-134 are similar to other dopamine D3 low efficacy partial agonists and antagonists in attenuating cocaine intake under high effort schedules of reinforcement and in attenuating cocaine-seeking behavior elicited by cocaine-associated cues. These findings are consistent with the anti-craving profile of other dopamine D3 drugs.",0
"Antibodies targeting citrullinated proteins (ACPAs [anticitrullinated protein antibodies]) are commonly found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), strongly associate with distinct HLA-DR alleles, and predict a more aggressive disease course as compared with seronegative patients. Still, many features of these antibodies, including their site of production and the extent of MHC class II–driven T cell help, remain unclarified. To address these questions, we have used a single B cell–based cloning technology to isolate and express immunoglobulin (Ig) genes from joint-derived B cells of active RA patients. We found ∼25% of synovial IgG-expressing B cells to be specific for citrullinated autoantigens in the investigated ACPA+ RA patients, whereas such antibodies were not found in ACPA− patients. The citrulline-reactive monoclonal antibodies did not react with the unmodified arginine peptides, yet several reacted with more than one citrullinated antigen. A role for active antigen selection of the citrulline-reactive synovial B cells was supported by the strong bias toward amino acid replacement mutations in ACPA+ antibodies and by their loss of reactivity to citrullinated autoantigens when somatic mutations were reverted to the corresponding germline sequences.",0
"Abstract
We examined the psychological impact of visual darkness on people’s perceived risk of contagious-disease transmission.
We posited that darkness triggers an abstract construal level and increases perceived social distance from others,
rendering threats from others to seem less relevant to the self. We found that participants staying in a dimly lit
room (Studies 1 and 3–5) or wearing sunglasses (Study 2) tended to estimate a lower risk of catching contagious
diseases from others than did those staying in a brightly lit room or wearing clear glasses. The effect persisted in both
laboratory (Studies 1–4) and real-life settings (Study 5). The effect arises because visual darkness elevates perceived
social distance from the contagion (Study 3) and is attenuated among abstract (vs. concrete) thinkers (Study 4). These
findings delineate a systematic, unconscious influence of visual darkness—a subtle yet pervasive situational factor—on
perceived risk of contagion. Theoretical contributions and policy implications are discussed.",0

Background
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully implemented in cattle research and breeding. However, moving from the associations to identifying the causal variants and revealing underlying mechanisms have proven complicated. In dairy cattle populations, we face a challenge due to long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) arising from close familial relationships in the studied individuals. Long range LD makes it difficult to distinguish if one or multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) are segregating in a genomic region showing association with a phenotype. We had two objectives in this study: 1) to distinguish between multiple QTL segregating in a genomic region, and 2) use of external information to prioritize candidate genes for a QTL along with the candidate variant.

Results
We observed fixing the lead SNP as a covariate can help to distinguish additional close association signal(s). Thereafter, using the mammalian phenotype database, we successfully found candidate genes, in concordance with previous studies, demonstrating the power of this strategy. Secondly, we used variant annotation information to search for causative variants in our candidate genes. The variant information successfully identified known causal mutations and showed the potential to pinpoint the causative mutation(s) which are located in coding regions.

Conclusions
Our approach can distinguish multiple QTL segregating on the same chromosome in a single analysis without manual input. Moreover, utilizing information from the mammalian phenotype database and variant effect predictor as post-GWAS analysis could benefit in candidate genes and causative mutations finding in cattle. Our study not only identified additional candidate genes for milk traits, but also can serve as a routine method for GWAS in dairy cattle.

"Abstract
Objective. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory autoimmune disease. Vitamin D has potent immunomodulatory properties that support its use in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, including SLE. We assessed vitamin D status in patients with SLE and determined alterations in inflammatory and hemostatic markers and disease activity before and after vitamin D supplementation.

Methods. Patients with SLE (n = 267) were randomized 2:1 to receive either oral cholecalciferol 2000 IU/day or placebo for 12 months. Outcome measures included assessment of alterations in levels of proinflammatory cytokines and hemostatic markers, and improvement in disease activity before and after 12 months of supplementation. Disease activity was measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index. Vitamin D levels were measured by Liaison immunoassay (normal 30–100 ng/ml). Serum levels between 10 and 30 ng/ml were classified as vitamin D insufficiency and levels < 10 ng/ml as vitamin D deficiency.

Results. The mean 25(OH)D level at baseline was 19.8 ng/ml in patients compared to 28.7 ng/ml in controls. The overall prevalence of suboptimal and deficient 25(OH)D serum levels among patients with SLE at baseline was 69% and 39%, respectively. Lower 25(OH)D levels correlated significantly with higher SLE disease activity. At 12 months of therapy, there was a significant improvement in levels of inflammatory and hemostatic markers as well as disease activity in the treatment group compared to the placebo group.

Conclusion. Vitamin D supplementation in patients with SLE is recommended because increased vitamin D levels seem to ameliorate inflammatory and hemostatic markers and show a tendency toward subsequent clinical improvement. Clinical Trial Registry NCT01425775.",0
"Abstract—It has not been fully examined whether angiotensin II receptor blocker is superior to calcium channel blocker to
reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance. A prospective, open-labeled, randomized,
controlled trial was conducted for Japanese hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance.
A total of 1150 patients (women: 34%; mean age: 63 years; diabetes mellitus: 82%) were randomly assigned to receive
either valsartan- or amlodipine-based antihypertensive treatment. Primary outcome was a composite of acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, admission attributed to heart failure, or sudden cardiac death. Blood pressure
was 145/82 and 144/81 mmHg, and glycosylated hemoglobin was 7.0% and 6.9% at baseline in the valsartan group and
the amlodipine group, respectively. Both of them were equally controlled between the 2 groups during the study. The
median follow-up period was 3.2 years, and primary outcome had occurred in 54 patients in the valsartan group and 56 in
the amlodipine group (hazard ratio: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.66–1.40]; P=0.85). Patients in the valsartan group had a significantly
lower incidence of heart failure than in the amlodipine group (hazard ratio: 0.20 [95% CI: 0.06–0.69]; P=0.01). Other
components and all-cause mortality were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Composite cardiovascular
outcomes were comparable between the valsartan- and amlodipine-based treatments in Japanese hypertensive patients
with glucose intolerance. Admission because of heart failure was significantly less in the valsartan group. (Hypertension.

"Abstract
Building on prior work related to taste preferences of fruit lovers, we investigate the ‘‘sweet tooth’’ hypothesis. First, using CSFII
survey data, we show that fruit consumption is more highly related to sweet snack consumption than it is to salty snack consumption.
Second, a follow-up study with a different population supports the relationship by showing that sweet snack consumption is more related
to fruit consumption than it is to vegetable consumption. Knowing that people who frequently eat sweet snacks may be predisposed to
increasing their fruit consumption will enable better targeting and tailoring of educational efforts, such as those used in the 5-a-Day for

There is a paucity of large-scale studies evaluating the clinical benefit of the Gaviscon Double Action (DA) alginate-antacid formulation for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms.

Aim
Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Gaviscon DA in reducing heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia symptoms in individuals with mild-to-moderate GERD in China.

Methods
Participants with symptomatic GERD (n = 1107) were randomised to receive Gaviscon DA or placebo (two tablets four times daily) for seven consecutive days. The primary endpoint compared the change in Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) score for the GERD (heartburn + regurgitation) dimension between Gaviscon DA and placebo. Secondary endpoints compared the change in RDQ scores for individual heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia dimensions, overall treatment evaluation (OTE) scores and incidence of adverse events (AEs).

Results
Mean RDQ GERD scores: 2.51 for Gaviscon DA and 2.50 for placebo at baseline; 1.25 for Gaviscon DA and 1.46 for placebo post treatment. Gaviscon DA was statistically superior to placebo in reducing GERD and dyspepsia RDQ scores [least-squares mean (LSM) difference: GERD −0.21, P < 0.0001; dyspepsia −0.18, P = 0.0004], despite a substantial placebo response. The Gaviscon DA group reported more favourable overall treatment responses than the placebo group across all OTE categories (P < 0.0001). Superior relief of GERD symptoms was observed both in those with non-erosive and those with erosive reflux disease (LSM difference −0.14 [P = 0.038] and −0.29 [P < 0.0001] respectively). Incidence of AEs was similar in both groups.

Conclusion
Gaviscon DA tablets provide effective and safe reduction in acid reflux and dyspepsia symptoms in Chinese individuals with mild-to-moderate GERD. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01869491",0
"ABSTRACT
Background: Medically Supervised Injection Centres (MSICs) are legally-sanctioned facilities where users can
consume pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision. Although there is a substantial body of research exploring their effectiveness, there have been few attempts to quantify outcomes across studies. In order to determine the impact of the body of research as a whole, outcomes from studies were synthesised using metaanalysis.
Methods: Literature sources were identified through searches in four bibliographic databases. Inclusion in the
final review was dependent on the study meeting certain eligibility criteria, including a minimum of pre-test,
post-test, control group designs. Data were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis using both fixed and random
effects methods.
Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, MSICs had a significant, but small, positive effect on
outcomes based on the fixed effect analysis and no effect based on random effect analysis. The results of the
independent outcome analyses showed that MSICs had a significant favourable result in relation to drug-related
crime and a significant unfavourable result in relation to problematic heroin use or injection. MSICs were found
to have no effect on overdose mortality or syringe/equipment sharing.
Conclusion: Whilst the effectiveness of the early versions of MSICs remains uncertain, this should not rule out
continuing to test and develop MSICs in locations where public injecting and other drug-related harms are a
major problem. It is important, however, that evaluation research publishes replicable data to enable future
meta-analyses and to expand the body of knowledge in the field.",0

Background
Thrombotic diseases are a group of prevalent and life-threatening diseases. Selective inhibition of pathological thrombosis holds the key to treat variety of thrombotic diseases. The pathological thrombosis can be induced by either tissue necrosis and deregulated inflammation. HMGB1, as an important proinflammatory cytokine and a late mediator, also involves on thrombosis disease. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

Methods
Immunofluorescence, ELISA assay, Platelet Aggregation, Thromboelastogram (TEG) analyzes. Flow cytometric analysis and Western blot analysis were used to investigated the role of HMGB1 in platelet aggregation and obtained following observations.

Results
By doing so, we obtained the following observations: i) Highly purified HMGB1 recombinant protein induces platelet aggregation and secretion in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of serum. ii) Low concentration of extracellular HMGB1 could synergistically promote subthreshold concentration of collagen or thrombin induced platelet aggregation. iii) Extracellular HMGB1 promoted platelet aggregation in a platelet-expressed GPIIb/IIIa-dependent manner. iv) We proposed that extracellular HMGB1 seems to promote the phosphorylation of GPIIb/IIIa and subsequent platelet aggregation via TLR4/NF-κB and cGMP pathway.

Conclusions
In this study, we provide evidence for the hypothesis that HMGB1 interact with platelet might play an important role in the haemostasis and thrombotic diseases. Our research might be provide an interesting avenue for the treatment of thrombotic diseases in the future.",0

Background
We investigated the mechanism of action of silymarin in a mouse model of renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (I/R) to ascertain its role in the treatment of I/R injury.

Methods
Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were divided randomly into three groups: control (sham); ischemia–reperfusion (I/R); silymarin + ischemia–reperfusion (silymarin + I/R). In sham mice, an abdominal incision was made, followed by dissection of the bilateral renal pedicle, with no further cross-clamping of arteries. Silymarin + I/R mice were administered 100 mg/kg silymarin daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery, whereas I/R mice were administered (i.g.) 0.9 % saline + 0.1 % (v/v) ethanol daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery. Silymarin + I/R and I/R mice were subjected to renal ischemia to induce acute kidney injury after 45-min clamping of bilateral renal arteries. Serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were measured. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining was undertaken to detect damaged renal tissue. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunofluorescent detection of CD68 expression was undertaken for each group. Levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted by renal tissue were monitored by ELISA. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Expression of cleaved-caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by western blotting.

Results
Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were elevated in silymarin + I/R and I/R groups compared with sham mice (p < 0.05), whereas those in the I/R group were significantly higher than in the silymarin + I/R group (p < 0.05). Number of damaged renal tubule cells and apoptotic cells in sham and silymarin + I/R groups was significantly lower than in I/R mice. MPO activity and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in silymarin + I/R and I/R groups was reduced (p < 0.05), and CD68 expression in silymarin + I/R mice was lower than in I/R mice (p < 0.05). Expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax in the I/R group was significantly higher than in sham mice, whereas Bcl-2 expression was lower than in silymarin + I/R mice (p < 0.05).

Conclusions
Silymarin can inhibit renal I/R injury by inhibiting release of inflammatory factors and regulating apoptosis.

"Abstract
Due to controversial evidence in the literature pertaining to the activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in platelets, we examined the effects of residual platelets present in plasma (a potential pre-analytical variable) on various plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-related assays. Blood samples were collected from 151 individuals and centrifuged at 352 and 1500 g to obtain plasma with varying numbers of platelet. In a follow-up study, blood samples were collected from an additional 23 individuals, from whom platelet-poor (2000 g), platelet-containing (352 g) and platelet-rich plasma (200 g) were prepared and analysed as fresh-frozen and after five defrost-refreeze cycles (to determine the contribution of in vitro platelet degradation). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen, tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, plasma clot lysis time, β-thromboglobulin and plasma platelet count were analysed. Platelet α-granule release (plasma β-thromboglobulin) showed a significant association with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels but weak associations with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and a functional marker of fibrinolysis, clot lysis time. Upon dividing the study population into quartiles based on β-thromboglobulin levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen increased significantly across the quartiles while plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and clot lysis time tended to increase in the 4th quartile only. In the follow-up study, plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen was also significantly influenced by platelet count in a concentration-dependent manner. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels increased further after complete platelet degradation. Residual platelets in plasma significantly influence plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels mainly through release of latent plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with limited effects on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex or plasma clot lysis time. Platelets may however also have functional effects on plasma fibrinolytic potential in the presence of high platelet counts, such as in platelet-rich plasma.",0

Introduction: The number of women postponing childbirth until an advanced age is
increasing. Our aim was to study the outcome of labor in nulliparous women
≥40 years, compared with women 2529 years, after both spontaneous onset and
induction of labor.
Material and methods: The nationwide populationbased Swedish Medical Birth
Register was used to study the perinatal outcome in nulliparous women with a singleton, term (gestational weeks 3744), live fetus in cephalic presentation and a planned
vaginal delivery from 1992 to 2011. We included 7796 nulliparous women ≥40 years
and 264 262 nulliparous women 2529 years. Prevalence and risk of intrapartum cesarean section, operative vaginal delivery, obstetric anal sphincter injury and a 5minute Apgar score <7 were calculated for women ≥40 years stratified for spontaneous
onset and induction of labor, using women 2529 years as the reference in both
strata. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results: Overall, 79% of women ≥40 years with a trial of labor reached a vaginal delivery. After spontaneous onset, intrapartum cesarean section was performed in
15.4% of women ≥40 years compared with 5.4% of women 2529 years (aOR 3.07,
95% CI 2.813.35). Operative vaginal delivery was performed in 22.3% of women
≥40 years compared with 14.2% of women 2529 years (aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.591.85).
After induction of labor, an intrapartum cesarean section was performed in 37.2%
women ≥40 years compared with 20.2% women 2529 years (aOR 2.51, 95% CI
2.242.81). Operative vaginal delivery was performed in 22.6% of women ≥40 years
compared with 18.4% women 2529 years (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.281.65). The risk of
obstetric anal sphincter injury or a 5minute Apgar score <7 was not increased in
women ≥40 years, regardless of onset of labor.
Conclusions: Trial of labor ended in vaginal delivery in 79% of nulliparous women
≥40 years. The risks of intrapartum cesarean section and operative vaginal delivery
were higher in women ≥40 years compared with women 2529 years, after both
spontaneous onset and induction of labor. The risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury

"Background and Aim. The aim of study was to evaluate safety, feasibility, and procedural variables of transradial approach compared with transfemoral approach in a standard population of patients undergoing coronary catheterization as one of the major criticisms of the transradial approach is that it takes longer overall procedure and fluoroscopy time, thereby causing more radiation exposure. Method. Between January 2015 and December 2015, a total of 1,997 patients in LPS Institute of Cardiology, GSVM Medical College, Kanpur, UP, India, undergoing coronary catheterization were randomly assigned to the transradial or transfemoral approach. Result. Successful catheterization was achieved in 1045 of 1076 patients (97.1%) in the transradial group and in 918 of 921 patients (99.7%) in the transfemoral group (p = 0.001). Comparing the transradial and transfemoral approaches, fluoroscopy time (2.46 ± 1.22 versus 2.83 ± 1.31 min; p = 0.32), procedure time (8.89 ± 2.72 versus 9.33 ± 2.82 min; p = 0.56), contrast volume (67.52 ± 22.54 versus 71.63 ± 25.41 mL; p = 0.32), radiation dose as dose area product (24.2 ± 4.21 versus 22.3 ± 3.46 Gycm2; p = 0.43), and postprocedural rise of serum creatinine (6 ± 4.5% versus 8 ± 2.6%; p = 0.41) were not significantly different while vascular access site complications were significantly lower in transradial group than transfemoral group (3.9% versus 7.6%; p = 0.04). Conclusion. The present study shows that transradial access for coronary angiography is safe among patients compared to transfemoral access with lower rate of local vascular complications.",0
"Abstract
The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.",0
"Abstract
NaCT is a Na+-coupled transporter for citrate expressed in hepatocytes and neurons. It is the mammalian ortholog of INDY (I’m Not Dead Yet), a transporter which modifies lifespan in Drosophila. Here we describe a hitherto unknown transport system for citrate in mammalian cells. When liver and mammary epithelial cells were pretreated with the iron supplement ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), uptake of citrate increased >10-fold. Iron chelators abrogated the stimulation of citrate uptake in FAC-treated cells. The iron exporter ferroportin had no role in this process. The stimulation of citrate uptake also occurred when Fe3+ was added during uptake without pretreatment. Similarly, uptake of Fe3+ was enhanced by citrate. The Fe3+-citrate uptake was coupled to Na+. This transport system was detectable in primary hepatocytes and neuronal cell lines. The functional features of this citrate transport system distinguish it from NaCT. Loss-of-function mutations in NaCT cause early-onset epilepsy and encephalopathy; the newly discovered Na+-coupled Fe3+-citrate transport system might offer a novel treatment strategy for these patients to deliver citrate into affected neurons independent of NaCT. It also has implications to iron-overload conditions where circulating free iron increases, which would stimulate cellular uptake of citrate and consequently affect multiple metabolic pathways.",0

antimicrobial activity against E. coli (IC50 = 2.10 µg/mL) and minimum activity against
S. aureus (IC50 = 43.63 µg/mL). Five antibiotics [trimethoprim (18 µg/g), fluconazole
(6 µg/g), ketoconazole (18 µg/g), nalidixic acid (135 µg/g), and rifampicin (56 µg/g)]

also detected in strain DST103 which may possibly be responsible for the production
of antimicrobial compounds. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

"Abstract
Numerous genetic alterations associated with cancer progression have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cancer. Numerous studies have suggested that claudin proteins, which are the primary components of tight junction structures, are associated with the regulation of cell polarity and cell differentiation. To investigate the expression profiles of the tight junction proteins claudin‑2, ‑5, ‑7 and ‑8 in gastric carcinoma, immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect the expression profiles of these claudin proteins in gastric carcinoma tissues and in homologous non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues. According to the present study, the expression levels of claudin‑7 and claudin‑8 were downregulated, while the expression of claudin‑5 was upregulated in gastric carcinoma tissues compared with in non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues. Additionally, no notable difference was observed between claudin‑2 expression in gastric carcinoma tissues and non‑neoplastic mucosae. Correlations between claudin‑7 and ‑8 expression and lymphatic metastasis in gastric carcinoma tissues were additionally reported. In summary, the present study revealed the distinct expression profiles of claudin‑5, ‑7 and ‑8 in non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues and gastric carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, the expression of these claudin proteins was highly associated with metastatic progression and prognosis in patients with gastric carcinoma, and had predictive value for the metastasis and survival of patients with gastric carcinoma.",0

Background
Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.
Methods
In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). On the basis of the results of an interim analysis, the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4.8 years.
Results
A total of 7447 persons were enrolled (age range, 55 to 80 years); 57% were women. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses. A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.92) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (96 events) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (83 events), respectively, versus the control group (109 events). No diet-related adverse effects were reported.
Conclusions
Among persons at high cardiovascular risk, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events. (Funded by the Spanish government's Instituto de Salud Carlos III and others; Controlled-Trials.com number, ISRCTN35739639.)",0
"Background
Decompressive laminectomy (DI) is a standard operation for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patient with severe claudication symptoms for many years. However, patients whose symptom severity does not meet undergoing invasive surgery make therapeutic options into dilemma. Interspinous spacers (ISP) bridge the gap between surgical interventions and CC in management of LSS. In our study, we aim to systematically assess the two FDA-approved interspinous spacers for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: Superion versus X-STOP.

Methods
Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library were searched to retrieve clinical trials concerning the comparison between Superion and X-STOP in treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis before April 2017. The following outcome measures were extracted: (1) Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) patient satisfaction score, (2) axial pain severity, (3) extremity pain severity, (4) back-specific functional impairment, (5) reoperation, and (6) complication. The data analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3.

Results
Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1118 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analysis indicated that the Superion group is superior to X-STOP in axial pain severity (SMD: 0.03; 95% CI 0.15, 0.45; p < 0.0001, I2 = 41%, p = 0.16), ZCQ patient satisfaction score (SMD: 0.23; 95% CI 0.08, 0.38; p = 0.002, I2 = 0%, p = 0.61). However, Superion group showed similarity outcome in extremity pain severity (SMD: 0.18; 95% CI − 0.06, 0.43; p = 0.14, I2 = 62%, p = 0.05), back-specific functional impairment (SMD: 0.04; 95% CI − 0.10, 0.19; p = 0.56, I2 = 0%, p = 0.77), reoperation rate (RR: 1.10; 95% CI 0.82, 1.48; p = 0.51, I2 = 19%, p = 0.30), and complication (RR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.63, 1.53; p = 0.92, I2 = 0%, p = 0.83).

Conclusion
Both the Superion and X-STOP interspinous spacers can relieve symptoms of LSS. In addition, the Superion spacer may represent a promising spacer for patient with LSS. As we know, the effectiveness and safety of ISP is still considered investigational and unfavor clinical results in the medical literature may continue to limit the appeal of IPS to many surgeons in the future. However, because of the advantage of IPS technique, it will win a wide place in the future degenerative lumbar microsurgery.

"Background
Diabetes and high body-mass index (BMI) are associated with increased risk of several cancers, and are increasing in prevalence in most countries. We estimated the cancer incidence attributable to diabetes and high BMI as individual risk factors and in combination, by country and sex.
Methods
We estimated population attributable fractions for 12 cancers by age and sex for 175 countries in 2012. We defined high BMI as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. We used comprehensive prevalence estimates of diabetes and BMI categories in 2002, assuming a 10-year lag between exposure to diabetes or high BMI and incidence of cancer, combined with relative risks from published estimates, to quantify contribution of diabetes and high BMI to site-specific cancers, individually and combined as independent risk factors and in a conservative scenario in which we assumed full overlap of risk of diabetes and high BMI. We then used GLOBOCAN cancer incidence data to estimate the number of cancer cases attributable to the two risk factors. We also estimated the number of cancer cases in 2012 that were attributable to increases in the prevalence of diabetes and high BMI from 1980 to 2002. All analyses were done at individual country level and grouped by region for reporting.
Findings
We estimated that 5·6% of all incident cancers in 2012 were attributable to the combined effects of diabetes and high BMI as independent risk factors, corresponding to 792 600 new cases. 187 600 (24·5%) of 766 000 cases of liver cancer and 121 700 (38·4%) of 317 000 cases of endometrial cancer were attributable to these risk factors. In the conservative scenario, about 4·5% (626 900 new cases) of all incident cancers assessed were attributable to diabetes and high BMI combined. Individually, high BMI (544 300 cases) was responsible for twice as many cancer cases as diabetes (280 100 cases). 26·1% of diabetes-related cancers (equating to 77 000 new cases) and 31·9% of high BMI-related cancers (174 040 new cases) were attributable to increases in the prevalence of these risk factors from 1980 to 2002.
Interpretation
A substantial number of cancer cases are attributable to diabetes and high BMI. As the prevalence of these cancer risk factors increases, clinical and public health efforts should focus on identifying optimal preventive and screening measures for whole populations and individual patients.

"ABSTRACT
The performance characteristics of the ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) Etest (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), MIC test strips (MTS; Liofilchem, Italy), and disk diffusion (Hardy, Santa Ana, CA) were evaluated for a collection of 308 beta-lactam-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered from three institutions in Los Angeles, CA. Reference testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution (rBMD) method. MIC and disk results were interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. Overall, 72.5% of the isolates were susceptible to C-T by rBMD. Etest and disk diffusion demonstrated acceptable performance, whereas MTS yielded a greater than acceptable percentage of minor errors. Categorical agreement was 96.8% for Etest, 87.0% for MTS, and 92.9% for disk diffusion. No very major errors were observed by any test, and no major errors (ME) were observed by Etest or disk diffusion. Two ME (0.9% of susceptible isolates) were observed by MTS. The incidence of minor errors was 3.2%, 12.3%, and 7.1% for Etest, MTS, and disk diffusion, respectively. Essential agreement (EA) for Etest was excellent, at 97.7%, whereas the MICs obtained by MTS tended to be 1 to 2 dilutions higher than those obtained by rBMD, with an EA of 87.0%.",0

Purpose
Studies on the association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and breast cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We quantitatively assessed this association by conducting a meta-analysis based on the evidence from observational studies.

Methods
We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published up to and including December 31, 2013. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for cancer risk.

Results
A total of 17 studies (9 cohort studies, 8 case-control studies) were selected for further study. These studies included 149,607 female subjects, of which 53,812 were CCBs users, who were followed for 2–16 years. The risks of breast cancer among patients receiving CCBs were significantly different for the pooled RRs (95% confidence interval) of cohort studies 1.08 (0.95, 1.20) and case-control studies 0.98 (0.86, 1.09). Differences were also noted for cancer risk, for CCBs use of <5 years 0.96 (0.78, 1.15), and for >5 years 1.01 (0.74, 1.28), as well as for ever used 1.08 (0.95, 1.20), and for current use 1.13 (0.83, 1.42). The RR for studies longer than 10 years was 1.71 (1.01, 2.42), and for studies evaluating nifedipine was 1.10 (0.87, 1.33) and diltiazem was 0.75 (0.40, 1.10).

Conclusions
The long-term use of CCBs appears to have a significant relationship with breast cancer. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to optimize the doses and types of these drugs needed to minimize their carcinogenic potential.",0

Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technologies have resulted in the accumulation of large data sets in the public domain, facilitating comparative studies to provide novel insights into the evolution of life. Phylogenetic studies across the eukaryotic taxa have been reported but on the basis of a limited number of genes. Here we present a genome-wide analysis across different plant, fungal, protist, and animal species, with reference to the 36,002 expressed genes of the rice genome. Our analysis revealed 9831 genes unique to rice and 98 genes conserved across all 49 eukaryotic species analysed. The 98 genes conserved across diverse eukaryotes mostly exhibited binding and catalytic activities and shared common sequence motifs; and hence appeared to have a common origin. The 98 conserved genes belonged to 22 functional gene families including 26S protease, actin, ADP–ribosylation factor, ATP synthase, casein kinase, DEAD-box protein, DnaK, elongation factor 2, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phosphatase 2A, ras-related protein, Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family protein, tubulin, ubiquitin and others. The consensus Bayesian eukaryotic tree of life developed in this study demonstrated widely separated clades of plants, fungi, and animals. Musa acuminata provided an evolutionary link between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, and Salpingoeca rosetta provided an evolutionary link between fungi and animals, which indicating that protozoan species are close relatives of fungi and animals. The divergence times for 1176 species pairs were estimated accurately by integrating fossil information with synonymous substitution rates in the comprehensive set of 98 genes. The present study provides valuable insight into the evolution of eukaryotes.",0
"Abstract
KIF3A/B, a kinesin involved in intraflagellar transport and Golgi trafficking, is distinctive because it contains two nonidentical motor domains. Our hypothesis is that the two heads have distinct functional properties, which are tuned to maximize the performance of the wild-type heterodimer. To test this, we investigated the motility of wild-type KIF3A/B heterodimer and chimaeric KIF3A/A and KIF3B/B homodimers made by splicing the head of one subunit to the rod and tail of the other. The first result is that KIF3A/B is processive, consistent with its transport function in cells. Secondly, the KIF3B/B homodimer moves at twice the speed of the wild-type motor but has reduced processivity, suggesting a trade-off between speed and processivity. Third, the KIF3A/A homodimer moves fivefold slower than wild-type, demonstrating distinct functional differences between the two heads. The heterodimer speed cannot be accounted for by a sequential head model in which the two heads alternate along the microtubule with identical speeds as in the homodimers. Instead, the data are consistent with a coordinated head model in which detachment of the slow KIF3A head from the microtubule is accelerated roughly threefold by the KIF3B head.

"Abstract
Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is associated with pancreatic and colorectal cancer, among others. To-date, there are no FDA-approved small molecule Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors and many past efforts resulted in compounds with undesirable off-target effects. We recently identified a series of benzimidazole analogs as potent inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Here, we show that the lead compound SRI36160 displayed selective Wnt inhibition and potent antiproliferative activity in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, SRI36160 had no effect on STAT3 and mTORC1 signaling in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, and was not effective in inhibiting proliferation of non-cancerous cells. Our findings suggest that this series of benzimidazole analogs presents a novel approach for the treatment of Wnt-dependent cancers such as colorectal and pancreatic cancer.

"The use of the iron chelator deferiprone (L1, CP20, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one) for the treatment
of diseases of iron overload and other disorders is problematic and requires further evaluation. In this study
the efficacy, toxicity and mechanism of action of orally administered L1 were investigated in the guinea pig
using the carbonyl iron model of iron overload. In an acute trial, depletion of liver non-heme iron in drugtreated guinea pigs (normal iron status) was maximal (approximately 50% of control) after a single oral
dose of L1 of 200 mg kg–1, suggesting a limited chelatable pool in normal tissue. There was no apparent
toxicity up to 600 mg kg–1. In each of two sub-acute trials, normal and iron-loaded animals were fed L1
(300 mg kg–1 day–1) or placebo for six days. Final mortalities were 12/20 (L1) and 0/20 (placebo). Symptoms
included weakness, weight loss and eye discharge. Iron-loaded as well as normal guinea pigs were affected,
indicating that at this drug level iron loading was not protective. In a chronic trial guinea pigs received
L1 (50 mg kg–1 day–1) or placebo for six days per week over eight months. Liver non-heme iron was reduced
in animals iron-loaded prior to the trial. The increase in a wave latency (electroretinogram), the foci of
hepatic, myocardial and musculo-skeletal necrosis, and the decrease in white blood cells in the drugtreated/normal diet group even at the low dose of 50 mg kg–1 day–1 suggests that L1 may be unsuitable for
the treatment of diseases which do not involve Fe overload. However, the low level of pathology in animals
treated with iron prior to the trial suggests that even a small degree of iron overload (two-fold after eight
months) is protective at this drug level. We conclude that the relationship between drug dose and iron status
is critical in avoiding toxicity and must be monitored rigorously as cellular iron is depleted.",0

Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a potential anti-apoptotic agent for various cells. We examined the protective effect of ANGPTL4 on hypoxia/serum deprivation (SD)-induced apoptosis of MSCs, as well as the possible mechanisms. MSCs were obtained from rat bone marrow and cultured in vitro. Apoptosis was induced by hypoxia/SD for up to 24 hr, and assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Expression levels of Akt, ERK1/2, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by Western blotting. Integrin β1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed using a membrane-permeable dye. Hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated by recombinant rat ANGPTL4 in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, ANGPTL4 decreased the hypoxia/SD-induced caspase-3 cleavage and the cytochrome C release, but increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Decreased expression of integrin β1, the ANGPTL4 receptor was observed during hypoxia/SD conditions, however, such decrease was reversed by ANGPTL4. In addition, ANGPTL4 induced integrin β1-associated FAK and Src phosphorylation, which was blocked by anti-integrin β1 antibody. ANGPTL4 also reversed the hypoxia/SD-induced decrease of Akt and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, and the effect of ANGPTL4 was abolished by inhibitors of either integrins, ERK1/2, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Blocking integrinβ1, Akt or ERK largely attenuated anti-apoptotic effect of ANGPTL4. ANGPTL4 protects MSCs from hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis by interacting with integrins to stimulate FAK complex, leading to downstream ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and mimicking the pathway in which MSCs contact with the extracellular matrix.",0

Importance
Psychiatric nosology is limited by behavioral and biological heterogeneity within existing disorder categories. The imprecise nature of current nosological distinctions limits both mechanistic understanding and clinical prediction. Here, we demonstrate an approach consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to identifying superior, neurobiologically-valid subgroups with better predictive capacity than existing psychiatric categories for childhood Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Objective
Refine subtyping of childhood ADHD by using biologically-based behavioral dimensions (i.e. temperament), novel classification algorithms, and multiple external validators. In doing so, we demonstrate how refined nosology is capable of improving on current predictive capacity of long-term outcomes relative to current DSM-based nosology.

Design, Setting, Participants
437 clinically well-characterized, community-recruited children with and without ADHD participated in an on-going longitudinal study. Baseline data were used to classify children into subgroups based on temperament dimensions and to examine external validators including physiological and MRI measures. One-year longitudinal follow-up data are reported for a subgroup of the ADHD sample to address stability and clinical prediction.

Main Outcome Measures
Parent/guardian ratings of children on a measure of temperament were used as input features in novel community detection analyses to identify subgroups within the sample. Groups were validated using three widely-accepted external validators: peripheral physiology (cardiac measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period), central nervous system functioning (via resting-state functional connectivity MRI), and clinical outcomes (at one-year longitudinal follow-up).

Results
The community detection algorithm suggested three novel types of ADHD, labeled as “Mild” (normative emotion regulation); “Surgent” (extreme levels of positive approach-motivation); and “Irritable” (extreme levels of negative emotionality, anger, and poor soothability). Types were independent of existing clinical demarcations, including DSM-5 presentations or symptom severity. These types showed stability over time and were distinguished by unique patterns of cardiac physiological response, resting-state functional brain connectivity, and clinical outcome one year later.

Conclusions and Relevance
Results suggest that a biologically-informed temperament-based typology, developed with a discovery-based community detection algorithm, provided a superior description of heterogeneity in the ADHD population than any current clinical nosology. This demonstration sets the stage for more aggressive attempts at a tractable, biologically-based nosology.",0
"Abstract
We prospectively studied the clinical efficacy of an alternative cancer treatment “Psorinum Therapy” in treating stomach, gall bladder, pancreatic and liver cancers. Our study was observational, open level and single arm. The participants' eligibility criteria included histopathology/cytopathology confirmation of malignancy, inoperable tumor, and no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The primary outcome measures of the study were (i) to assess the radiological tumor response (ii) to find out how many participants survived at least 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and finally 5 years after the beginning of the study considering each type of cancer. Psorinum-6x was administered orally to all the participants up to 0.02 ml/Kg body weight as a single dose in empty stomach per day for 2 years along with allopathic and homeopathic supportive cares. 158 participants (42 of stomach, 40 of gall bladder, 44 of pancreatic, 32 of liver) were included in the final analysis of the study. Complete tumor response occurred in 28 (17.72%) cases and partial tumor response occurred in 56 (35.44%) cases. Double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial should be conducted for further scientific exploration of this alternative cancer treatment.",0
"Abstract
Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides means for unconditional secure key transmission between two distant parties. However, in practical implementations, it suffers from quantum hacking due to device imperfections. Here we propose a hybrid measurement attack, with only linear optics, homodyne detection, and single photon detection, to the widely used vacuum + weak decoy state QKD system when the phase of source is partially randomized. Our analysis shows that, in some parameter regimes, the proposed attack would result in an entanglement breaking channel but still be able to trick the legitimate users to believe they have transmitted secure keys. That is, the eavesdropper is able to steal all the key information without discovered by the users. Thus, our proposal reveals that partial phase randomization is not sufficient to guarantee the security of phase-encoding QKD systems with weak coherent states.

"Abstract
Carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) have become a growing concern in terms of their fate and toxicity in aqueous environments. Methane (CH4) is a major product of organic matter degradation in waterlogged environments. In this study, we determined the effect of MWCNTs-COOH on the production of CH4 from propionate oxidation in paddy soil enrichments. The results showed that the methanogenesis from propionate degradation was accelerated in the presence of MWCNTs-COOH. In addition, the rates of CH4 production and propionate degradation increased with increasing concentrations of MWCNTs-COOH. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed that the cells were intact and maintained their structure in the presence of MWCNTs-COOH. In addition, SEM and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images revealed that the cells were in direct contact with the MWCNTs and formed cell-MWCNTs aggregates that contained both bacteria and archaea. On the other hand, nontoxic magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) had similar effects on the CH4 production and cell integrity as the MWCNTs-COOH. Compared with no nanomaterial addition, the relative abundances of Geobacter and Methanosarcina species increased in the presence of MWCNTs-COOH. This study suggests that MWCNTs-COOH exerted positive rather than cytotoxic effects on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate in paddy soil enrichments and affected the bacterial and archaeal community structure at the test concentrations. These findings provide novel insight into the consequences of nanomaterial release into anoxic natural environments.

"Abstract
To understand and characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) has been used to induce acute and chronic colitis in animal models by causing intestinal epithelium damage. The mechanism of action of DSS in producing this outcome is not well understood. In an effort to understand how DSS might impact epithelial cell metabolism, we studied the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 incubated with 1% DSS over 56 hours using 1H NMR spectroscopy. We observed no difference in cell viability as compared to control cultures, and an approximately 1.5-fold increase in IL-6 production upon incubation with 1% DSS. The effect on Caco-2 cell metabolism as measured through changes in the concentration of metabolites in the cell supernatant included a three-fold decrease in the concentration of alanine. Given that the concentrations of other amino acids in the cell culture supernatant were not different between treated and control cultures over 56 hours suggest that DSS inhibits alanine synthesis, specifically alanine aminotransferase, without affecting other key metabolic pathways. The importance of alanine aminotransferase in inflammatory bowel disease is discussed.

"Abstract
Anecdotal and clinical reports have suggested that radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs) may serve as a trigger for neuropathic pain. However, these reports have been widely disregarded, as the epidemiological effects of electromagnetic fields have not been systematically proven, and are highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that anthropogenic RF EMFs elicit post-neurotomy pain in a tibial neuroma transposition model. Behavioral assays indicate a persistent and significant pain response to RF EMFs when compared to SHAM surgery groups. Laser thermometry revealed a transient skin temperature increase during stimulation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed an increased expression of temperature sensitive cation channels (TRPV4) in the neuroma bulb, suggesting that RF EMF-induced pain may be due to cytokine-mediated channel dysregulation and hypersensitization, leading to thermal allodynia. Additional behavioral assays were performed using an infrared heating lamp in place of the RF stimulus. While thermally-induced pain responses were observed, the response frequency and progression did not recapitulate the RF EMF effects. In vitro calcium imaging experiments demonstrated that our RF EMF stimulus is sufficient to directly contribute to the depolarization of dissociated sensory neurons. Furthermore, the perfusion of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α resulted in a significantly higher percentage of active sensory neurons during RF EMF stimulation. These results substantiate patient reports of RF EMF-pain, in the case of peripheral nerve injury, while confirming the public and scientific consensus that anthropogenic RF EMFs engender no adverse sensory effects in the general population.",0

Youth in poor neighborhoods have high emotional problem rates. Understanding neighborhood influences on these rates is crucial for designing neighborhood-level interventions.

Objective
To do exploratory analysis of associations between housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods and subsequent mental disorders during adolescence.

Design, Setting, and Participants
The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration in 1994-1998 randomized 4,604 volunteer public housing families with children in high-poverty neighborhoods into Low-poverty voucher (LPV) or Traditional voucher (TRV) interventions to encourage moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods or a Control group. An evaluation 10-15 years later (June 2008-April 2010)interviewed (blinded to assignment) participants aged 0-8 at randomization and 13-19 at follow-up. Response rates were 86.9-92.9%.

Interventions
LPV (n=1,430) received vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods with enhanced mobility counseling. TRV (n=1,081) received geographically unrestricted vouchers. Controls (n=1,178) received no intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures
Twelve-month DSM-IV major depressive, panic, post-traumatic stress (PTSD), oppositional-defiant, intermittent explosive, and conduct disorders assessed post hoc with a validated research diagnostic interview.

Results
3,689 children were randomized and 2,872 interviewed (1,407 boys, median age 16 range: 13-19; 1,465 girls, median age 16, range 13-19). Boys had significantly elevated rates of major depression in LPV (7.1% [95% CI, 4.1-10.1%]; OR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2-3.9]) versus Controls (3.5% [95% CI, 2.3-4.6%]), PTSD in LPV (6.2% [95% CI, 4.7-7.7%]; OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.4]) and TRV (4.9% [95% CI, 3.0-6.8%]; OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.2-5.8]) versus Controls (1.9% [95% CI, 0.9-2.9%]), and conduct disorder in LPV (6.4% [95% CI, 4.7-8.1%];OR, 3.1[95% CI, 1.7-5.8]) versus Controls (2.1% [95% CI, 1.1-3.2%]). TRV girls had reduced rates of major depression (6.5% [95% CI, 4.5-8.4%]; OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-0.9 ]) versus Controls (10.9% [95% CI, 8.4-13.4%]) and conduct disorder (0.3% [95% CI, 0.0-0.7%]; OR, 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.4]) versus Controls (2.9% [95% CI, 1.1-4.7%]).

Conclusions and Relevance
Interventions to encourage moving from high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with elevated depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes.

"Abstract
The biogenesis and activity of chloroplasts in both vascular plants and algae depends on an intracellular network of nucleus-encoded, trans-acting factors that control almost all aspects of organellar gene expression. Most of these regulatory factors belong to the helical repeat protein superfamily, which includes tetratricopeptide repeat, pentatricopeptide repeat, and the recently identified octotricopeptide repeat (OPR) proteins. Whereas green algae express many different OPR proteins, only a single orthologous OPR protein is encoded in the genomes of most land plants. Here, we report the characterization of the only OPR protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, RAP, which has previously been implicated in plant pathogen defense. Loss of RAP led to a severe defect in processing of chloroplast 16S rRNA resulting in impaired chloroplast translation and photosynthesis. In vitro RNA binding and RNase protection assays revealed that RAP has an intrinsic and specific RNA binding capacity, and the RAP binding site was mapped to the 5′ region of the 16S rRNA precursor. Nucleoid localization of RAP was shown by transient green fluorescent protein import assays, implicating the nucleoid as the site of chloroplast rRNA processing. Taken together, our data indicate that the single OPR protein in Arabidopsis is important for a basic process of chloroplast biogenesis.",0

The thermal behavior of heavy metals in the co-incineration of municipal solid waste-sludge incinerator fly ash (MSS fly ash) was studied using a laboratory-scale tube furnace. The results indicate that without the addition of chlorinating agents, temperature was an important parameter and had significantly influenced on heavy metal removal, whereas the residence time had a weak effect. Between 900 and 1000 °C for 60 to 300 min, heavy metals reacted with chloride-inherent in the fly ash, and approximately 80 to 89% of Pb, 48% to 56% of Cd, 27% to 36% of Zn and 6% to 24% of Cu were removed. After the adding chlorinating agents, the evaporation rate of the heavy metals improved dramatically, where the evaporation rates of Cu and Zn were larger than that of Pb and Cd. As the amount of added chlorinating agents increased, the removal rate of heavy metals increased. However, the effect of the type of chlorinating agent on the chlorination of heavy metals differed considerably, where NaCl had the weakest effect on the removal rate of Cu, Cd and Zn. In terms of resource recovery and decontamination, MgCl2 and CaCl2 are the best choices due to their efficient removal of Zn.",0
"Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed as being a signaling molecule in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf senescence. Intracellular H2O2 levels are controlled by the H2O2-scavenging enzyme catalase in concert with other scavenging and producing systems. Catalases are encoded by a small gene family, and the expression of all three Arabidopsis catalase genes is regulated in a senescence-associated manner. CATALASE2 (CAT2) expression is down-regulated during bolting time at the onset of leaf senescence and appears to be involved in the elevation of the H2O2 level at this time point. To understand the role of CAT2 in senescence regulation in more detail, we used CAT2 promoter fragments in a yeast one-hybrid screen to isolate upstream regulatory factors. Among others, we could identify G-Box Binding Factor1 (GBF1) as a DNA-binding protein of the CAT2 promoter. Transient overexpression of GBF1 together with a CAT2:β-glucuronidase construct in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants and Arabidopsis protoplasts revealed a negative effect of GBF1 on CAT2 expression. In gbf1 mutant plants, the CAT2 decrease in expression and activity at bolting time and the increase in H2O2 could no longer be observed. Consequently, the onset of leaf senescence and the expression of senescence-associated genes were delayed in gbf1 plants, clearly indicating a regulatory function of GBF1 in leaf senescence, most likely via regulation of the intracellular H2O2 content.",0

Background. Treatment selection for small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) is controversial. We aimed to compare the outcomes of medical imaging three-dimensional visualization system (MI-3DVS) guided surgical resection (SR) and ultrasonography guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for sHCC. Methods. In total, 194 patients who underwent SR or RFA in our hospital between January 2006 and May 2010 were retrospectively enrolled. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and postoperative complications were compared. Cox regression was used to estimate the benefits of MI-3DVS-guided SR on OS and RFS. Results. Ninety-two patients underwent SR and 102 underwent RFA. The SR group experienced more complications (41.3% versus 19.6%) and longer hospital stay (18.04 ± 7.11 versus 13.06 ± 5.59) (both p < 0.05). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS was 96.7%, 95.7%, 93.5%, 83.5%, and 61.1% in the SR group and 95.0%, 88.1%, 72.7%, 56.9%, and 39.5% in the RFA group. Corresponding RFS was 95.7%, 94.6%, 84.7%, 59.8%, and 40.2% in SR group and 91.2%, 80.3%, 60.5%, 32.3%, and 22.3% in RFA group. The 5-year OS and RFS were higher in SR group (both p < 0.001). Interestingly, there was no significance in OS and RFS among subgroups aged >60 years. Independent predictors of OS and RFS, respectively, were intervention (HR, 2.769 and 1.933), tumor number (HR, 5.128 and 3.903), and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR, 1.871 and 1.474) (all p < 0.05). Conclusions. MI-3DVS based hepatectomy should be considered primary treatment while RFA can be treated as alternative therapy for older patients. Intervention, tumor number, and AFP are independent predictors for both survival and recurrence.",0
"Abstract
The initiation of DNA replication is a highly regulated process in eukaryotic cells, and central to the process of initiation is the assembly and activation of the replication fork helicase. The replication fork helicase is comprised of CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2–7, and GINS) in eukaryotic cells, and the mechanism underlying assembly of the CMG during S phase was studied in this article. We identified a point mutation of Sld3 that is specifically defective for Mcm3 and Mcm5 interaction (sld3-m10), and also identified a point mutation of Sld3 that is specifically defective for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) interaction (sld3-m9). Expression of wild-type levels of sld3-m9 resulted in a severe DNA replication defect with no recruitment of GINS to Mcm2–7, whereas expression of wild-type levels of sld3-m10 resulted in a severe replication defect with no Cdc45 recruitment to Mcm2–7. We propose a model for Sld3-mediated control of replication initiation, wherein Sld3 manages the proper assembly of the CMG during S phase. We also find that the biochemical functions identified for Sld3 are conserved in human Treslin, suggesting that Treslin orchestrates assembly of the CMG in human cells.",0
"Abstract
Functional interactions between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during working memory have been studied extensively as an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. Coupling abnormalities have been found in patients, their unaffected siblings, and carriers of common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, but the global genetic architecture of this imaging phenotype is unclear. To achieve genome-wide hypothesis-free identification of genes and pathways associated with prefrontal–hippocampal interactions, we combined gene set enrichment analysis with whole-genome genotyping and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 269 healthy German volunteers. We found significant enrichment of the synapse organization and biogenesis gene set. This gene set included known schizophrenia risk genes, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, beta 2 subunit (CACNB2), as well as genes with well-defined roles in neurodevelopmental and plasticity processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and have mechanistic links to prefrontal–hippocampal functional interactions. Our results demonstrate a readily generalizable approach that can be used to identify the neurogenetic basis of systems-level phenotypes. Moreover, our findings identify gene sets in which genetic variation may contribute to disease risk through altered prefrontal–hippocampal functional interactions and suggest a link to both ongoing and developmental synaptic plasticity.",0
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) can phosphorylate
and degrade β-catenin, and negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. MiR-224
up-regulation is associated with colorectal
cancer (CRC). Bioinformatics analysis showed
complementary binding sites between miR-224
and GSK-3β. This study investigated if miR-224
plays a role in mediating GSK-3β expression,
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity, CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis as well as drug sensitivity of
Adriamycin (ADM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual luciferase gene reporter assay demonstrated the regulatory relationship between miR-224 and GSK3β. Expression of miR-224, GSK-3β, β-catenin, and Survivin was measured in normal colon
epithelium NCM460, CRC cell line SW480, and
drug-resistant SW480/ADM cell line. Flow cytometry measured apoptosis under ADM with
an IC50 concentration of SW480 cells, followed
by CCK-8 analysis of cell proliferation. SW480/
ADM cells were treated with miR-224 inhibitor
and/or pSicoR-GSK-3β, followed by analysis of
the expressions of GSK-3β, β-catenin and Survivin, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation by
EdU staining.
RESULTS: MiR-224 targeted and inhibited
GSK-3β expression. In SW480/ADM cells, GSK3β expression and cell apoptosis rate were lower than those in SW480 cells, whilst miR-224,
β-catenin, and Survivin expression or proliferation were higher than those in SW480 cells.
Transfection of miR-224 inhibitor and/or pSicoR-GSK-3β significantly increased GSK-3β expression in SW480/ADM cells, and decreased
β-catenin and Survivin expression, leading to
reduced proliferation potency, enhanced cell
apoptosis and suppressed ADM resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-224 up-regulation is associated with ADM resistance of CRC cells. Suppression of miR-224 expression up-regulated
GSK-3β expression, inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway activity and Survivin expression, as
well as reduced ADM resistance of CRC SW480

In the current study, we demonstrated that YL-0919 produced prominent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) rat model. Male SD rats were exposed to CUS for 5 weeks; YL-0919 (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) or a positive control fluoxetine (Flx, 10 mg/kg) was orally administered daily. YL-0919 or Flx treatment significantly increased the sucrose preference rate, the locomotor activity in an open field test (OFT), the latency to feed in a novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and both the percentage of time spent in the open arms and the number of entries into the open arms in an elevated plus-maze test. YL-0919 or Flx treatment significantly suppressed the serum levels of ACTH and corticosterone in CUS-exposed rats. Additionally, YL-0919 or Flx treatment significantly enhanced the levels of cAMP, the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of CUS-exposed rats. Similar to Flx, YL-0919 treatment significantly enhanced the dendritic complexity, and increased the number of dendritic nodes as well as the spine length and number of branch nodes in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of CUS-exposed rats. Overall, our results reveal that YL-0919 suppresses the HPA axis and exerts antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in CUS-exposed rats, which are associated with the enhanced cAMP signaling and hippocampal dendritic complexity.

"SUMMARY
Background
Survivors of preterm-birth have increased prevalence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases in later life however, the overall impact of prematurity on cardiorespiratory exercise capacity is unclear.

Objective
We, therefore, systematically reviewed the literature on cardiorespiratory exercise capacity in survivors of preterm birth.

Methodology
Relevant studies up to March 2013 were searched using eight electronic health databases. Studies reporting exercise capacity in participants born preterm (<37 weeks) were included. The main outcome of interest was oxygen uptake (urn:x-wiley:14381656:media:ppul23117:ppul23117-math-0001) at maximal exercise. Data were categorized into four groups: (i) preterm-born subjects including those with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) but excluding study groups biased towards BPD; (ii) preterm-born subjects (BPD excluded); (iii) preterm-born subjects who had BPD28 (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life) in infancy; (iv) preterm born subjects with BPD36 (oxygen dependency at 36 weeks post menstrual age) in infancy.

Results
From 9,341 abstracts, 22 included publications reported urn:x-wiley:14381656:media:ppul23117:ppul23117-math-0001 in ml/kg/min from 685 preterm and 680 term-born subjects. Overall 20 studies reported results for preterm-born subjects including BPD; 14 studies for the preterm group excluding BPD; 10 studies for the BPD28 group; and 8 studies for BPD36 group. The mean differences (95% CI) for the four groups were −2.20 (−3.70, −0.70) ml/kg/min; −2.26 (−4.44, −0.07 ml/kg/min; −3.04 (−5.48, −0.61) ml/kg/min, and −3.05 (−5.93, −0.18) ml/kg/min, respectively.

Conclusion
Despite marked deficits in spirometry, preterm-born children have a marginally decreased urn:x-wiley:14381656:media:ppul23117:ppul23117-math-0001, which is unlikely to be of great clinical significance. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50:293–301. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",1

"Handwriting serves to link auditory and motor routines with visual word processing,
which is a hallmark of successful reading. The current study aims to explore the effect of
multisensory integration as a pathway to neural specialization for print among typical and
dyslexic readers across writing systems. We identified 9–10-year-old dyslexic Chinese
children (n = 24) and their typically developing counterparts (n = 24) on whom we
conducted both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments. We designed
four learning conditions: Handwriting Chinese (HC), Viewing Chinese (VC), Drawing
followed by Character Recognition in Chinese (D-C), and Drawing followed by Word
Recognition in English (D-E). In both handwriting and drawing conditions, we also
designed curved vs. straight-line stimuli. Both behavioral and EEG results showed that
handwriting straight line strokes facilitated visual word recognition in Chinese compared
to handwriting curved lines. Handwriting conditions resulted in a lateralization of the
N170 in typical readers, but not the dyslexic readers. Interestingly, drawing curved
lines facilitate word recognition in English among dyslexic readers. Taken together,
the results of the study suggest benefits of handwriting on the neural processing and
behavioral performance in response to Chinese character recognition and curved-line
drawing effects on English word recognition among dyslexic readers. But the lack of
handwriting effects in dyslexic readers suggest that students who have deficits in reading
may also be missing the link between multisensory integration and word recognition in
the visual word form areas. The current study results have implications for maintaining
handwriting practices to promote perception and motor integration for visual word form
area development for normal readers and suggest that drawing practices might benefit
Chinese dyslexic readers in reading English.",1
"Abstract
Liver fibrosis is a progressive disease accompanied by the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Numerous reports have demonstrated that alterations in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) are related to liver disease. However, the effect of individual miRNAs on liver fibrosis has not been studied. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), being responsible for producing ECM, exert an important influence on liver fibrosis. Then, microarray analysis of non-activated and activated HSCs induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) showed that miR-130b-5p expression was strongly up-regulated during HSC activation. Moreover, the progression of liver fibrosis had a close connection with the expression of miR-130b-5p in different liver fibrosis mouse models. Then, we identified that there were specific binding sites between miR-130b-5p and the 3′ UTR of Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) via a luciferase reporter assay. Knockdown of miR-130b-5p increased SIRT4 expression and ameliorated liver fibrosis in mice transfected with antagomiR-130b-5p oligos. In general, our results suggested that miR-130b-5p promoted HSC activation by targeting SIRT4, which participates in the AMPK/TGF-β/Smad2/3 signalling pathway. Hence, regulating miR-130b-5p maybe serve as a crucial therapeutic treatment for hepatic fibrosis.",1
"Abstract
Background: The prevalence of cigarette smoking is a significant public health challenge in Saudi Arabia, as it is a known risk factor for many health problems. Hearing problems are also a major concern, as they are invisible disabilities that can negatively impact an individual's perception, communication, and social interactions. Studies have identified various risk factors for hearing loss, including genetics, diseases, infection, exposure to noise, and demographic factors such as age and gender. Smoking has been found to be associated with hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, but the results of studies investigating this association have been inconsistent. It is crucial to understand the impact of smoking on hearing problems and tinnitus in the Saudi Arabian population to protect individual and societal health.

Aim: We aim to investigate whether smoking is related to tinnitus, hearing loss, or other hearing difficulties.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was established from March to August 2022 among adults in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to determine whether smoking can affect hearing.

Results: It has been observed that smokers experience hearing issues or trouble hearing more frequently than non-smokers. Additionally, as the number of cigarette smoking grows or as smoking persists for longer periods of time, there is a rise in hearing problems/hearing difficulty. In contrast, there is no conclusive evidence associating smoking and tinnitus.

Conclusion: These results should encourage more investigation into the impact of demographic factors on hearing problems/hearing difficulty, or tinnitus.

"Aim: To evaluate the effect of different endodontic irrigation regimens on the sealing ability of resin
composite restorations placed within the pulp chamber using contemporary simpliied adhesives.
Materials and Methods: Seventy‑ive extracted human molars were divided into six groups. After
de‑rooing the pulp chamber and extirpating the pulp, pulp chambers were bonded with either
G-Bond after irrigation with saline (Group 1); ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium
hypochlorite (NaOCl) (Group 2), and NaOCl + QMix (Group 3) or bonded with OptiBond adhesive
after irrigation with saline (Group 4), EDTA and NaOCl (Group 5), and NaOCl + QMix (Group 6). All the
samples were restored with composite. Ten samples per group were assessed for dye penetration. Fifteen
samples were assessed under scanning electron microscope. Data were statistically analyzed using
Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests at a signiicance level of P < 0.05. Results: Both EDTA + NaOCl
or NaOCl + QMix pretreatment of pulp chamber dentin signiicantly reduced microleakage scores in

INTRODUCTION
Nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been frequently used for smoking cessation. The aim of this review is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of e-cigarettes versus NRT for smoking cessation.

METHODS
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library from inception to 10 October 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing e-cigarettes versus NRT for smoking cessation. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility. Paired authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the certainty of evidence.

RESULTS
The study included five RCTs with 1748 participants. The meta-analysis suggested the e-cigarettes versus NRT increased the ≥6 months continuous abstinence rate (RR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.21–2.28; 55 more per 1000 participants, low certainty), and 7-day point abstinence rate at ≥6 months follow-up (RR=1.43; 95% CI: 1.19–1.72; 84 more per 1000, low certainty). However, we found no evidence that e-cigarettes versus NRT increased 3–6 months continuous abstinence rate (RR=1.07; 95% CI: 0.73–1.57; 10 more per 1000, very low certainty) and <3 months continuous abstinence rate (RR=1.20; 95% CI: 0.90–1.60; 54 more per 1000, low certainty); similar results were found at <3 months follow-up (RR=1.19; 95% CI: 0.92–1.54; 55 more per 1000, very low certainty) and 3–6 months follow-up in 7-day point abstinence rate (RR=1.01; 95% CI: 0.70–1.44; 2 more per 1000, very low certainty). The adverse events were not significant between e-cigarettes and NRT other than throat irritation (RR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.13–1.42; 118 more per 1000, low certainty).

CONCLUSIONS
E-cigarettes appeared to be superior to NRT in ≥6 months continuous abstinence rate and 7-day point abstinence rate. At short-term duration, we found no evidence that e-cigarettes compared to NRT increased the <6 months continuous abstinence rate and 7-day point abstinence rate.

Background
The prevalence of sarcopenia with osteoporosis results in a higher risk of falling and fractures. It was noted that patients who had completed their planned 5-year denosumab therapy course as treatment for these conditions started to sustain falls.

Purpose
To assess (a) whether denosumab has a unique dual effect on both bone and muscle in comparison to other anti-resorptive agents and (b) its effectiveness in the follow-up period post-treatment completion compared to other anti-resorptive agents.

Method
One hundred thirty-five patients diagnosed to have postmenopausal/senile osteoporosis and who were prescribed denosumab were compared to a control group of 272 patients stratified into 2 subgroups – 136 prescribed alendronate and 136 prescribed zoledronate. All patients were assessed for: BMD (DXA), falls risk (FRAS), fracture risk (FRAX), and sarcopenia measures. All were re-assessed after 5 years of denosumab/alendronate therapy and 3 years of zoledronate and 1 year after stopping the osteoporosis therapy.

Results
No significant baseline demographic differences between the 3 groups. On completion of the 5-year denosumab therapy, there was significant decrease in falls risk (P = 0.001) and significant improvements in all sarcopenia measures (P = 0.01). One-year post-discontinuation of denosumab, a significant worsening of both falls risk and sarcopenia measures (P = 0.01) noticed.

Conclusion
Denosumab displayed positive impact and significant improvements in BMD and sarcopenia measures. It also enhanced multidirectional agility as depicted by Timed Up and Go (TUG). Collectively, this would explain the reduction of falls risk which got worse on stopping the medication.

Key points

• The coexistence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia has been recently considered in some groups as a syndrome termed 'osteosarcopenia'.

• Bone and muscle closely interact with each other not only anatomically, but also at the chemical and metabolic levels.

• Denosumab displayed positive impact and significant improvements in all sarcopenia measures, and enhanced multidirectional agility with consequent reduction in falls risk.

• Denosumab can be considered as a first osteoporosis therapeutic option in this group of patients presenting with osteosarcopenia manifestations.

"Background Basilar artery occlusion is a rare and severe condition. The effectiveness of endovascular thrombectomy
in patients with basilar artery occlusion was unclear until recently, because these patients were excluded from most
trials of endovascular thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion ischaemic stroke.
Recent developments The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) and the Basilar Artery Occlusion
Endovascular Intervention versus Standard Medical Treatment (BEST) trials, specifically designed to investigate the
benefit of thrombectomy in patients with basilar artery occlusion, did not find significant evidence of a benefit of
endovascular thrombectomy in terms of disability outcomes at 3 months after stroke. However, these trials suggested
a potential benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in patients presenting with moderate-to-severe symptoms.
Subsequently, the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion (ATTENTION) and the Basilar Artery
Occlusion Chinese Endovascular (BAOCHE) trials, which compared endovascular thrombectomy versus medical
therapy within 24 h of onset, showed clear benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in reducing disability and mortality,
particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms. The risk of intracranial haemorrhage with endovascular
thrombectomy was similar to the risk in anterior circulation stroke. Thrombectomy was beneficial regardless of age,
baseline characteristics, the presence of intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and time from symptom onset to
randomisation. Therefore, the question of whether endovascular thrombectomy is beneficial in basilar artery
occlusion now appears to be settled in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms, and endovascular thrombectomy
should be offered to eligible patients.",1
"Abstract
Importance  Hearing loss has been suggested as a risk factor for dementia, but there is still a need for high-quality research to better understand the association between these 2 conditions and the underlying causal mechanisms and treatment benefits using larger cohorts and detailed data.

Objective  To investigate the association between hearing loss and incident dementia, as well as how hearing aid use contributes to this association.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This population-based cohort study was conducted in Southern Denmark between January 2003 and December 2017 and included all residents 50 years and older. We excluded all persons with dementia before baseline as well as those who did not live in the region 5 years before baseline, with incomplete address history, or who had missing covariate information.

Exposures  Individual hearing status based on the Hearing Examinations in Southern Denmark database, which contains data on all pure-tone audiometry examinations performed at public hearing rehabilitation clinics in Southern Denmark.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Incident cases of dementia and Alzheimer disease as identified from national registries.

Results  The study population comprised 573 088 persons (298 006 women [52%]; mean [SD] age, 60.8 [11.3] years) with 23 023 cases of dementia and mean (SD) follow-up of 8.6 (4.3) years. Having a hearing loss was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.04-1.11) compared with having no hearing loss. Severe hearing loss in the better and worse ear was associated with a higher dementia risk, with an HR of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06-1.20), respectively, compared with having no hearing loss in the corresponding ear. Compared with people without hearing loss, the risk of dementia was higher among people with hearing loss who were not using hearing aids than those who had hearing loss and were using hearing aids, with HRs of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.13-1.27) and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.10), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance  The results of this cohort study suggest that hearing loss was associated with increased dementia risk, especially among people not using hearing aids, suggesting that hearing aids might prevent or delay the onset and progression of dementia. The risk estimates were lower than in previous studies, highlighting the need for more high-quality longitudinal studies.",1
"The detection of phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin domain containing 7A THSD7A among primary membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) patients transformed the diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis. Anti-PLA2R can be detected in 70–90% of primary MGN patients while anti-THSD7A in 2–3% of anti-PLA2R negative primary MGN patients depending on the technique used. Serum and urine samples are less invasive and non-invasive, respectively, and thus can detect the presence of anti-PLA2R and anti-THSD7A with higher sensitivity and specificity, which is significant in patient monitoring and prognosis. It is better than exposing patients to a frequent biopsy, which is an invasive procedure. Different techniques of detection of PLA2R and THSD7A in patients’ urine and sera were reviewed to provide newer and alternative techniques. We proposed the use of biomarkers (PLA2R and THSD7A) in the diagnosis, treatment decision, and follow-up of patients with primary MGN. In addition, other prognostic renal biomarkers like retinol binding protein (RBP) and beta-2 microglobulin were reviewed to detect the progression of renal damage for early intervention.",1
"Abstract
Introduction: HIV-infected individuals on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings who do not achieve the last “90” (viral suppression) enter a complex care cascade: enhanced adherence counselling (EAC), repetition of viral load (VL) and switch to second-line ART aiming to achieve resuppression. This study describes the “failure cascade” in patients in Lesotho.

Methods: Patients aged ≥16 years on first-line ART at 10 facilities in rural Lesotho received a first-time VL in June 2014. Those with VL ≥80 copies/mL were included in a cohort. The care cascade was assessed at four points: attendance of EAC, result of follow-up VL after EAC, switch to second-line in case of sustained unsuppressed VL and outcome 18 months after the initial unsuppressed VL. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of being retained in care with viral resuppression at follow-up.

Results: Out of 1563 patients who underwent first-time VL, 138 (8.8%) had unsuppressed VL in June 2014. Out of these, 124 (90%) attended EAC and 116 (84%) had follow-up VL (4 died, 2 transferred out, 11 lost, 5 switched to second-line before follow-up VL). Among the 116 with follow-up VL, 36 (31%) achieved resuppression. Out of the 80 with sustained unsuppressed VL, 58 were switched to second-line, the remaining continued first line. At 18 months’ follow-up in December 2015, out of the initially 138 with unsuppressed VL, 56 (41%) were in care and virally suppressed, 37 (27%) were in care with unsuppressed VL and the remaining 45 (33%) were lost, dead, transferred to another clinic or without documented VL. Achieving viral resuppression after EAC (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.14–22.09; p = 0.033) and being switched to second-line in case of sustained viremia after EAC (aOR: 7.17; 1.90–27.04; p = 0.004) were associated with being retained in care and virally suppressed at 18 months of follow-up. Age, gender, education, time on ART and level of VL were not associated.

Conclusions: In this study in rural Lesotho, outcomes along the “failure cascade” were poor. To improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient group who fails the last “90”, programmes need to focus on timely EAC and switch to second line for cases with continuous viremia despite EAC.",1
"Abstract
Objective: To determine changes in household purchases of drinks 1 year after implementation of the UK soft drinks industry levy (SDIL).

Design: Controlled interrupted time series.

Participants: Households reporting their purchasing to a market research company (average weekly n=22 091), March 2014 to March 2019.

Intervention: A two-tiered tax levied on soft drinks manufacturers, announced in March 2016 and implemented in April 2018. Drinks with ≥8 g sugar/100 mL (high tier) are taxed at £0.24/L, drinks with ≥5 to <8 g sugar/100 mL (low tier) are taxed at £0.18/L.

Main outcome measures: Absolute and relative differences in the volume of, and amount of sugar in, soft drinks categories, all soft drinks combined, alcohol and confectionery purchased per household per week 1 year after implementation.

Results: In March 2019, compared with the counterfactual, purchased volume of high tier drinks decreased by 140.8 mL (95% CI 104.3 to 177.3 mL) per household per week, equivalent to 37.8% (28.0% to 47.6%), and sugar purchased in these drinks decreased by 16.2 g (13.5 to 18.8 g), or 42.6% (35.6% to 49.6%). Purchases of low tier drinks decreased by 170.5 mL (154.5 to 186.5 mL) or 85.8% (77.8% to 93.9%), with an 11.5 g (9.1 to 13.9 g) reduction in sugar in these drinks, equivalent to 87.8% (69.2% to 106.4%). When all soft drinks were combined irrespective of levy tier or eligibility, the volume of drinks purchased increased by 188.8 mL (30.7 to 346.9 mL) per household per week, or 2.6% (0.4% to 4.7%), but sugar decreased by 8.0 g (2.4 to 13.6 g), or 2.7% (0.8% to 4.5%). Purchases of confectionery and alcoholic drinks did not increase.

Conclusions: Compared with trends before the SDIL was announced, 1 year after implementation, volume of all soft drinks purchased combined increased by 189 mL, or 2.6% per household per week. The amount of sugar in those drinks was 8 g, or 2.7%, lower per household per week. Further studies should determine whether and how apparently small effect sizes translate into health outcomes.",1
"Abstract
Silibinin, a flavonoid derived from the herb milk thistle (Silybum marianum), has been used as a hepato-protectant in the clinical treatment of liver disease. In the present study, the effect of silibinin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory impairment in rats is investigated. Injection of LPS into lateral ventricle caused learning and memory impairment. Rats were treated with silibinin to see the effect in comparison with resveratrol as a positive control. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests showed that silibinin significantly attenuated memory damage caused by LPS treatment. At the molecular analysis, the levels of IL-1β and of IL-4 in the hippocampus were decreased and enhanced, respectively, by the treatment with silibinin. NF-κB expression was attenuated by silibinin treatment. Furthermore, generation of total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hippocampus was elevated in silibinin-treated groups, and so were the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB). At the same time, LPS-induced reduction of neurons in hippocampus was reversed by silibinin. In conclusion, silibinin ameliorated the impairment of learning and memory of LPS-injection rats, possibly due to the activation of ROS–BDNF–TrkB pathway in the hippocampus as well as the suppression of inflammatory response. This study gives an insight on the beneficial consequences of ROS in central nervous system. Silibinin might be a potential candidate drug for neurodegenerative diseases.",1
"Abstract
Sexual violence has increased quite rapidly. Sexual violence can be in the form of physical or verbal violence. The impact of sexual violence causes a traumatic experience that causes physical problems, psychological problems, loss of the future, and causes the risk of death. Nurses have an important role in reducing the impact of sexual violence on victims. The purpose of this study is to describe nursing interventions to reduce the impact of traumatic experiences experienced by victims of sexual violence. This study used a scoping review method. The literature used in this study is from CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus. Keywords in this study are sexual violence, traumatic experience, impact, and victims. Search strategy used PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews to select articles for this study. The inclusion criteria were that the sample was female victims of sexual violence, studies employed a randomized control trial or quasi-experimental research design, and the publication period was of the last 10 years (2013–2022). We found 10 articles that matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The findings from this scoping review show that nursing interventions can reduce the impact of traumatic experiences on victims of sexual violence. There are three methods of nursing intervention, namely cognitive behavior, counseling, and web-based intervention. The samples are from developing and developed countries. The range of the samples are from 35–1250 respondents. Nursing interventions focus on victims in order to improve mental health and reduce the traumatic impact experienced by victims of sexual violence. The activities carried out were psychoeducation, keeping a daily journal, and discussions related to the traumatic experiences experienced. Nurses as health workers have a role to provide comprehensive nursing care to victims of sexual violence by taking into account the characteristics and impact of trauma experienced by victims of sexual violence.

"Abstract
Ipriflavone (IPRI), an isoflavone derivative, is clinically used to prevent postmenopausal bone loss in addition to its antioxidant and cognitive benefits. However, its poor aqueous solubility retained its bioavailability. New strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and solubility of neurological medications to enhance their potency and limit adverse effects. This study aimed to prepare targeted IPRI-poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles coupled with Tet-1 peptide to increase the therapeutic potency of IPRI in a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Streptozotocin (STZ) exacerbates Alzheimer-related alterations by promoting central insulin resistance resulted from defective signaling pathways related to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of STZ was used to introduce the AD model. Icv-STZ injection significantly affected brain insulin, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic indicators and caused behavioral abnormalities. STZ promoted the formation of amyloid β42 (Aβ42) by increasing BACE1 and reducing ADAM10 and ADAM17 expression levels. STZ also triggered the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction, which are crucial for neurological impairments. Icv-STZ injection showed evident degenerative changes in the pyramidal cell layer and significantly reduced the count of viable cells in both CA1 and prefrontal cortex, indicating increased neuronal cell death. IPRI successfully ameliorated cognitive dysfunction by improving the phosphorylated forms of cAMP-response element-binding protein (pCREB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) related to synaptic plasticity. Targeted IPRI nanoparticles exceeded free IPRI potential in reducing oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase/monoamine oxidase activities, Tau phosphorylation, and Aβ42 levels revealing less degenerative changes and increased viable neuron counts. IPRI-targeted nanoparticles improved the neuroprotective potential of free IPRI, making this strategy applicable to treat many neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the in silico study predicted its ability to cross the BBB and to bind various protein targets in the brain.",1
"This present research work reports the comparative analysis of the entire nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial genomes of Serranochromis robustus and Buccochromis nototaenia and phylogenetic analyses of their protein-coding genes in order to establish their phylogenetic relationship within Cichlids. The mitochondrial genomes of S. robustus and B. nototaenia are 16,583 and 16,580 base pairs long, respectively, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one control region (D-loop) which is 888 and 887 base pairs long, respectively, showing the same gene order and identical number of gene or regions with other well-elucidated mitogenomes of Cichlids. However, with exception of cytochrome-c oxidase subunit-1 (COX-1) gene, all the identified PCGs were initiated by ATG-codons. Structurally, 11 tRNA genes in B. nototaenia species and 9 tRNA genes in S. robustus species, folded into typical clover-leaf secondary structure created by the regions of self-complementarity within tRNA. All the 22 tRNA genes in both species lack variable loop. Moreover, 28 genes which include 12-protein-coding genes are encoded on the H-strand and the remaining 9 genes including one protein-coding gene are encoded on the L-strand. Thirteen sequences of concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding genes were aligned using MUSCLE, and the phylogenetic analyses performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference showed that S. robustus and B. nototaenia had a broad phylogenetic relationship. These results may be a useful tool in resolving higher-level relationships in organisms and a useful dataset for studying the evolution of the Cichlidae mitochondrial genome, since Cichlids are well-known model species in the study of evolutionary biology, because of their extreme morphological, biogeographical, parental care behavior for eggs and larvae and phylogenetic diversities.",1
"Abstract
Human serum amyloid A (SAA) has been demonstrated as a chemoattractant and proinflammatory mediator of lethal systemic inflammatory diseases. In the circulation, it can be sequestered by a high-density lipoprotein, HDL, which carries cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and apolipoproteins (Apo-AI). The capture of SAA by HDL results in the displacement of Apo-AI, and the consequent inhibition of SAA's chemoattractant activities. It was previously unknown whether HDL similarly inhibits SAA-induced sPLA2 expression, as well as the resultant HMGB1 release, nitric oxide (NO) production and autophagy activation. Here we provided compelling evidence that human SAA effectively upregulated the expression and secretion of both sPLA2-IIE and sPLA2-V in murine macrophages, which were attenuated by HDL in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, HDL dose-dependently suppressed SAA-induced HMGB1 release, NO production, and autophagy activation. In both RAW 264.7 cells and primary macrophages, HDL inhibited SAA-induced secretion of several cytokines (e.g., IL-6) and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1 and RANTES) that were likely dependent on functional TLR4 signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that HDL counter-regulates SAA-induced upregulation and secretion of sPLA2-IIE/V in addition to other TLR4-dependent cytokines and chemokines in macrophage cultures.",1
"Abstract
A simple isothermal nucleic-acid amplification reaction, primer generation–rolling circle amplification (PG–RCA), was developed to detect specific nucleic-acid sequences of sample DNA. This amplification method is achievable at a constant temperature (e.g. 60°C) simply by mixing circular single-stranded DNA probe, DNA polymerase and nicking enzyme. Unlike conventional nucleic-acid amplification reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), this reaction does not require exogenous primers, which often cause primer dimerization or non-specific amplification. Instead, ‘primers’ are generated and accumulated during the reaction. The circular probe carries only two sequences: (i) a hybridization sequence to the sample DNA and (ii) a recognition sequence of the nicking enzyme. In PG–RCA, the circular probe first hybridizes with the sample DNA, and then a cascade reaction of linear rolling circle amplification and nicking reactions takes place. In contrast with conventional linear rolling circle amplification, the signal amplification is in an exponential mode since many copies of ‘primers’ are successively produced by multiple nicking reactions. Under the optimized condition, we obtained a remarkable sensitivity of 84.5 ymol (50.7 molecules) of synthetic sample DNA and 0.163 pg (∼60 molecules) of genomic DNA from Listeria monocytogenes, indicating strong applicability of PG–RCA to various molecular diagnostic assays.",1
"Abstract
8 Gastric ulcer is a very common disease that represent an economic burden. Non-steroidal
9 anti-inflammatory drugs induce ulcer in old patients and in patients with comorbidities.
10 Indomethacin is widely used to induce gastric ulcer in animal models. Diabetic patients are
11 highly susceptible to develop gastric ulcer. Metformin, the first line medication for the treatment
12 of type II diabetes melilites that have many off label uses in non-diabetic patients, has been
13 recently reported to have anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, this research was conducted to
14 assess the possible healing effects of metformin on gastric ulcers induced by indomethacin in
15 rats. Indomethacin (48 mg/kg) single dose increased stomach acidity, ulcer index and induced
16 histopathological changes. Indomethacin also decreased mucin levels and increased the activity
17 of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), Rho-associated protein
18 kinas-1 (ROCK-1) and decreased the levels of the protective nitric oxide (NO). After the
19 induction of ulcer, rats were treated by omeprazole (30 mg/kg) or metformin (50, 100 or 200
20 mg/kg). Omeprazole and metformin were found to decrease stomach acidity and ulcer index,
21 restored the histological features and increased mucin levels. Both also decreased the levels of
22 NF-κB, TNF-α, ROCK-1 and increased NO. Metformin exerted ulcer healing effects comparable to that of omeprazole. This can be attributed, at least partly, to its anti-inflammatory activity and
24 increasing NO levels. ",1
"Abstract
Background
We retrospectively analysed the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma with renal impairment.

Methods
Patients were divided into two groups by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) cut-off of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Background factors considered to affect prognosis were well balanced by propensity score matching between the groups. Demographics, dose modification, adverse events, tumour response, progression-free survival, and renal function (eGFR) were evaluated.

Results
Among 935 and 2008 patients with an eGFR of <45 and ≥45, respectively, 613 pairs were matched. The mean starting dose was significantly lower in patients with an eGFR of <45; however, the mean daily dose, median treatment duration, progression-free survival, and tumour response were similar between the groups. In terms of safety, no significant differences were found in serious adverse events, although cytopaenia (16.6% vs 10.6%) and renal dysfunction (4.4% vs 0.7%) were higher in patients with an eGFR of <45 than ≥45 in all adverse events. There were also no differences in dose modification, including dose reduction, dose interruption, and treatment discontinuation.

Conclusion
Throughout the 12-month observation period, sorafenib in patients with an eGFR of <45 and ≥45 showed similar safety and efficacy, and treatment was continued without affecting renal function.",1
"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a cell surface receptor for
high density lipoproteins. It also binds oxidized low density lipoproteins and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPL), which adversely affect bone homeostasis. Overexpression of a single chain form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 IgM–a
natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPL–increases trabecular and cortical bone mass in
female and male mice by stimulating bone formation. We have previously reported that
Scarb1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for PC-OxPL in calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells. Additionally, bone marrow- and calvaria-derived osteoblasts from Scarb1
knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating
effects of OxPL. Previous skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice has produced contradictory
results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass but another study reporting low
bone mass. To clarify the role of Scarb1 in osteoblasts, we deleted Scarb1 specifically in
cells of the osteoblast lineage using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. We observed no difference
in bone mineral density measured by DXA in either female or male Osx1-Cre;Scarb1fl/fl
mice compared to wild type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. Additionally,
microCT analysis of 6-month-old females and 7-month-old males did not detect any difference in trabecular or cortical bone mass between genotypes. These results indicate that
expression of Scarb1 in cells of the osteoblast lineage does not play an important role in
bone homeostasis and, therefore, it is not essential for the effects of PC-OxPL on these
cells",1
"Oxidized phospholipids containing phosphocholine (OxPL) are pro-inflammatory lipid peroxidation products that bind to scavenger receptors (SRs), such as Scarb1, and toll-like receptors (TLRs). Excessive OxPL, as found in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL), overwhelm these defense mechanisms and become pathogenic in atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and osteoporosis. We previously reported that the innate IgM natural antibody E06 binds to OxPL and neutralizes their deleterious effects; expression of the single-chain (scFv) form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 (E06-scFv) as a transgene increases trabecular bone in male mice. We show herein that E06-scFv increases trabecular and cortical bone in female and male mice by increasing bone formation and decreasing osteoblast apoptosis in vivo. Homozygous E06-scFv mice have higher bone mass than hemizygous, showing a dose effect of the transgene. To investigate how OxPL restrain bone formation under physiologic conditions, we measured the levels of SRs and TLRs that bind OxPL. We found that osteoblastic cells primarily express Scarb1. Moreover, OxLDL-induced apoptosis and reduced differentiation were prevented in bone marrow-derived or calvaria-derived osteoblasts from Scarb1 knockout mice. Because Scarb1-deficient mice are reported to have high bone mass, our results suggest that E06 may promote bone anabolism in healthy young mice, at least in part, by neutralizing OxPL, which in turn promote Scarb1-mediated apoptosis of osteoblasts or osteoblast precursors. © 2020 The Authors.

"Abstract
The DEEP cohort is the first population-based cohort of pregnant population in China that longitudinally documented drug uses throughout the pregnancy life course and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The main goal of the study aims to monitor and evaluate the safety of drug use through the pregnancy life course in the Chinese setting. The DEEP cohort is developed primarily based on the population-based data platforms in Xiamen, a municipal city of 5 million population in southeast China. Based on these data platforms, we developed a pregnancy database that documented health care services and outcomes in the maternal and other departments. For identifying drug uses, we developed a drug prescription database using electronic healthcare records documented in the platforms across the primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals. By linking these two databases, we developed the DEEP cohort. All the pregnant women and their offspring in Xiamen are provided with health care and followed up according to standard protocols, and the primary adverse outcomes – congenital malformations – are collected using a standardized Case Report Form. From January 2013 to December 2021, the DEEP cohort included 564,740 pregnancies among 470,137 mothers, and documented 526,276 live births, 14,090 miscarriages and 6,058 fetal deaths/stillbirths and 25,723 continuing pregnancies. In total, 13,284,982 prescriptions were documented, in which 2,096 chemicals drugs, 163 biological products, 847 Chinese patent medicines and 655 herbal medicines were prescribed. The overall incidence rate of congenital malformations was 2.0% (10,444/526,276), while there were 25,526 (4.9%) preterm births and 25,605 (4.9%) live births with low birth weight.",1
"Abstract
Aims/hypothesis: Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of
glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to
stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all
islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human
islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling,
while preserving biological heterogeneity.
Methods: We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8
mM glucose; (2) 25 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and
(3) 25 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium
signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted
the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or
PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed
calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of
alpha and beta cells.
Results: Based on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta
cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal
cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this
cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest
number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7
protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function.
Conclusions: Here we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-typespecific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In
our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of
calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

"Summary
Introduction. For acute appendicitis - the most frequent condition to perform an urgent abdominal operation in pediatric surgery -
surgical appendectomy still remains the gold standard regarding treatment, nevertheless nonsurgical management has become more
and more recognized as a treatment method for uncomplicated acute appendicitis (UAA). However there are still many unanswered
questions regarding possible factors that could predict the treatment outcome as well as appropriate antimicrobial drug regimens.
Aim of the Study. The aim was to investigate if there is a possible association between factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP)
level, presence of appendicolith, the diameter of the appendix and treatment outcome; as well as to identify most successfully used
antimicrobial drug combinations.
Material and methods. A retrospective analysis of hospital cases, admitted to a single reference center during the time period from
2013 to 2015. Patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis, elevated inflammatory markers and radiological findings suggestive
for acute appendicitis were included in the study. Nonsurgical treated patients were divided in two groups based on the treatment
outcome - successful or unsuccessful. Analysis of the three factors (CRP level, presence of appendicolith and the diameter of the
appendix) and most commonly used antimicrobial drug regimen association with treatment outcome was performed.
Results. Overall 384 children medical records with acute appendicitis were registered and non-surgical treatment was initiated in
147/384 (38 %) cases. Successful treatment outcome of nonsurgical management was identified in 114/147 (78 %) cases.
Analyzing prognostic adverse factors results presents no statistically significant difference in association with CRP level >25 mg/l
(p=0,479), presence of appendicolith (p=0,183) and the diameter of appendix >1 cm (p=0,183) with successful or unsuccessful
treatment outcome. The two most commonly used antimicrobial drug combinations were - Ampicillin/Metronidazole for 49 patients
and Ampicillin/Gentamicin for 44 patients. No relevance with treatment outcome and used antimicrobial agents was detected
(p=0,597).
The overall recurrence rate after initial presentation is 15 % (17/114). In 3 cases (3 %) recurrent appendicitis developed one month
after discharge and in 14 cases (12 %) up to one year after discharge.
Conclusions. Prognostic adverse factors - CRP, presence of appendicolith and diameter of appendix - were not statistically reliable
in association with initial non-surgical treatment outcome.
The success rate of conservative treatment with narrow spectrum antibiotics was 78 %, which is just as high as in cases treated
conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics from previous studies.
Therefore the question of which factors and antimicrobial drug combinations influence the course of treatment still remains
unanswered and further studies are required.
Key words: uncomplicated acute appendicitis, nonsurgical management, antimicrobial regimens, adverse prognostic factors",1
"Abstract
Motivation: CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been revolutionizing the field of gene editing. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) enable Cas9 proteins to target
specific genomic loci for editing. However, editing efficiency varies between gRNAs and so computational methods were developed to predict
editing efficiency for any gRNA of interest. High-throughput datasets of Cas9 editing efficiencies were produced to train machine-learning models to predict editing efficiency. However, these high-throughput datasets have a low correlation with functional and endogenous datasets,
which are too small to train accurate machine-learning models on.
Results: We developed DeepCRISTL, a deep-learning model to predict the editing efficiency in a specific cellular context. DeepCRISTL takes
advantage of high-throughput datasets to learn general patterns of gRNA editing efficiency and then fine-tunes the model on functional or endogenous data to fit a specific cellular context. We tested two state-of-the-art models trained on high-throughput datasets for editing efficiency prediction, our newly improved DeepHF and CRISPRon, combined with various transfer-learning approaches. The combination of CRISPRon and finetuning all model weights was the overall best performer. DeepCRISTL outperformed state-of-the-art methods in predicting editing efficiency in a
specific cellular context on functional and endogenous datasets. Using saliency maps, we identified and compared the important features learned
by DeepCRISTL across cellular contexts. We believe DeepCRISTL will improve prediction performance in many other CRISPR/Cas9 editing contexts by leveraging transfer learning to utilize both high-throughput datasets and smaller and more biologically relevant datasets.

"Abstract
The ability to generate germ cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is valuable for human regenerative medicine and animal breeding. Germ cell-like cells (GCLCs) have been differentiated from mouse and human PSCs, but not from porcine PSCs, which are considered an ideal model for stem cell applications. Here, we developed a defined culture system for the induction of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) from porcine induced PSCs (piPSCs). The identity of the PGCLCs was characterized by observing cell morphology, detecting germ cell marker gene expression and evaluating epigenetic properties. PGCLCs could further differentiate into spermatogonial stem cell-like cells (SSCLCs) in vitro. Importantly, meiosis occurred during SSCLC induction. Xenotransplantation of GCLCs into seminiferous tubules of infertile immunodeficient mice resulted in immunohistochemically identifiable germ cells in vivo. Overall, our study provides a feasible strategy for directing piPSCs to the germ cell fate and lays a foundation for exploring germ cell development mechanisms.",1
"ABSTRACT
Diagnostic investigations of aneurysm, hemorrhagic stroke, and other asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders due to the
flow choking (biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking) phenomenon in the circulatory system of humans and animals on the
Earth and in the human spaceflight are active research topics of topical interest {Kumar et al., “boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking
leads to hemorrhagic stroke and other neurological disorders in earth and human spaceflight,” Paper presented at the Basic Cardiovascular
Sciences Conference, 23–25 August 2021 (American Stroke Association, 2021) [Circ. Res. 129, AP422 (2021)] and “Lopsided blood-thinning drug
increases the risk of internal flow choking and shock wave generation causing asymptomatic stroke,” in International Stroke Conference, 19–20
March 2021 (American Stroke Association, 2021) [Stroke 52, AP804 (2021)]}. The theoretical concept of flow choking [Kumar et al., “Lopsided
blood-thinning drug increases the risk of internal flow choking leading to shock wave generation causing asymptomatic cardiovascular disease,”

prediction of the 3D boundary-layer-blockage factor in nanotubes,” Sci. Rep. 11, 15429 (2021); and “The theoretical prediction of the boundary
layer blockage and external flow choking at moving aircraft in ground effects,” Phys. Fluids 33(3), 036108 (2021)] in the cardiovascular system
(CVS) due to gas embolism is established herein through analytical, in vitro (Kumar et al., “Nanoscale flow choking and spaceflight effects on
cardiovascular risk of astronauts—A new perspective,” AIAA Paper No. 2021-0357, 2021), in silico (Kumar et al., “Boundary layer blockage,
Venturi effect and cavitation causing aerodynamic choking and shock waves in human artery leading to hemorrhage and massive heart attack—A
new perspective,” AIAA Paper No. 2018-3962, 2018), and in vivo animal methodology [Jayaraman et al., “Animal in vivo: The proof of flow
choking and bulging of the downstream region of the stenosis artery due to air embolism,” Paper presented at the Basic Cardiovascular Sciences
Conference, 25–28 July 2022 (American Heart Association, 2022)]. The boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking phenomenon is a
compressible viscous flow effect, and it arises at a critical pressure ratio in continuum/non-continuum real-world yocto to yotta scale flow systems
and beyond [Kumar et al., “Universal benchmark data of the three-dimensional boundary layer blockage and average friction coefficient for in

silico code verification,” Phys. Fluids 34(4), 041301 (2022)]. The closed-form analytical models, capable of predicting the flow choking in CVS,
developed from the well-established compressible viscous flow theory are reviewed and presented herein. The lower-critical flow-choking
index of the healthy subject (human being/animal) is predicted through the speciation analysis of blood. The upper-critical flow-choking index
is predicted from the specific heat of blood at constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv), estimated using the Differential Scanning
Calorimeter. These flow-choking indexes, highlighted in terms of systolic-to-diastolic blood pressure ratio (SBP/DBP), are exclusively controlled
by the biofluid/blood heat capacity ratio (BHCR ¼ Cp/Cv). An in vitro study shows that nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2)
gases are predominant in fresh-blood samples of the healthy humans and Guinea pigs at a temperature range of 37–40 C (98.6–104 F) causing
gas embolism. In silico results demonstrated the existence of the biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking, stream tube flow
choking, shock wave generation, and pressure overshoot in the downstream region of simulated arteries (with and without stenosis), at a critical
pressure ratio, due to gas embolism. The flow choking followed by aneurysm (i.e., bulging of the downstream region of the stenosis artery due to
shock wave generation) due to air embolism is demonstrated through small animal in vivo studies. We could corroborate herein, with the animal
in vivo and three-dimensional in silico studies, that flow-choking followed by shock wave generation and pressure overshoot occurs in arteries
with stenosis due to air embolism at a critical pressure ratio. Analytical models reveal that flow-choking occurs at relatively high and low blood
viscosities in CVS at a critical blood pressure ratio (BPR), which leads to memory effect (stroke history/arterial stiffness) and asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases [Kumar et al., “Lopsided blood-thinning drug increases the risk of internal flow choking leading to shock wave generation
causing asymptomatic cardiovascular disease,” Global Challenges 5, 2000076 (2021)]. We concluded that an overdose of drug for reducing the
blood viscosity enhances the risk of flow choking (biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking) due to an enhanced boundary
layer blockage (BLB) factor because of the rise in Reynolds number (Re) and turbulence. An analytical model establishes that an increase in Re
due to the individual or the joint effects of fluid density, fluid viscosity, fluid velocity, and the hydraulic diameter of the vessel creates high turbulence level in CVS instigating an escalated BLB factor heading to a rapid adverse flow choking. Therefore, prescribing the exact bloodthinning course of therapy is crucial for achieving the anticipated curative value and further annulling adverse flow choking (biofluid/boundary
layer blockage persuaded flow choking) in CVS. We could conclude authoritatively herein, with the animal in vivo studies, that flow choking
occurs in the artery with stenosis due to air embolism at a critical BPR (i.e., SBP/DBP ¼ 1.892 9), which is regulated by the heat capacity ratio of
air. The cardiovascular risk due to boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking could be diminished by concurrently reducing the viscosity
of biofluid/blood and flow-turbulence. This comprehensive review is a pointer toward achieving relentless unchoked flow conditions (i.e., flow
Mach number< 1) in the CVS for prohibiting asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders associated with flow choking
and shock wave generation followed by pressure overshoot causing arterial stiffness. The unchoked flow condition can be achieved in every subject (human/animal) by suitably increasing the thermal-tolerance-level in terms of BHCR and/or by reducing the BPR within the pathophysiological range of individual subjects through the new drug discovery, the new companion drug with the conventional blood thinners and/or
proper health care management for increasing the healthy-life span of one and all in the universe.",1
"Abstract
Objectives: Possible association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been controversial. This study used a nationwide population-based dataset to investigate the relationship between DM and subsequent AD incidence.

Methods: Data were collected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which released a cohort dataset of 1,000,000 randomly sampled people and confirmed it to be representative of the Taiwanese population. We identified 71,433 patients newly diagnosed with diabetes (age 58.74 ± 14.02 years) since January 1997. Using propensity score, we matched them with 71,311 non-diabetic subjects by time of enrollment, age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous stroke history. All the patients were followed up to December 31, 2007. The endpoint of the study was occurrence of AD.

Results: Over a maximum 11 years of follow-up, diabetic patients experienced a higher incidence of AD than non-diabetic subjects (0.48% vs. 0.37%, p<0.001). After Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis, DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.07, p<0.001), age (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.12, p<0.001), female gender (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46, p=0.008), hypertension (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.59, p=0.01), previous stroke history (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.28-2.50, p<0.001), and urbanization status (metropolis, HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.63, p=0.009) were independently associated with the increased risk of AD. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy with oral antidiabetic medications were associated with the risk of AD after adjusting for underlying risk factors and the duration of DM since diagnosis. However, combination therapy with insulin was found to be associated with greater risk of AD (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.04-4.52, p=0.039).

Conclusion: Newly diagnosed DM was associated with increased risk of AD. Use of hypoglycemic agents did not ameliorate the risk.",1

Background
The influence of previous syphilis on the course of a subsequent episode is unknown.

Methods
Individuals enrolled in a study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities in syphilis were allowed to enroll in the study again with subsequent syphilis. For each participant, the index episode was defined as the most recent syphilis episode for which the study entry visit was performed within 30 days of the syphilis diagnosis date. Venipuncture and lumbar puncture (LP) were performed. Total number of syphilis episodes was determined by review of medical and public health records. T. pallidum DNA in blood and rRNA in CSF were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase PCR. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined by logistic regression.

Results
651 individuals had one (n = 482), two (n = 121) or three or more (n = 48) episodes of syphilis. The proportion of individuals whose index episode was early latent stage was significantly higher in those with ≥3 syphilis episodes; this relationship was reduced to a trend when rate of testing was taken into account. Adjusted odds (aOR) of detection of T. pallidum DNA in blood or rRNA in CSF at the index episode were significantly lower in those with previous syphilis (0.17 [95% CI, 0.09–0.31] and 0.15 [95% CI, 0.07–0.35]). The aOR for neurosyphilis at the index episode was also significantly lower in individuals with previous syphilis (0.54 [95% CI, 0.34–0.87]).

Conclusions
Previous syphilis attenuates the manifestations of subsequent infection with T. pallidum.",1
"The Cmax and AUC of rosuvastatin increase when it is coadministered with telmisartan. The aim of this study was to explore which of the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of rosuvastatin are changed by telmisartan to cause such an interaction. We used data from drug–drug interaction (DDI) studies of 74 healthy volunteers performed in three different institutions. Rosuvastatin population PK models with or without telmisartan were developed using NONMEM (version 7.3). The plasma concentration–time profile of rosuvastatin was best described by a two-compartment, first-order elimination model with simultaneous Erlang and zero-order absorption when given rosuvastatin alone. When telmisartan was coadministered, the zero-order absorption fraction of rosuvastatin had to be omitted from the model because the absorption was dramatically accelerated. Notwithstanding the accelerated absorption, the relative bioavailability (BA) parameter estimate in the model demonstrated that the telmisartan-induced increase in BA was only about 20% and the clearance was not influenced by telmisartan at all in the final PK model. Thus, our model implies that telmisartan may influence the absorption process of rosuvastatin rather than its metabolic elimination. This may be used as a clue for further physiologically based PK (PBPK) approaches to investigate the mechanism of rosuvastatin–telmisartan DDI.",1

Purpose
Mental health conditions may affect outcome of COVID-19 disease, while exposure to stressors during the pandemic may impact mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine these factors in relation to ocurrence of depression and anxiety after the first outbreak in Spain.

Methods
We contacted 9515 participants from a population-based cohort study in Catalonia between May and October 2020. We drew blood samples to establish infection to the virus. Pre-pandemic mental health conditions were confirmed through Electronic Health Registries. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess severe depression and anxiety post-pandemic. Exposure to proximal, financial and wider environment stressors during the lockdown were collected. We calculated Relative Risks (RR), adjusting for individual- and contextual covariates.

Results
Pre-pandemic mental health disorders were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection , but were associated with severity of COVID-19 disease. People with pre-existing mental health disorders showed higher prevalence of severe depression (25.4%) and anxiety (37.8%) than those without prior mental disorders (4.9% and 10.1%). Living alone was a strong predictor of severe depression among mental health patients (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.2). Among those without prior mental health disorders, post-lockdown depression and anxiety were associated with household interpersonal conflicts (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 2.1–3.1; RR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.9–2.4) and financial instability (RR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.8–2.9; 1.9, 95% CI 1.6–2.2).

Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown were associated with increased post-lockdown depression and anxiety. Patients with pre-existing mental health conditions are a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19 disease.",1

Energy storage, as a schedulable resource, can be added to the optimal scheduling model of microgrids, which can effectively improve the penetration rate of renewable energy in the grid and improve the reliability and economy of the system. Aiming at grid-connected microgrids, including wind power, photovoltaic, energy storage devices, and micro gas turbines, this paper takes the lowest comprehensive operating cost as the objective function. It takes power balance, distributed power output characteristics, energy storage battery power, and tie line constraints as constraints to establish the optimal configuration model of the microgrid. The Tent chaotic mapping and Cauchy mutation operator method improve the traditional algorithms of the grey wolf, such as the last use of an improved algorithm to solve the model; the simulation results show that the improved grey wolf algorithm has good optimization ability, this model can realize economy optimal micro power grid, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified.",1
"Objective: The devices to be used in clinical practice
should be tested for accuracy and should be validated
through the validation protocol. The aim of this study
was to determine the accuracy of the Meditech-ABPM-06
ambulatory blood pressure monitor.
Materials and methods: The test was carried out in
accordance with the protocol established by the European
Society of Hypertension (ESH-IP), the British Hypertension
Society, and the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2-2013 protocols.
Results: In the European Society of Hypertension
validation procedure the subjects with two or three
of the absolute differences between observer and
device SBP/DBP measurements within 5 mmHg were
31/31. The average device-observer difference was
−0.4 ± 3.9 mmHg for SBP and −0.4 ± 2.8 mmHg for DBP.
In the British Hypertension Society validation procedure
the mean differences of the test device and observer
readings were −1.0 ± 4.6 (systolic) and −1.1 ± 4.5
(diastolic). In the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2-2013
validation procedure (criterion 1) the mean ± SD of the
differences between the test device and reference BP was
−0.5 ± 4.0/−0.3 ± 4.5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). The two
criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO were fulfilled.
Conclusion: The Meditech ABPM-06 blood pressure
measure device met the requirements specified by the
British Hypertension Society, the European Society of
Hypertension International Protocol and the AAMI, and
therefore was considered acceptable to clinical use with a
Grade of A/A. Blood Press Monit 24:208–211 Copyright ©

"Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been related with improved job satisfaction, wellbeing,
health, and reduced workplace stress with employees. However, until now, synthesis of the evidence of the effect
of MBIs on physiological indices associated with stress and ill-health has been lacking. Therefore the current
systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature from employee samples to provide guidance for future
investigations in terms of which physiological indicators and biological systems may be most impacted by MBIs.
Methods: Electronic databases were searched. Studies that conducted a mindfulness-based program with an
employee sample, which targeted workplace stress or work engagement, and measured a physiological outcome
were selected for inclusion. Studies using either a between-group or within-group design were included. Nine
papers were found to meet the inclusion criteria for our systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.
Results: MBIs were found to be effective in reducing cortisol production, as indicated by lowered high and low
diurnal cortisol slopes. However, no changes were found for cortisol awakening response or concentrations for
single a.m. and p.m. time-points. MBIs also improved autonomic balance, assessed by heart rate variability
coherence measures, but not blood pressure. Sympathetic nervous system reactivity as measured by salivary
alpha amylase was also reduced following MBI. While aspects of immune function were also improved following
MBIs, specifically, increased antibody response to a viral vaccine and reduced C-reactive protein concentrations,
each of these outcomes were only assessed in a single study.
Conclusion: Taken together, the findings suggest that MBIs are a promising avenue for intervention for improving physiological indices of stress. Our findings suggest that changes in daytime cortisol secretion and HRV
coherence may be particularly influenced by MBIs. Future studies should aim to assess multiple physiological
indices to confirm the current findings and further improve current understanding of which biological systems
(and indices within these systems) show responses indicative of reduced stress due to MBI.",1
"Purpose
To examine the Level of Evidence and overall quality of studies addressing arthroscopic posterolateral corner reconstructions of the knee.
Methods
A search was performed using the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for all studies investigating arthroscopic treatment of posterolateral corner injuries of the knee. Studies reporting outcomes or describing arthroscopic techniques for treatment of posterolateral corner injuries of the knee were the focus of this analysis. Clinical as well as biomechanical and cadaveric studies were included. Studies only investigating open techniques were excluded. Two independent reviewers determined the level of evidence for each included study using the criteria established by the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and scored each clinical study from 0 to 100 based on 10 criteria from the modified Coleman Methodology Score.
Results
Twenty-four studies matched the inclusion criteria. There were 6 cadaveric technique descriptions, 6 clinical technique descriptions, 3 biomechanical studies, 4 technical repair descriptions, and 5 clinical outcome studies. Thirty-eight percent of all studies were of Level V evidence. Fifty percent of studies were of Level IV evidence, and 12% of studies were of Level III evidence. The mean modified Coleman Methodology Score for the clinical studies was 43 ± 11.4, which is regarded as poor, mainly due to the limited number of patients and the retrospective nature of the studies.
Conclusions
Most studies addressing arthroscopic posterolateral corner reconstruction of the knee are of low level of evidence and provide limited information about the best treatment options.",1
"Abstract
Propofol is the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic worldwide. It can induce loss of consciousness prior to the occurrence of severe respiratory suppression, which is also a pharmacodynamic feature of all general anesthetics. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this natural phenomenon are controversial and highly related to patient safety. In the present study, we demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic effects of propofol (50 and 100 μM) on suppression of consciousness-related excitatory postsynaptic currents in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) were lower than those in the kernel respiratory rhythmogenesis nucleus pre-Bötzinger complex (PrBo). Furthermore, we unexpectedly found that the GABAA receptor β3 subunit is the key target for propofol’s action and that it is mutually and exclusively expressed in GABAergic neurons. It is also more abundant in the mPFC and CMT, but mainly co-localized with GABAergic neurons in the PrBo. As a result, the differentiated expression pattern should mediate more neuron suppression through the activation of GABAergic neurons in the mPFC and CMT at low doses of propofol (50 μM). However, PrBo GABAergic neurons were only activated by propofol at a high dose (100 μM). These results highlight the detailed pharmacodynamic effects of propofol on consciousness-related and respiration-related nuclei and provide the distinct interaction mechanism between the β3 subunit and GABAergic neurons in mediating the suppression of consciousness compared to the inhibition of respiration.",1
"Abstract
The aims of this systematic review were to study the analgesic effect of real acupuncture and to explore whether sham acupuncture (SA) type is related to the estimated effect of real acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain. Five databases were searched. The outcome was pain or disability immediately (≤1 week) following an intervention. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Meta-regression was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. Sixty-three studies (6382 individuals) were included. Eight condition types were included. The pooled effect size was moderate for pain relief (59 trials, 4980 individuals, SMD −0.61, 95% CI −0.76 to −0.47; P < 0.001) and large for disability improvement (31 trials, 4876 individuals, −0.77, −1.05 to −0.49; P < 0.001). In a univariate meta-regression model, sham needle location and/or depth could explain most or all heterogeneities for some conditions (e.g., shoulder pain, low back pain, osteoarthritis, myofascial pain and fibromyalgia); however, the interactions between subgroups via these covariates were not significant (P < 0.05). Our review provided low-quality evidence that real acupuncture has a moderate effect (approximate 12-point reduction on the 100-mm visual analogue scale) on musculoskeletal pain. SA type did not appear to be related to the estimated effect of real acupuncture.",1
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
was to figure out the effect of microRNA-217 on
the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cells, and to explore its influence on KLF5
expression and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
was used to detect the expression of microRNA-217 in tumor tissues and paracancerous tissues of 60 patients with HCC. Meanwhile, the relationship between microRNA-217 expression
and HCC pathological parameters was analyzed.
In HCC cell lines including HepG2 and Bel-7402,
negative control group (NC) and microRNA-217
overexpression group were set up, and qRT-PCR
was performed to further verify their transfection efficiency. In addition, Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay
were performed to analyze the effect of microRNA-217 on the biological function of HCC cells.
Finally, the potential mechanism of KLF5, the
downstream gene of microRNA-217, was explored using bioinformatics analysis and cell recovery experiments.
RESULTS: QRT-PCR results showed that microRNA-217 level in tumor tissues of HCC patients was conspicuously lower than that in
adjacent tissues, and the difference was statistically significant. Compared with patients with
high expression of microRNA-217, the pathological stage was higher and the overall survival
rate was lower in patients with low expression.
Compared with the NC group, the cell proliferation ability of the microRNA-217 mimics group
was conspicuously decreased. Subsequently,
in the HCC cell line and tissue verification, the
expression of KLF5 was found remarkably increased, and microRNA-217 exhibited a negative correlation with KLF5 level. In addition, the
overexpression of microRNA-217 conspicuously
reduced the protein expression of CD31, Ki-67,
c-Myc, MMP-2, and MMP-9. In cell recovery experiment, it was found that the overexpression
of KLF5 could counteract the effect of microRNA-217 mimics on the cell proliferation of HCC,
thereby inhibiting the malignant progression of
this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The above studies demonstrated that microRNA-217 was markedly associated with the pathological stage and poor
prognosis of HCC, and could inhibit the malignant progression of this disease. In addition, our
investigation has showed that microRNA-217
might be capable of inhibiting cell proliferation
of HCC via regulating KLF5.",1
"Abstract
Background:
Facial expressions require the complex coordination of 43 different facial muscles. Parkinson disease (PD) affects facial musculature leading to “hypomimia” or “masked facies.”

Objective:
We aimed to determine whether modern computer vision techniques can be applied to detect masked facies and quantify drug states in PD.

Methods:
We trained a convolutional neural network on images extracted from videos of 107 self-identified people with PD, along with 1595 videos of controls, in order to detect PD hypomimia cues. This trained model was applied to clinical interviews of 35 PD patients in their on and off drug motor states, and seven journalist interviews of the actor Alan Alda obtained before and after he was diagnosed with PD.

Results:
The algorithm achieved a test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 on 54 subjects to detect PD hypomimia, compared to a value of 0.75 for trained neurologists using the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-III Facial Expression score. Additionally, the model accuracy to classify the on and off drug states in the clinical samples was 63% (22/35), in contrast to an accuracy of 46% (16/35) when using clinical rater scores. Finally, each of Alan Alda’s seven interviews were successfully classified as occurring before (versus after) his diagnosis, with 100% accuracy (7/7).

Conclusions:
This proof-of-principle pilot study demonstrated that computer vision holds promise as a valuable tool for PD hypomimia and for monitoring a patient’s motor state in an objective and noninvasive way, particularly given the increasing importance of telemedicine.",1
"Abstract
Introduction: 
Appendiceal stump closure (ASC) is a key step in performing laparoscopic appendicectomy. Currently, there is no gold standard method to achieve this goal. The ideal method should be safe, easily available, and have a short learning curve. Out of all those appendiceal stump closure methods, the use of hem-o-Lok demonstrates its feasibility in replacing the traditionally used endoloop. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors aim to review the currently available evidence addressing the topic of interest.

Method: 
The PubMed and Embase databases were searched with the paired search terms appendicitis, clip, and endoloop by two authors separately. The quality of the randomized controlled trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the quality of the observational studies was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis was conducted with Cochrane Review Manager version 5.4.

Result: 
Eighteen studies were included for quantitative analysis. The appendiceal stump closure time was shortened by 2 min 7 s using a hem-o-lok with 95% CI 1 min 48 s–2 min 26 s, p less than 0.00001. The pooled results of 6 randomized controlled trials demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in operative time of 5.15 min from adopting the hem-o-lok approach (p=0.001, 95% CI −2.05 to −8.24 min). Both endoloop and hem-o-lok demonstrated a comparable postoperative hospital stay and infective complication profile.

Conclusion: 
The application of Hem-o-Lok demonstrates a comparable to endoloop ligation in terms of operative time and a potential benefit on the complication. When considering financial and technical aspects, it serves as an alternative to endoloop.",1
"Abstract
Probiotic is little known for its benefits on upper gastrointestinal health. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the frequency and severity of symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the general adult population. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for prospective studies on GERD, heartburn, regurgitation, and dyspepsia, without any limitation on sample size. The Jadad scale was used to evaluate the quality of randomized controlled trials. In total, 13 prospective studies that were published in 12 articles were included in the analysis and scored per the Jadad scale as high- (five studies), medium- (two), and low- (six) quality. One article reported on two probiotic groups; thus, 14 comparisons were included in the selected studies, of which 11 (79%) reported positive benefits of probiotics on symptoms of GERD. Five out of 11 positive outcomes (45%) noted benefits on reflux symptoms: three noted reduced regurgitation; improvements in reflux or heartburn were seen in one study; five (45%) saw improvements in dyspepsia symptoms; and nine (81%) saw improvements in other upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea (three studies), abdominal pain (five), and gas-related symptoms (four), such as belching, gurgling, and burping. In conclusion, probiotic use can be beneficial for GERD symptoms, such as regurgitation and heartburn. However, proper placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blinded clinical trials with a sufficient number of participants are warranted to confirm its efficacy in alleviating these symptoms. Further, interventions with longer durations and an intermediate analysis of endpoints should be considered to determine the proper therapeutic window.",1

Background
To investigate the association between keratoconus (KC) and allergic eye diseases, eye rubbing, and atopy.

Methods
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies investigating eye allergy, atopy, and eye rubbing as risk factors for KC up to April 2021. Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study analysed the prevalence of KC and its risk factors, including eye rubbing, family history of KC, atopy, and allergic eye diseases. The National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tool was used. Pooled data are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The analysis was conducted using RevMan version 5.4 software.

Results
The initial search yielded 573 articles. After screening, 21 studies were identified for qualitative analysis and 15 for quantitative synthesis. A significant association was found between KC and eye rubbing (OR = 5.22, 95% CI [2.80, 9.75], p < 0.00001), family history of KC (OR = 6.67, 95% CI [4.77, 9.33], p < 0.00001), and allergies (OR = 2.21, 95% CI [1.57, 3.13], p < 0.00001). However, no significant association was found between KC and allergic eye disease (OR = 1.82, 95% CI [0.37, 8.97], p = 0.46), atopy (OR = 1.54, 95% CI [0.58, 4.09], p = 0.39), allergic rhinitis (OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.54, 1.33], p = 0.47), smoking (OR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.76, 1.21], p = 0.73), and asthma (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.99, 2.53], p = 0.05).

Conclusion
Significant associations were observed between KC and eye rubbing, family history, and allergy, but not with allergic eye disease, atopy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis.",1
"ABSTRACT
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is one of the most common causes of acute liver injury (ALI) in Western countries. Many studies have shown that the gut microbiota plays an important role in liver injury. Currently, the only approved treatment for APAP-induced ALI is N-acetylcysteine; therefore, it is essential to develop new therapeutic agents and explore the underlying mechanisms. We developed a novel monoclonal anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antibody (ATAB) and hypothesized that it has therapeutic effects on APAP-induced ALI and that the gut microbiota may be involved in the underlying mechanism of ATAB treatment. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with APAP and ATAB, which produced a therapeutic effect on ALI and altered the members of the gut microbiota and their metabolic pathways, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and the fatty acid pathway, etc. Furthermore, we verified that purified short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) could alleviate ALI. Moreover, a separate group of mice that received feces from the ATAB group showed less severe liver injury than mice that received feces from the APAP group. ATAB therapy also improved gut barrier functions in mice and reduced the expression of the protein zonulin. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the therapeutic effect of ATAB on APAP-induced ALI.",1
"Abstract
 Manganese oxides have been frequently used as cathodes in primary batteries.
Applications of manganese oxides in secondary batteries are limited by low electrical
conductivity and rapid capacity fading due to electrode pulverization and aggregation. In this
study, a solid-state synthetic strategy is presented which successfully combines nano-size (ca.
50 nm) nickel doped α-MnO2 with reduced graphene oxides as highly stable composite anodes
in lithium ion batteries. The synthesis approach is easy to scale up and suitable for industrial
applications. The rationally designed Ni-α-MnO2/RGO was tested in galvanostatic half coin
cells for Li+ charge-discharge studies. The results show that this composite maintains a high
capacity of 615 mAh g-1 even after 200 cycles at a high current rate of 1 C (830 mA g-1), and
with a high coulombic efficiency near 99%. The anodes exhibit excellent rate capability in a
wide range of rate testing from 0.2 C to 10 C, without showing capacity decay. This superior
anode performance is ascribed to the reduced size of α-MnO2 domains that are well dispersed
in an RGO matrix which affords good ionic/electrical conductivity, low charge transfer
resistance and mitigates issues of volume expansion of the anodic active materials. This study
opens up an avenue for developing the manufacturing of high-performance electrodes for real
applications such as batteries in electrical vehicles. ",1

Objectives:
This study aimed to conduct a 2-year follow-up of mental disorders in healthcare workers (HCWs) in a region of China outside the epidemic's core zone who happened to be directly or possibly exposed to persons with COVID-19.

Material and Methods:
A cognitive analysis scale was utilized in the evaluation the mental or emotional state of HCWs at Xuzhou Medical University's affiliated hospital in the city of Xuzhou, China (a non-core epidemic area) 2 years after the first assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 165 HCWs were selected as the study subjects. In accordance to the exposure risk of COVID-19 patients, the subjects were separated into 2 categories: a group with a high risk HCW (HHCW) (HCWs working in COVID-19-positive wards; N = 91) and a group with a minimal risk HCW (LHCW) (HCWs who worked in wards without COVID-19 patients at the same hospital; N = 75). The clinical as well as demographic information of every HCWs were collected.

Results:
The demographic data revealed significant differences in terms of occupation, remuneration, and selfless concerns amidst both categories (p < 0.05). There lacked a statistically notable difference in the occurrence of PTSD between the 2 groups. Data was analyzed for factors associated with PTSD, and the results showed that psychological resilience, job risk, and stress in the workplace were risk factors for PTSD. Additionally, the results of the logistic regression analysis showed that psychological resilience was a significant shared risk factor for PTSD in HCWs after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusions:
The 2-year follow-up showed no statistical difference in the incidence of PTSD between the HHCW group and the LHCW group. Workplace stress, occupational hazards, and psychological resilience were the major contributing risk factors for PTSD in HCWs.

"ABSTRACT
The main objective of this study is to investigate the regulatory roles of the miR-17-5p/RRM2 axis in A549/G+ cells’ gemcitabine resistance. The cell viability was determined using CCK8 and clonogenic assays. Gene expression level analysis by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. The dual luciferase activity assay was used to verify the target gene of miR-17-5p. In gemcitabine-resistant cell line A549G+, the drug resistance decreased after up-regulation of MiR-17-5p expression. The proportion of cell cycle G1 phase increased, and the S phase decreased. The expression level of cell cycle-related proteins CCNE1, CCNA2, and P21 decreased. The opposite results emerged after the down-regulation of MiR-17-5p expression in gemcitabine-sensitive cell line A549G–. The expression levels of PTEN and PIK3 in A549G+ cells were higher than in A549G-cells, but p-PTEN was lower than that in A549G–. After up-regulating the expression of MiR-17-5p in A549G+, the expression levels of p-PTEN increased, and the expression level of p-AKT decreased. After down-regulating miR-17-5p expression, the opposite results emerged. The dual-luciferase reporter assay and restorative experiments proved that RRM2 is one of the target genes for MiR-17-5p. Our results suggested that the miR-17-5p/RRM2 axis could adjust gemcitabine resistance in A549 cells, and the p-PTEN/PI3K/AKT signal pathway might be involved in this regulatory mechanism.",1
"Abstract Objective: To better characterize the current state of
testosterone use in the surgical correction of hypospadias among
pediatric urologists.
Methods: An email was sent via the pedsurologyresearch listserv
through the American Academy of Pediatrics, inviting members to
participate in an anonymous survey regarding their use of
preoperative testosterone in hypospadias correction.
Results: Twenty-seven responses were obtained for a response rate
of 53%. Almost all responders practiced in North America, had
exclusively pediatric patients in their practice, and had been in
practice for 30 years or less. 55% were classified as high-volume
surgeons, completing >50 cases yearly, 87% of whom use
preoperative androgen therapy currently, compared with 67% of
low-volume surgeons. Testosterone was prescribed primarily for a
small appearing penis, reduced glans circumference, reduced
urethral plate width, and/or proximal hypospadias. The effect of
testosterone was determined primarily by evaluating penile
appearance (59%). However, the majority (56%) of physicians stopped giving testosterone when they completed a predetermined
regimen.
Conclusions: While many pediatric urologists use testosterone
prior to hypospadias repair, the practice patterns are variable. It
appears that the use of testosterone is primarily limited to patients
with proximal hypospadias, small appearing penis, reduced glans
circumference or reduced urethral plate. ",1
"Abstract
Published studies researching the prognostic significance of ezrin expression in patients with osteosarcoma are inconclusive and heterogeneous. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess its prognostic value more precisely. The hazard ratios with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate the effects. Five studies with 318 osteosarcoma patients were included to estimate the relationship between ezrin and disease-free survival, and ezrin and overall survival. Compared with osteosarcoma patients with low or negative ezrin expression, patients with high ezrin expression tended to be associated with lower disease-free survival, but the difference was not significant. However, patients with high ezrin expression were obviously associated with lower overall survival. Therefore, the findings from this systematic review suggest that ezrin expression is an effective biomarker of prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma.",1
"ABSTRACT
Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs) can promote new bone formation. Previous studies have proven the ability of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to modulate the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. However, the molecular mechanism modulated by lncRNAs in affecting the osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs remains largely unknown. Thus, this study aims to reveal the role of lncRNA ubiquitin-specific peptidase 2 antisense RNA 1 (USP2-AS1) in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs and investigate its regulatory mechanism. Through bioinformatics analysis and RT-qPCR, we confirmed that USP2-AS1 expression was increased in HBMSCs after culturing in osteogenic differentiation medium (OM-HBMSCs). Moreover, we uncovered that knockdown of USP2-AS1 inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs. Further exploration indicated that USP2-AS1 positively regulated the expression of its nearby gene USP2. Mechanistically, USP2-AS1 recruited lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) to stabilize ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1), transcription factor that transcriptionally activated USP2. Additionally, USP2-induced Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway activation via deubiquitination of β-catenin protein. In summary, our study proved that lncRNA USP2-AS1 facilitates the osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs by targeting KDM3A/ETS1/USP2 axis to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.",1
"Abstract
Accumulating evidence indicates that the aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is involved in tumorigenesis and cancer development. However, the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs in bladder cancer (BC) remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in BC using a microarray assay. We found that lncRNA RP11-79H23.3 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were significantly downregulated in BC tissues and cells. Meanwhile, RP11-79H23.3 expression was negatively correlated with clinical stage in BC. Functionally, we found that overexpression of RP11-79H23.3 could suppress cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycle progression, rearrange the cytoskeleton, and induce apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, upregulation of RP11-79H23.3 inhibited the angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and lung metastasis in vivo, whereas RP11-79H23.3 knockdown exerted a contrary role. Mechanistically, we identified that RP11-79H23.3 could directly bind to miR-107 and abolish the suppressive effect on target gene PTEN, which leads to inactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Taken together, we first demonstrated that RP11-79H23.3 might suppress the pathogenesis and development of BC by acting as a sponge for miR-107 to increase PTEN expression. Our research revealed that RP11-79H23.3 could be a potential target for diagnosis and therapy of BC.",1
"Accumulating evidence suggested that neuroinflammation played a crucial role in dopaminergic neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been proposed as a key molecule in the onset and sustainment of the inflammatory response. Engagement of RAGE contributed to neuroinflammation by upregulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as well as cytokines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of RAGE in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice and elucidate the RAGE signal pathway involved in the inflammation. Results showed that RAGE protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) were upregulated in MPTP-treated mice. Further experiments showed that RAGE ablation inhibited phosphorylation of IκB and p38 and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons against cell death in the substantia nigra (SN). These results suggested that RAGE participated in the pathogenesis of PD by neuroinflammation and p38MAPK-NFκB signal pathway may be involved in the process. Moreover, interfering with RAGE signaling pathway may be a reasonable therapeutic option in slowing PD development and progression.",1
"Abstract
AIM: To confirm whether insulin regulates resistin expression and secretion during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and the relationship of resistin with insulin resistance both in vivo and in vitro.

METHODS: Supernatant resistin was measured during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. L6 rat myoblasts and hepatoma cell line H4IIE were used to confirm the cellular function of resistin. Diet-induced obese rats were used as an insulin resistance model to study the relationship of resistin with insulin resistance.

RESULTS: Resistin expression and secretion were enhanced during differentiation 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This cellular differentiation stimulated resistin expression and secretion, but was suppressed by insulin. Resistin also induced insulin resistance in H4IIE hepatocytes and L6 myoblasts. In diet-induced obese rats, serum resistin levels were negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity, but not with serum insulin.

CONCLUSION: Insulin can inhibit resistin expression and secretion in vitro, but insulin is not a major regulator of resistin in vivo. Fat tissue mass affects insulin sensitivity by altering the expression and secretion of resistin.

"ABSTRACT
Background and aims: With no established standard for assessing tobacco dependence (TD) across tobacco
products in surveys, the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study provides a unique platform
for examining the psychometric properties and validity of multiple indicators of tobacco dependence across a
range of tobacco products.
Participants: A U.S. nationally representative sample from the 32,320 adult Wave 1 interviews with analyses
focused on 14,287 respondents who were current established users of tobacco products.
Findings: This analysis confirms a single primary latent construct underlying responses to TD indicators for
cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and smokeless tobacco products. Mutually exclusive past year tobaccouser groups included: cigarette only (n = 8689), e-cigarette only (n = 437), cigar only (traditional, cigarillo, or
filtered) (n = 706), hookah only (n = 461), smokeless tobacco only (n = 971), cigarette plus e-cigarette
(n = 709), and multiple tobacco product users (n = 2314). Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analyses supported use of 16 of the 24 examined TD indicators for comparisons across tobacco users. With cigarette users as a
reference (mean = 0.0, SD = 1.0), we observed a range of TD with hookah (mean = −1.71) and cigar

"ABSTRACT
Background and aims: With no established standard for assessing tobacco dependence (TD) across tobacco
products in surveys, the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study provides a unique platform
for examining the psychometric properties and validity of multiple indicators of tobacco dependence across a
range of tobacco products.
Participants: A U.S. nationally representative sample from the 32,320 adult Wave 1 interviews with analyses
focused on 14,287 respondents who were current established users of tobacco products.
Findings: This analysis confirms a single primary latent construct underlying responses to TD indicators for
cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and smokeless tobacco products. Mutually exclusive past year tobaccouser groups included: cigarette only (n = 8689), e-cigarette only (n = 437), cigar only (traditional, cigarillo, or
filtered) (n = 706), hookah only (n = 461), smokeless tobacco only (n = 971), cigarette plus e-cigarette
(n = 709), and multiple tobacco product users (n = 2314). Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analyses supported use of 16 of the 24 examined TD indicators for comparisons across tobacco users. With cigarette users as a
reference (mean = 0.0, SD = 1.0), we observed a range of TD with hookah (mean = −1.71) and cigar
(mean = −1.92) only users being the lowest, and cigarette plus e-cigarette product users being the highest
(mean = 0.35). Regression models including sociodemographic factors supported concurrent validity with increased product use frequency and TD among cigarette-only (p < 0.001), e-cigarette only (p < 0.002), cigar
(p < 0.001), hookah only (p < 0.001), and smokeless tobacco users (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: The PATH Study Adult Wave 1 Questionnaire provided psychometrically valid measures of TD that
enables future regulatory investigations of nicotine dependence across tobacco products.",1
"Background: The leading cause of death in China is stroke, a condition that also contributes heavily to the disease burden. Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common cause of stroke. Compared to Western countries, in China the proportion of ICH is significantly higher. Standardized treatment based on evidence-based medicine can help reduce ICH's burden. In the present study we aimed to explore the agreement between the management strategies during ICH's acute phase and Class I recommendations in current international practice guidelines in Beijing (China), and to elucidate the reasons underlying any inconsistencies found.

Method: We retrospectively collected in-hospital data from 1,355 ICH patients from 15 hospitals in Beijing between January and December 2012. Furthermore, a total of 75 standardized questionnaires focusing on ICH's clinical management were distributed to 15 cooperative hospitals. Each hospital randomly selected five doctors responsible for treating ICH patients to complete the questionnaires.

Results: Numerous approaches were in line with Class I recommendations, as follows: upon admission, all patients underwent radiographic examination, about 93% of the survivors received health education and 84.5% of those diagnosed with hypertension were prescribed antihypertensive treatment at discharge, in-hospital antiepileptic drugs were administered to 91.8% of the patients presenting with seizures, and continuous monitoring was performed for 88% of the patients with hyperglycemia on admission. However, several aspects were inconsistent with the guidelines, as follows: only 14.2% of the patients were initially managed in the neurological intensive care unit and 22.3% of the bedridden patients received preventive treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 48 h after onset. The questionnaire results showed that imaging examination, blood glucose monitoring, and secondary prevention of ICH were useful to more clinicians. However, the opposite occurred for the neurological intensive care unit requirement. Regarding the guidelines' recognition, no significant differences among the 3 education subgroups were observed (p > 0.05).

Conclusions: Doctors have recognized most of ICH's evidence-based practice guidelines. However, there are still large gaps between the management of ICH and the evidence-based practice guidelines in Beijing (China). Retraining doctors is required, including focusing on preventing DVT providing a value from the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Glasgow Coma Scalescores at the time of admission.

"Currently, inhibiting or reducing neuronal cell death is the main strategy to improve
recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI). Therapies using nerve growth factors to treat SCI
mainly focused on reducing the area damaged by postinjury degeneration to promote
functional recovery. In this report, we investigated the mechanism of ER (endoplasmic
reticulum) stress-induced apoptosis and the protective action of fibroblast growth factor
22 (FGF22) in vivo. Our results demonstrated that ER stress-induced apoptosis plays a
significant role in injury of SCI model rats. FGF22 administration promoted recovery and
increased neuron survival in the spinal cord lesions of model mice. The protective effect of
FGF22 is related to decreased expression of CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), GRP78
(glucose-regulated protein 78), caspase-12, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), eukaryotic
initiation factor 2a (Eif-2a) and Bad which are ER stress-induced apoptosis response
proteins. Moreover, FGF22 administration also increased the number of neurons and the
expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) which was related to axon
regeneration. We also demonstrated that the protective effect of FGF22 effectively
reduces neuronal apoptosis and promotes axonal regeneration. Our study first
illustrated that the function of FGF22 is related to the inhibition of ER stress-induced
cell death in SCI recovery via activation of downstream signals. This study also suggested
a new tendency of FGF22 therapy development in central neural system injuries, which
involved chronic ER stress-induced apoptosis.",1
"Abstract
Background/Aims: Pulmonary arterial endothelial plexiform lesions are a basic pathological change associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling and are characterized by the formation of tumorlets as a result of over-growth of endothelial cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) participates in regulating the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, whether PDGF promotes the survival of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs), as well as the specific molecular mechanisms that underlie its actions, remains unknown. Methods: MTT assays, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity assays and western blot analysis were performed. Results: We found that both the mRNA and protein expression of PDGF-B was induced by hypoxia and that the inhibitory effects exerted by hypoxia on apoptosis were attenuated by inhibitors of PDGF beta. Moreover, PDGF-B inhibited apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by stimulating the phosphorylation of both Akt and Stat3, and the PI3K/AKT pathway serves as an up-stream participant in the Stat3 activation stimulated by PDGF-B. Additionally, the anti-apoptotic effects of PDGF-B were abolished when PAECs were treated with either an inhibitor or small interfering RNA targeting Stat3. Conclusions: These observations suggest that PDGF-B is induced by hypoxia and protects against apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt/Stat3 signaling pathway.",1

Lattice vibrations and electrical transport properties of SrV2O6 (SVO) and BaV2O6 (BVO) under
high pressure have been investigated by Raman spectra and alternating current (AC) impedance
spectra measurements. A pressure-induced structural phase transition in SVO is observed at
3.9 GPa, and the phase transition in BVO happens at 4.3 GPa from their high-pressure Raman
spectra. With further increasing pressures, amorphization is found in both SVO and BVO at 10.1
and 9.3 GPa, respectively. Pressure-induced amorphization of SVO and BVO is suggested to be
associated with the breaking up of infinite chains of corner-linked tetrahedral VO4 into VO3
. The
recovery of original crystalline phases along with the re-linking of VO3
 chains is observed
after heating the reclaimed samples. Furthermore, the in situ high pressure measurements of AC
impedance spectra of BVO reveal two distinct changes in its resistance, which can correspond to

"OBJECTIVES
The effectiveness of delayed surgery for ventricular septal rupture (VSR) following myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with cardiogenic shock remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of delayed surgery following mechanical circulatory support for patients in cardiogenic shock after VSR.

METHODS
We reviewed 8 patients with post-MI VSR and cardiogenic shock who underwent delayed surgery at our institution between July 2015 and November 2017. Surgery was delayed until haemodynamic stabilization and improved organ ischaemia were achieved by initiating intra-aortic balloon pumping with or without veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We investigated the operative mortality, morbidity and late survival.

RESULTS
All 8 patients had preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump support, and 5 had additional veno-arterial ECMO support. Emergency repair was successfully avoided in all cases. The median time from the onset of MI to operation was 7.1 (3.7–9.9) days, and that from the diagnosis of VSR to operation was 1.9 (1.3–2.3) days. The operative mortality was 12.5%, and complications related to mechanical circulatory support occurred in 1 case (12.5%). The 2-year survival rate was 62.5%.

CONCLUSIONS
A combination of preoperative mechanical circulatory support and delayed surgery may improve the outcomes of patients with post-MI VSR, which was complicated by cardiogenic shock. The key to a better surgical outcome may be delaying the surgery for improving end-organ perfusion. This requires further investigation, especially for determining the optimal duration of support.",1
"Abstract
Increasing research has proved that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in a variety of biological processes. However, their functions in cerebral ischemia are still unclear. We found that the small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) is a new type of lncRNA induced by ischemia/reperfusion. Here, we show that the expression of SNHG12 was upregulated in the brain tissue of mice exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and primary mouse cerebral cortex neurons treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Mechanistically, SNHG12 knockdown resulted in larger infarct sizes and worse neurological scores in MCAO/R mice. Consistent with the in vivo results, SNHG12 upregulation significantly increased the viability and prevented apoptosis of neurons cultured under OGD/R conditions. In addition, we found that SNHG12 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) with microRNA (miR)-136-5p, thereby regulating the inhibition of its endogenous target Bcl-2. Moreover, SNHG12 was proven to target miR-136-5p, increasing Bcl-2 expression, which finally led to the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated that SNHG12 acts as a ceRNA of miR-136-5p, thereby targets and regulates the expression of Bcl-2, which attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This knowledge helps to better understand the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemic stroke and may provide new treatment options for this disease.",1
"Abstract
The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) genes have been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the associations between polymorphisms of ALDH2 and ADH2 genes and HCC. Published literatures from PubMed and Embase were retrieved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Ten studies including 1,231 HCC cases and 1,849 controls were included in the meta-analysis of the association between ALDH2 polymorphism and HCC risk. The results indicated that ALDH2 polymorphism was not significantly associated with risk of HCC (homogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.72–1.34; heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.75–1.08; dominant model: OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.70–1.18; recessive model: OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.66–1.87). In addition, four studies including 518 cases and 607 controls were included in the meta-analysis of the association between ADH2 polymorphism and HCC risk. There was no association between ADH2 polymorphism and HCC risk (homogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.58–1.51; heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.87–2.23; dominant model: OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.76–1.88; recessive model: OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.54–1.54). Further analysis suggested that the ALDH2 polymorphism–alcohol interaction was marginally associated with HCC risk under the dominant model (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.01–4.17). However, the result was not robust by sensitivity analysis. The results from the present meta-analysis indicated that there was no significant association between ALDH2 polymorphism, ADH2 polymorphism, or ALDH2 polymorphism–alcohol intake interaction and HCC risk in the East Asians.",1
"Abstract
The intracellular redox and the circadian clock in photosynthetic organisms are two major regulators globally affecting various biological functions. Both of the global control systems have evolved as systems to adapt to regularly or irregularly changing light environments. Here, we report that the two global regulators mutually interact in cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, a model photosynthetic organism whose clock molecular mechanism is well known. Electrochemical assay using a transmembrane electron mediator revealed that intracellular redox of S. elongatus PCC7942 cell exhibited circadian rhythms under constant light conditions. The redox rhythm disappeared when transcription/translation of clock genes is defunctionalized, indicating that the transcription/translation controlled by a core KaiABC oscillator generates the circadian redox rhythm. Importantly, the amplitude of the redox rhythm at a constant light condition was large enough to affect the KaiABC oscillator. The findings indicated that the intracellular redox state is actively controlled to change in a 24-h cycle under constant light conditions by the circadian clock system.",1
"Abstract
Background: Pain assessments, such as the Numerical Pain Scale (NPS) and Wong-Baker FACEs (FACEs), offer methods to quantify pain with simplistic descriptions on a scale of 0-10 or facial expressions. These tools have limitations and deliver insufficient information to the provider developing a pain management plan. A new Functional Pain Scale (FPS) assesses other scopes of pain, including the loss of function in activities of daily living, sleep habits, and communication. Although NPS and FACEs are traditionally used in clinical practice, FPS provides a functional assessment to help patients self-report their pain to their providers. 

Aim: Our study attempts to show a comparative data analysis of the FPS to NPS and FACEs. The purpose of our study is not to demonstrate FPS's superiority over NPS and FACEs but to fill the gaps of information necessary to communicate the type of pain a patient has to their provider. Due to its descriptive nature and clear scores, FPS should be implemented within electronic medical records (EMR) to help providers assess patients’ pain and evaluate the efficacy of interventions selected based on that pain.

Design: A prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study was performed, with simultaneously administered surveys to compare pains scores on a new FPS to the common NPS and FACEs. The target sample was postoperative orthopedic patients above 18 years of age who can read and speak English. Patients were surveyed on all three pain scales: FPS, NPS, and FACEs and were asked to rate their pain perioperatively after their respective orthopedic procedures.

Methods: Spearman correlation method was used to test for correlation between the three pain scales and Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare means between FPS and NPS.

Results: FPS has a strong correlation with FACEs (r = 0.647, p<0.05) and with NPS (r = 0.634, p<0.05). There is a significant difference in mean scores between FPS and NPS.

Conclusion and study implications: The most reliable marker of pain is patient self-reporting. In routine assessment, because pain is one-dimensional, we as providers need to better define the range of 0-10. This can only be done via an algorithm regarding which functions are lost as pain intensities increase. FPS fits those requirements by offering suitable descriptions with each pain score. The implications of the study include a chance to remedy the opioid crisis that plagues healthcare. We need tools that assess and educate patients about their pain level and appropriately convey that information to providers. Furthermore, this study is a chance for innovative tools to be implemented to better change healthcare practice. If FPS gains traction, it can improve pain communication between patients and providers.

"Abstract
The load transfer difficulty caused by borehole wall friction limits the rate of penetration (ROP) and extended-reach limit of complex structural well enormously. A new friction reduction technology called “earthworm-like drilling”, which can improve the load transfer and extended-reach limit, is proposed in this paper. A mathematical model based on “soft-string” model is developed to analysis the characteristics of this technology. Simulation results indicate that more stick-slip and load transfer issue are caused by higher friction. The earthworm-like drilling is more effective in reducing friction than single-point vibration drilling and less effective than multi-point vibration drilling because of the pulse pressure attenuation. However, this disadvantage can be offset by adding the number of axial oscillators. Amplitude and frequency of pulse pressure and the installation position of axial oscillators have great impact on the friction reduction and load transfer. An optimizing model based on projection gradient method is developed and used to optimize the position of three axial oscillators in a three-dimensional horizontal well. The weight on bit (WOB) increases significantly after the optimized position and the new position of axial oscillators move towards bottom of well and close to each other. Results verify the feasibility and advantages of earthworm-like drilling, and lay a solid theoretical foundation for its application in oil field drilling.",1
"Abstract
Recent studies suggest that neuron–glia interactions are involved in multiple aspects of neuronal activity regulation. In the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neuron–glia interactions are thought to participate in the integration of autonomic responses to physiological challenges. However, it remains to be shown whether NTS glial cells might influence breathing and cardiovascular control, and also if they could be integral to the autonomic and respiratory responses to hypoxic challenges. Here, we investigated whether NTS glia play a tonic role in the modulation of central respiratory and sympathetic activities as well as in the changes in respiratory–sympathetic coupling induced by exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a model of central autonomic and respiratory plasticity. We show that bilateral microinjections of fluorocitrate (FCt), a glial cell inhibitor, into the caudal and intermediate subnuclei of the NTS did not alter baseline respiratory and sympathetic parameters in in situ preparations of juvenile rats. Similar results were observed in rats previously exposed to CIH. Likewise, CIH-induced changes in respiratory–sympathetic coupling were unaffected by FCt-mediated inhibition. However, microinjection of FCt into the ventral medulla produced changes in respiratory frequency. Our results show that acute glial inhibition in the NTS does not affect baseline respiratory and sympathetic control. Additionally, we conclude that NTS glial cells may not be necessary for the continuous manifestation of sympathetic and respiratory adaptations to CIH. Our work provides evidence that neuron–glia interactions in the NTS do not participate in baseline respiratory and sympathetic control.",1

Background
The role of androgens on COVID-19 is well established. Proxalutamide is a second-generation, non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) with the highest antiandrogen potency among NSAAs and concurrent regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and inflammatory response. Proxalutamide has been demonstrated to be effective to prevent hospitalizations in early COVID-19 in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Conversely, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, preliminary results from two different arms of an RCT (The Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV Trial) also demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality. This study aims to report the final, joint results of the two arms (North arm and South arm) of the Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV trial of the two arms (North and South arms) combined, and to evaluate whether COVID-19 response to proxalutamide was consistent across different regions (Northern Brazil and Southern Brazil).

Materials and methods
Upon randomization, hospitalized COVID-19 patients received either proxalutamide 300mg/day or placebo for 14 days, in addition to usual care, in a proxalutamide:placebo ratio of 1:1 in the North arm and 4:1 in the South arm (ratio was modified due to preliminary report of high drug efficacy). Datasets of the South and North arms were combined, and statistical analysis was performed for the overall study population. Proxalutamide was compared to placebo group for 14-day and 28-day recovery (discharge alive from the hospital) and mortality rates, and overall and post-randomization hospitalization stay. Results of proxalutamide and placebo groups were also compared between the North and South arms. Analysis was also performed stratified by sex and baseline WHO COVID Ordinary Score.

Results
A total of 778 subjects were included (645 from the North, 317 from the proxalutamide group and 328 from the placebo group; 133 from the South arm, 106 from the proxalutamide group and 27 from the placebo group). Recovery rate was 121% higher in proxalutamide than placebo group at day 14 [81.1% vs 36.6%; Recovery ratio (RecR) 2.21; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.92-2.56; p<0.0001], and 81% higher at day 28 (98.1% vs 47.6%; RecR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.61-2.03; p<0.0001). All-cause mortality rate was 80% lower in proxalutamide than placebo group at Day 14 [8.0% vs 39.2%; Risk ratio (RR), 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29; p<0.0001], and 78% lower at Day 28 (10.6% vs 48.2%; RR, 0.22; 95% CI 0.16-0.30). Post-randomization time-to-discharge was shorter in proxalutamide [median, 5 days; interquartile range (IQR), 3-8] than placebo group (median, 9 days; IQR, 6-14) (p<0.0001). Results were statistically similar between North and South arms for all measured outcomes. Males and females presented similar results in all outcomes. Patients that did not require oxygen use (scores 3 and 4) did not present statistically significant improvement in recovery and mortality rates, whereas scores 5 and 6 presented significant improvements in all outcomes (p<0.0001 for all).

Conclusion
Proxalutamide increased recovery rate, reduced mortality rate and shortened hospital stay in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results were similar between the two different arms, providing further consistency for the efficacy of proxalutamide when used in late-stage COVID-19.",1

Growing evidence indicates that the endophytic fungus Aspergillus is one of rich sources of natural products with a broad
spectrum of biological activities. In our effort to isolate and to identify biologically active metabolites from naturally
occurring sources, two endophytic fungi have been isolated from the tissues of Ipomoea carnea. Among the two isolates, one
fungus displayed pronounced antimicrobial activity, against pathogenic microbes includes Gram+ve bacteria; Staphylococcus
aureus and Bacillus subtilis, Gram–ve bacteria; Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli and Yeasts; Candida albicans
with inhibition zone range from 16 to 19 mm. The most potent isolate has been identified genetically by sequencing of 18S
rRNA gene as Aspergillus terreus AH1. Bioguided-fractionation and isolation of Aspergillus terreus AH1 extract led to
identification of five compounds namely; (+)-asterrelenin (1), (±)-periplanamide B (2), butyrolactone I (3), pyranterrone D
(4), and Arenarin A (5). The identified compounds showed a strong antibiofilm activity against human pathogenic bacteria
such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Moreover, the compound
((±)-periplanamide B) has strong activity against some carcinoma cell lines such as HCT116, HePG 2 and MCF7",1
"Abstract
Neutrophils plays a crucial role in acute ischemic brain injury and have emerged as potential treatment targets to mitigate such injuries. Lysine-specific demethylase 4 A (KDM4A), a member of the histone lysine demethylase family of enzymes involved in transcriptional regulation of gene expression, is upregulated during hypoxic events. However, the exact role of KDM4A in the pathological process of ischemic stroke remains largely unexplored. Our findings reveal that there was an upregulation of KDM4A levels in reactive astrocytes within both stroke mouse models and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/regeneration (OGD/R) models. Using a conditional knockout mouse, we observed that astrocytic Kdm4a knockout regulates neutrophil infiltration and alleviates brain injury following middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion. Furthermore, Kdm4a deficiency astrocytes displayed lower chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1) level upon OGD/R and decreased neutrophil infiltration in a transwell system. Mechanistically, KDM4A, in cooperation with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), activates Cxcl1 gene expression by demethylating histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at Cxcl1 gene promoters in astrocytes upon OGD/R injury. Our findings suggest that astrocyte KDM4A-mediated Cxcl1 activation contributes to neutrophil infiltration via cooperation with NF-κB, and KDM4A in astrocytes may serve as a potential therapeutic target to modulate neutrophil infiltration after stroke.",1

The evolving COVID-19 epidemic pose significant threats and challenges to emergency response operations. This paper focuses on designing an emergency logistic network, including the deployment of emergency facilities and the allocation of supplies to satisfy the time-varying demands. A Demand prediction-Network optimization-Decision adjustment framework is proposed for the emergency logistic network design. We first present an improved short-term epidemic model to predict the evolutionary trajectory of the epidemic. Then, considering the uncertainty of the estimated demands, we construct a capacitated multi-period, multi-echelon facility deployment and resource allocation robust optimization model to improve the reliability of the decisions. To address the conservativeness of robust solutions during the evolution of the epidemic, an uncertainty budget adjustment strategy is proposed and integrated into the rolling horizon optimization approach. The results of the case study show that (i) the short-term prediction method has higher accuracy and the accuracy increases with the amount of observed data; (ii) considering the demand uncertainty, the proposed robust optimization model combined with uncertainty budget adjustment strategy can improve the performance of the emergency logistic network; (iii) the proposed solution method is more efficient than its benchmark, especially for large-scale cases. Moreover, some managerial insights related to the emergency logistics network design problem are presented.",1

The modulatory roles of numerous circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been exposited in atherosclerosis (AS). Our study paid attention to the function of circRNA_ 0124644 (circ_0124644) in AS development, as well as its functional mechanism. The AS cell model was established by the treatment of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cell proliferation and cycle were severally measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell cycle detection kit. The examination of apoptosis rate was executed through flow cytometry. Western blot was exploited for detecting the associated proteins. The expression levels of circ_0124644 and microRNA-149-5p (miR-149-5p) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were assayed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The combination of targets was validated via the dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assay. Clonal capacity was analyzed using colony formation assay. Ox-LDL restrained HUVECs proliferation and cycle, but facilitated apoptosis. Circ_0124644 expression was increased, while miR-149-5p was downregulated in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Besides, circ_0124644 served as a molecular sponge of miR-149-5p and intensified the ox-LDL-induced HUVECs injury by sponging miR-149-5p. PAPP-A was a target of miR-149-5p and miR-149-5p could mitigate the HUVECs injury caused by ox-LDL through inhibiting PAPP-A. Moreover, PAPP-A was positively regulated by circ_0124644 via the miR-149-5p. In this report, we concluded the promoted role of circ_0124644 in the ox-LDL-induced endothelial injury of HUVECs via the miR-149-5p/PAPP-A axis with an emphasis on its diagnostic and therapeutic values in AS.

Rapid advances in genomics discovery tools and a growing realization of microRNA’s implication in intercellular communication have led to a proliferation of studies of circulating microRNA sorting and regulation across cells and different species. Although sometimes, reaching controversial scientific discoveries and conclusions, these studies have yielded new insights in the functional roles of circulating microRNA and a plethora of analytical methods and tools. Here, we consider this body of work in light of key computational principles underpinning discovery of circulating microRNAs in terms of their sorting and targeting, with the goal of providing practical guidance for applications that is focused on the design and analysis of circulating microRNAs and their context-dependent regulation. We survey a broad range of informatics methods and tools that are available to the researcher, discuss their key features, applications and various unsolved problems and close this review with prospects and broader implication of this field.",1

Background
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that affects most of the digestive tract. There is no report of fertility reduction in medically managed IBD women compared with the general population. On the other hand, active IBD can lead to significantly decreased fertility. Over the previous 2 decades, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) has been an effective treatment for managing patients with IBD, increasing the use of infliximab and adalimumab in clinical practice. However, it is unclear which biologics are better for pregnant women with IBD.

Aim
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes following treatment with infliximab and adalimumab in women with IBD.

Methods
Bibliographic databases were retrieved from their inception to July 2022. The results were adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion.

Results
A total of 8 studies included 527 pregnant women with IBD. Of these, 343 received infliximab, and 184 received adalimumab therapy. Compared to adalimumab, adverse pregnancy outcomes were not increased in infliximab therapy including congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion.

Conclusion
Infliximab and adalimumab therapy did not show the difference of risk in adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD.

"Malignant gliomas have a highly tumorigenic subpopulation, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), that drives
tumor formation and proliferation. CSCs possess inherent resistance mechanisms against radiation- and
chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death, enabling them to survive and initiate tumor recurrence. We examined
the effect of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), a Wnt signaling antagonist, in chemosensitizing the
glioma cell line U138MG and glioma stem cells (GSCs) enriched from U138MG to chemotherapeutics. We
found that sFRP4 alone and in combination with either doxorubicin or cisplatin induced apoptosis. Proliferation
decreased substantially in GSC-enriched population as measured by MTT and BrdU assays. JC-1 and caspase-3 assays demonstrated that cell death was through the apoptotic pathway. sFRP4 treatment also decreased
neurosphere formation and induced neuronal differentiation. Inhibition by sFRP4 was abolished by Wnt3a,
indicating that sFRP4 acts through the frizzled receptor. Further indication that sFRP4 acts through the Wnt
b-catenin pathway was provided by decrease in the b-catenin protein and decrease in the b-catenin-stimulated
gene cyclin D1 upon sFRP4 induction. By real-time PCR, an increase in apoptotic markers Bax and p21, a
decrease in pro-proliferative marker CycD1, and a decrease in the GSC marker CD133 were observed. These
observations indicate that sFRP4 is able to sensitize glioma cells and stem cells to chemotherapeutics. We thus
identified for the first time that sFRP4 could help to destroy cancer stem cells of glioma cell line, which would
lead to effective treatment regimen to combat brain tumors",1
"abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
induced preterm delivery. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS in the presence or absence of previous TLR4 blockade was performed to establish
a murine model of preterm delivery. The incidences of preterm delivery and fetal death were calculated. Flow cytometry was performed to
examine the percentages of blood CD45þCD86þ, CD3þCD69þ, CD19þCD69þ and CD49bþCD69þ cell subsets, and the percentages of
placenta CD45þCD86þ, CD45þCD49bþ and CD49bþCD69þ cell subpopulations. In our study, an inflammation-induced preterm delivery
model was established by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Blocking TLR4 significantly decreased LPS-induced preterm delivery and fetal death.
LPS treatment markedly up-regulated the percentages of blood CD45þCD86þ, CD3þCD69þ and CD49bþCD69þ cells, and of placenta
CD45þCD86þ, CD45þCD49bþ and CD49bþCD69þ cells. TLR4 blockade almost completely abrogated LPS-induced elevated cell proportions. These data demonstrate that TLR4 plays a critical role in inflammation-induced preterm delivery.
Key words: TLR4 / lipopolysaccharide / inflammation / preterm delivery",1

Introduction: COVID 19 is known to cause immune dysregulation and vitamin D is a known immunomodulator. This study aims to objectively investigate the effect of short term high dose vitamin D therapy in reducing the inflammatory markers of COVID-19.

Materials and Methods: Consented COVID-19 patients with hypovitaminosis D were evaluated for inflammatory markers (N/L ratio, CRP, LDH, IL6, Ferritin) along with vitamin D on 0th day and 9th / 11th day as per their respective BMI category. Subjects were allotted to VD and NVD groups. VD group received Pulse D therapy (a short term high dose supplementation of 60,000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 or 10 days depending upon their BMI) in addition to the standard treatment. NVD group received standard treatment alone. Differences in the variables between the two groups were analysed for statistical significance.

Results: Eighty seven out of one hundred and thirty subjects have completed the study (VD:44, NVD:43). Vitamin D level has increased from 15 ng/ml to 81 ng/ml in VD group and highly significant (p<0.01) reduction of all the measured inflammatory markers was noted. Reduction of markers in NVD group was insignificant (p>0.05). The difference in the reduction of markers between the groups (NVD vs VD) was highly significant (p<0.01).

Conclusions: Therapeutic improvement in vitamin D to 80-100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 without any side effects. Hence, adjunctive short term high dose vitamin D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19 for improved outcomes.",1

Background
Depression is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in both coronary heart disease and depression.

Methods
Fifty-one inpatients and outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) in the university hospital of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health and 58 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls enrolled in this study. We investigated the association between the three polymorphisms of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene (single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); rs2070744, rs1799983, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 4) and scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, plasma metabolites of NO (NOx) or ankle brachial index in patients with MDD and healthy controls.

Results
We did not find significant differences in the genotype distributions between patients with MDD and healthy volunteers. No associations were observed between any of the polymorphisms of the eNOS gene and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or ankle brachial index in patients with MDD. However, plasma NOx level was significantly associated with a polymorphism of the eNOS gene (rs207044 and variable number tandem repeat in intron 4).

Conclusion
These results suggest that the direct association was not observed between the polymorphisms of the eNOS gene and the pathogenesis of depression. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Importance  Understanding the effect of antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) treatment on functional connectivity will help elucidate the mechanism by which it reduces the risk of cerebral palsy and death.

Objective  To determine whether MgSO4 administered to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks is associated with increased functional connectivity and measures of functional segregation and integration in infants at term-equivalent age, possibly reflecting a protective mechanism of MgSO4.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study was nested within a randomized placebo-controlled trial performed across 24 tertiary maternity hospitals. Participants included infants born to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks who participated in the MAGENTA (Magnesium Sulphate at 30 to 34 Weeks’ Gestational Age) trial and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. Ineligibility criteria included illness precluding MRI, congenital or genetic disorders likely to affect brain structure, and living more than 1 hour from the MRI center. One hundred and fourteen of 159 eligible infants were excluded due to incomplete or motion-corrupted MRI. Recruitment occurred between October 22, 2014, and October 25, 2017. Participants were followed up to 2 years of age. Analysis was performed from February 1, 2021, to February 27, 2024. Observers were blind to patient groupings during data collection and processing.

Exposures  Women received 4 g of MgSO4 or isotonic sodium chloride solution given intravenously over 30 minutes.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Prior to data collection, it was hypothesized that infants who were exposed to MgSO4 would show enhanced functional connectivity compared with infants who were not exposed.

Results  A total of 45 infants were included in the analysis: 24 receiving MgSO4 treatment and 21 receiving placebo; 23 (51.1%) were female and 22 (48.9%) were male; and the median gestational age at scan was 40.0 (IQR, 39.1-41.1) weeks. Treatment with MgSO4 was associated with greater voxelwise functional connectivity in the temporal and occipital lobes and deep gray matter structures and with significantly greater clustering coefficients (Hedge g, 0.47 [95% CI, −0.13 to 1.07]), transitivity (Hedge g, 0.51 [95% CI, −0.10 to 1.11]), local efficiency (Hedge g, 0.40 [95% CI, −0.20 to 0.99]), and global efficiency (Hedge g, 0.31 [95% CI, −0.29 to 0.90]), representing enhanced functional segregation and integration.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study, infants exposed to MgSO4 had greater voxelwise functional connectivity and functional segregation, consistent with increased brain maturation. Enhanced functional connectivity is a possible mechanism by which MgSO4 protects against cerebral palsy and death.",1
"Abstract
Background: Emotional eating in bariatric surgery patients is inconsistently linked with poor post-operative weight loss and eating behaviors, and much research to date is atheoretical. To examine theory-informed correlates of pre-operative emotional eating, the present cross-sectional analysis examined paths through which experienced weight bias and internalized weight bias (IWB) may associate with emotional eating among individuals seeking bariatric surgery.

Methods: We examined associations of experienced weight bias, IWB, shame, self-compassion, and emotional eating in patients from a surgical weight loss clinic (N = 229, 82.1% female, M. BMI: 48 ± 9). Participants completed a survey of validated self-report measures that were linked to BMI from the patient medical record. Multiple regression models tested associations between study constructs while PROCESS bootstrapping estimates tested the following hypothesized mediation model: IWB ➔ internalized shame ➔ self-compassion ➔ emotional eating. Primary analyses controlled for adverse childhood experiences (ACE), a common confound in weight bias research. Secondary analyses controlled for depressive/anxiety symptoms from the patient medical record (n = 196).

Results: After covariates and ACE, each construct accounted for significant unique variance in emotional eating. However, experienced weight bias was no longer significant and internalized shame marginal, after controlling for depressive/anxiety symptoms. In a mediation model, IWB was linked to greater emotional eating through heightened internalized shame and low self-compassion, including after controlling for depressive/anxiety symptoms.

Conclusions: Pre-bariatric surgery, IWB may signal risk of emotional eating, with potential implications for post-operative trajectories. Self-compassion may be a useful treatment target to reduce IWB, internalized shame, and related emotional eating in bariatric surgery patients. Further longitudinal research is needed.",1
"Abstract
Accumulating evidence has shown an abnormal expression of several non-coding RNAs in ovarian tissues which might be closely linked with the pathogenesis of PCOS. The aim of this study was to identify competing endogenous (ce) RNA network: long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and their target genes: androgen receptor (AR), follistatin (FST) and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), which are relevant to PCOS, to underline the molecular pathogenesis of PCOS and assist in early diagnosis and treatment. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to retrieve a ceRNA network: [lncRNA (NEAT1 and MALAT1) - miRNA (miR-30a-5p and miR-30d-5p) - mRNA (AR, FST and IRS-2)] linked to PCOS. Expression of the selected RNAs was examined by qPCR in peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from 73 PCOS patients (41 obese and 32 non-obese) and 31 healthy controls. PCOS patients showed significantly higher expression levels of NEAT1, miR-30a-5p, AR, FST and IRS-2, with significantly lower expression levels of MALAT1 and miR-30d-5p relative to controls especially in obese versus non-obese patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that most of the selected RNAs could serve as potential early diagnostic markers for PCOS with the highest efficiency obtained upon combining NEAT1 and miR-30d-5p or MALAT1 and miR-30a-5p with either of PCOS target genes. Moreover, all addressed RNAs had been proved as potential predictors of PCOS. The obtained data of ceRNA network raised the possibility that NEAT1 overexpression may increase the expression levels of AR, FST and IRS-2 by sponging miR-30d-5p, while low expression of MALAT1 may allow higher expression of the above genes via increasing miR-30a-5p, suggesting their involvement in PCOS pathogenesis and promising role for future diagnosis and targeted therapy.",1
"Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpetic virus, which infects 45–100% of people
worldwide. Many reports suggest that CMV could impair the cognitive functions of infected subjects.
Here we searched for indices of effects of CMV on infected subjects’ intelligence and knowledge. The
Intelligence Structure Test I-S-T 2000 R was used to compare the cognitive functions of 148
CMV-infected and 135 CMV-free university students. Infected students expressed higher cognitive
performance (p<0.001; η²=0.085), specifically verbal intelligence (p=0.039; η²=0.015) and verbal
knowledge (p<0.001; η²=0.049). Paradoxically, the cognitive performance, especially verbal (p =
0.024, Tau = 0.110), numeric (p = 0.041, Tau = 0.097), fluid (p = 0.021, Tau = 0.114), and general (p =
0.040, Tau = 0.098) intelligence of the infected students, decreased with decreasing concentration of
anti-CMV antibodies (a proxy of the time passed from the moment of infection). The observed higher
cognitive performance of infected subjects suggests that more intelligent people, who have more
social and sexual contacts, might have a higher risk of encountering CMV infection. On the other
hand, the positive correlation between cognitive performance and concentration of anti-CMV
antibodies suggests that latent infection with CMV has a cumulative negative effect on the cognitive
performance of humans. The prevalence of CMV infection in all countries is very high, sometimes
approaching 90%. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human cognitive performance may be large.",1
"Abstract
Objective. To assess if body mass index (BMI) and high waist circumference (HWC) are associated with testing positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods. 9,386 UK Biobank study participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16th 2020 to June 29th 2020 were analyzed. A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction between age and HWC. Results. Approximately 17% (n = 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17). For participants ≥65 years, only obesity class II (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10–1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight. While HWC was not associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in those <65 years, having an HWC was associated with an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in participants ≥65 years (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.27). Conclusion. The associations of BMI and HWC with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 differed by age. Notably, HWC was associated with testing positive in those ≥65 years, but not those who were younger, independent of BMI. This suggests that measures of adiposity in addition to BMI may be used to identify older individuals at greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.",1
"Abstract
Introduction Cognitive dysfunction is an important comorbidity of diabetes. Insulin resistance may play a critical role in diabetes-related cognitive impairment. Echinacoside (ECH), a natural phenylethanoid glycoside, is the active component of anti-diabetes prescriptions in traditional Chinese medicine. Its effect on modulating insulin resistance has been confirmed but modulating neurodegenerative disease remains unclear.

Methods Db/db mice, a spontaneous type 2 diabetes mode, were intragastrically administered ECH by 300 mg/kg or an equivalent volume of saline. Weight, blood glucose, and insulin resistance index were measured. Morris water maze test was performed to observe the compound effects on cognition. Hippocampal lesions were observed by histochemical analysis.

Results In db/db mice, ECH alleviated diabetes symptoms, memory loss, and hippocampal neuronal damage. Next, the expression of CD44 and phosphorylated tau was upregulated in diabetic mice. In addition, the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase B signaling pathway was dysregulated in diabetic mice. All these dysregulations could be reversed by ECH.

Discussion This study provides theoretical support and experimental evidence for the future application of ECH in diabetic cognition dysfunction treatment, promoting the development of traditional medicines.

Significance Statement 
Iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are currently recommended for treating anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD. However, safety concerns with ESAs have encouraged the development of alternative treatments for anemia. The phase 3 ROCKIES study is an international study of roxadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, compared with epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia of DD-CKD. Roxadustat was noninferior to epoetin alfa in increasing hemoglobin and reducing red blood cell transfusion, and reduced intravenous iron supplementation. Roxadustat was generally well tolerated and had an adverse event profile comparable to epoetin alfa. These results indicate that oral roxadustat is an effective alternative to parenteral ESA for the management of anemia in patients with DD-CKD.

Background 
Concerns regarding cardiovascular safety with current treatments for anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD have encouraged the development of alternatives. Roxadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, stimulates erythropoiesis by increasing endogenous erythropoietin and iron availability.

Methods 
In this open-label phase 3 study, patients with DD-CKD and anemia were randomized 1:1 to oral roxadustat three times weekly or parenteral epoetin alfa per local clinic practice. Initial roxadustat dose depended on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose at screening for patients already on them and was weight-based for those not on them. The primary efficacy end point was mean hemoglobin change from baseline averaged over weeks 28‒52 for roxadustat versus epoetin alfa, regardless of rescue therapy use, tested for noninferiority (margin, −0.75 g/dl). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed.

Results 
Among 2133 patients randomized (n=1068 roxadustat, n=1065 epoetin alfa), mean age was 54.0 years, and 89.1% and 10.8% were on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively. Mean (95% confidence interval) hemoglobin change from baseline was 0.77 (0.69 to 0.85) g/dl with roxadustat and 0.68 (0.60 to 0.76) g/dl with epoetin alfa, demonstrating noninferiority (least squares mean difference [95% CI], 0.09 [0.01 to 0.18]; P<0.001). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥1 AE and ≥1 serious AE was 85.0% and 57.6% with roxadustat and 84.5% and 57.5% with epoetin alfa, respectively.

Conclusions 
Roxadustat effectively increased hemoglobin in patients with DD-CKD, with an AE profile comparable to epoetin alfa.",1
"Ischemic stroke can induce rapid activation of the microglia. It has been reported that the microglia’s survival is dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling and that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R leads to morphological changes in the microglia in the healthy brain. However, the impact of CSF1R inhibition on neuronal structures and motor ability after ischemia–reperfusion remains unclear. In this study, we investigated microglial de-ramification, proliferation, and activation after inhibition of CSF1R by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ki20227) in a mouse model of global cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCAL). In addition to microglial morphology, we evaluated the mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory receptors. Our results show that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R in ischemic mice resulted in the blockade of microglial proliferation and a shift in microglial morphology reflected by excessive de-ramification and a more activated phenotype accompanied by an enhanced innate immune response. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R in ischemic mice resulted in the aggravation of neuronal degeneration and behavioral impairment. Intravital two-photon imaging revealed that although pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R did not affect the recovery of dendritic structures, it caused a significant increase in spine elimination during reperfusion in ischemic mice. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R induces a blockade of microglial proliferation and causes acute activation of the microglia accompanied by a severe inflammatory response. It aggravates neuronal degeneration, loss of dendritic spines, and behavioral deficits after transient global cerebral ischemia.",1
"Abstract
Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is currently recognized as a crucial mechanism of the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Kangxianling (KXL, anti-fibrin) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been proven to significantly reduce the levels of ECM deposition and inhibit renal fibrosis. To characterize the mechanisms and drug targets of KXL, we established a RIF rat model and treated the rats with KXL and losartan. Histological analyses validated the establishment of the RIF model and the treatment effect of KXL. Multiple levels of transcriptomic datasets were generated using lncRNA, mRNA and microRNA sequencing of kidney tissues. Functional annotations and pathway analyses were performed to unravel the therapeutic mechanisms. A multi-level transcriptomic regulatory network was built to illustrate the core factors in fibrosis pathogenesis and therapeutic regulation. KXL and losartan significantly reduced the progression of RIF, and a better therapeutic effect was shown with higher concentrations of KXL. According to the cluster analysis results of the RNA-seq data, the normal control (NC) and high concentration of KXL (HK) treatment groups were the closest in terms of differentially expressed genes. The WNT, TGF-β and MAPK pathways were enriched and dominated the pathogenesis and therapy of RIF. miR-15b, miR-21, and miR-6216 were upregulated and miR-107 was downregulated in the fibrosis model. These small RNAs were shown to play critical roles in the regulation of the above fibrosis-related genes and could be inhibited by KXL treatment. Finally, based on the lncRNA datasets, we constructed a mRNA-lncRNA-miRNA coexpression ceRNA network, which identified key regulatory factors in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis and therapeutic mechanisms of KXL. Our work revealed the potential mechanism of the Chinese medicine Kangxianling in inhibiting renal interstitial fibrosis and supported the clinical use of KXL in the treatment of kidney fibrosis.",1
"Abstract
Retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye cancer, has hereditary and non-hereditary forms. While TNM classification helps in prognosis, understanding molecular mechanisms is vital for the clinical behavior of retinoblastoma prediction. Our study aimed to analyze the expression levels of key Wnt pathway proteins, GSK3β, LEF1, β-catenin, and DVL1, and associate them to non-phosphorylated active form (pRb) and the phosphorylated inactive form (ppRb) and N-myc expression, in retinoblastoma cells and healthy retinal cells, in order to elucidate their roles in retinoblastoma and identify potential targets that could help to improve diagnostic and therapy. Specimens from 22 retinoblastoma cases (unilateral, bilateral, and trilateral) were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry assessed proteins’ expressions, followed by semi-quantitative analysis using the Immunoreactivity Score (IRS). Bayesian statistical methods were employed for data analysis. The study revealed various expression patterns of Wnt signaling proteins across different retinoblastoma types. The high expression levels were observed for LEF1 and DVL1. Inactive GSK3β and nuclear localization of β-catenin indicated Wnt signaling activation. The levels of inactive ppRb were significantly higher in retinoblastoma compared to healthy retina, as well as the levels of inactive GSK3β. Positive correlations between DVL1 and N-myc, GSK3β Y216 and GSK3β S9 and non-P β-catenin and LEF1 were established. Retinoblastomas without germline mutations (RB1+/+) exhibited high pRb, N-myc, and LEF1 levels, while those in genetically predisposed children (RB1+/-) showed lower expression of these proteins. Trilateral retinoblastomas demonstrated especially high N-myc and LEF1, but low pRb and ppRb levels. The findings highlight the meaningful role of the Wnt signaling pathway in retinoblastoma pathogenesis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets. Understanding molecular features may pave the way for personalized treatments and improve outcomes for retinoblastoma patients.",1

Objective
Long non-coding RNA breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) has been recognized as a proto-oncogene in various malignancies. It has been reported to be highly expressed and promote cell proliferation in glioma. However, its additional roles in gliomagenesis remain largely unclear. This research intends to investigate the impact and internal molecular mechanism of BCAR4 on glioma cell growth, invasion and tumorigenesis.

Methods
BCAR4 expression was examined by qPCR in 30 cases of graded glioma specimens and 7 glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines compared with respective controls. Its potential prognostic value was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. The biological roles of BCAR4 in gliomagenesis were verified by CCK-8, transwell and intracranial xenograft assays successively. qPCR and RNA pull-down assays were applied to study the relationship between BCAR4 and miR-2276. Then, qPCR, Western blot and luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the targeting of matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) by miR-2276 and the regulation of MMP7 by BCAR4. Finally, MMP7 was restored in BCAR4-silenced GBM cells and the rescue effects were determined by CCK-8 and transwell assays.

Results
BCAR4 expression was increased in glioma tissues and GBM cell lines, and its high expression positively correlated with advanced grades and worse prognosis. Functional assays verified that knockdown of BCAR4-inhibited cell growth and invasion in vitro, and impaired tumor formation in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that BCAR4 could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by targeting miR-2276 to upregulate MMP7 expression. Importantly, MMP7 restoration effectively rescued the inhibitory modulations on GBM cell growth and invasion caused by BCAR4 knockdown.

Conclusion
Our findings identified the essential roles of the BCAR4/miR-2276/MMP7 axis in gliomagenesis and provided novel insights on glioma therapy.",1
"Abstract
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most aggressive type of head and neck cancer with an unsatisfactory 5-year survival rate. MicroRNAs are a group of small noncoding RNAs reported to serve important roles in carcinogenesis, inhibiting certain gene expression via targeting the 3′-untranslated region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). MiR-4282 has been newly discovered to be a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, but it has never been studied in OSCC. The present study aimed to uncover the role of miR-4282 in OSCC. We first confirmed that miR-4282 was downregulated in OSCC and validated its prognostic significance. Through gain-of-function assays, miR-4282 was discovered to inhibit proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and induce apoptosis. By mechanistic research, we predicted via bioinformatics tools and confirmed by luciferase reporter and pulldown assays that miR-4282 targeted LIN28B, an RNA-binding protein, which has been reported to regulate RNA stability in cancers. Furthermore, we confirmed the interaction between LIN28B and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 2 (ZBTB2), and validated that miR-4282 regulated mRNA stability of ZBTB2 by inhibiting LIN28B. Rescue assays proved that miR-4282 inhibited tumor progression through LIN28B/ZBTB2 axis. In vivo assays proved that miR-4282 inhibited tumor growth in OSCC. In conclusion, the present study revealed that miR-4282 inhibited tumor progression through downregulation of ZBTB2 by targeting LIN28B in OSCC cells, indicating miR-4282 as a novel biomarker for OSC.",1
"Abstract
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the NOTCH pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage. There is currently no information on the role of the Delta-like homologue 1 (DLK1), a NOTCH inhibitor, in the regulation of renal damage. Here, we investigated the contribution of DLK1 to experimental renal damage and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a Dlk1-null mouse model in the experimental renal damage of unilateral ureteral obstruction, we found activation of NOTCH, as shown by increased nuclear translocation of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain, and upregulation of Dlk2/hey-1 expression compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. NOTCH1 over-activation in Dlk1-null injured kidneys was associated with a higher inflammatory response, characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly CD4/IL17A + lymphocytes, and activation of the Th17 immune response. Furthermore, pharmacological NOTCH blockade inhibited the transcription factors controlling Th17 differentiation and gene expression of the Th17 effector cytokine IL-17A and other related-inflammatory factors, linked to a diminution of inflammation in the injured kidneys. We propose that the non-canonical NOTCH ligand DLK1 acts as a NOTCH antagonist in renal injury regulating the Th17-mediated inflammatory response.",1

Objective—
Effective postinfarction repair requires timely suppression of innate immune signals to prevent the catastrophic consequences of uncontrolled inflammation on cardiac geometry and function. In macrophages, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M acts as a functional decoy preventing uncontrolled toll-like receptor /interleukin-1–mediated responses. Our study investigates the role of IRAK-M as a negative regulator of the postinfarction inflammatory response and as a modulator of cardiac remodeling.
Methods and Results—
In wild-type mouse infarcts IRAK-M was upregulated in infiltrating macrophages and fibroblasts exhibiting a biphasic response. When compared with wild-type animals, infarcted IRAK-M−/− mice had enhanced adverse remodeling and worse systolic dysfunction; however, acute infarct size was comparable between groups. Adverse remodeling in IRAK-M−/− animals was associated with enhanced myocardial inflammation and protease activation. The protective actions of IRAK-M involved phenotypic modulation of macrophages and fibroblasts. IRAK-M−/− infarcts showed increased infiltration with proinflammatory CD11b+/Ly6Chi monocytes; leukocytes harvested from IRAK-M−null infarcts exhibited accentuated cytokine expression. In vitro, IRAK-M expression was upregulated in cytokine-stimulated murine cardiac fibroblasts and suppressed their matrix-degrading properties without affecting their inflammatory activity.
Conclusion—
Endogenous IRAK-M attenuates adverse postinfarction remodeling suppressing leukocyte inflammatory activity, while inhibiting fibroblast-mediated matrix degradation.",1
"Abstract
Purpose:
The purpose of this study was to establish a method to perform multidimensional radiochromic film measurements of 106Ru plaques and to benchmark the resulting dose distributions against Monte Carlo simulations (MC), microdiamond, and diode measurements.

Methods:
Absolute dose rates and relative dose distributions in multiple planes were determined for three different plaque models (CCB, CCA, and COB), and three different plaques per model, using EBT3 films in an in-house developed polystyrene phantom and the mcnp6 MC code. Dose difference maps were generated to analyze interplaque variations for a specific type, and for comparing measurements against MC simulations. Furthermore, dose distributions were validated against values specified by the manufacturer (BEBIG) and microdiamond and diode measurements in a water scanning phantom. Radial profiles were assessed and used to estimate dosimetric margins for a given combination of representative tumor geometry and plaque size.

Results:
Absolute dose rates at a reference depth of 2 mm on the central axis of the plaque show an agreement better than 5% (10%) when comparing film measurements (mcnp6) to the manufacturer's data. The reproducibility of depth-dose profile measurements was <7% (2 SD) for all investigated detectors and plaque types. Dose difference maps revealed minor interplaque deviations for a specific plaque type due to inhomogeneities of the active layer. The evaluation of dosimetric margins showed that for a majority of the investigated cases, the tumor was not completely covered by the 100% isodose prescribed to the tumor apex if the difference between geometrical plaque size and tumor base ≤4 mm.

Conclusions:
EBT3 film dosimetry in an in-house developed phantom was successfully used to characterize the dosimetric properties of different 106Ru plaque models. The film measurements were validated against MC calculations and other experimental methods and showed a good agreement with data from BEBIG well within published tolerances. The dosimetric information as well as interplaque comparison can be used for comprehensive quality assurance and for considerations in the treatment planning of ophthalmic brachytherapy.",1
"Rationale and Objective
The goal of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead (DEB) transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with apatinib administration in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Materials and Methods
From December 2015 to May 2017, a total of 32 patients with advanced HCC treated with DEB-TACE combined with apatinib were consecutively enrolled in this study. The treatment response and laboratory outcomes were assessed at the first- and third month after DEB-TACE therapy. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were also analyzed and assessed.
Results
The objective response rate and disease control rate were 62.5% and 96.9% at the first month after treatment, respectively. At the third month after the first therapy, a slightly higher objective response rate (68.8%) and lower disease control rate (90.6%) were achieved. There were no differences in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum albumin, or total bilirubin at M1 or M3 compared to M0 (all p> 0.05) The median progression-free survival was 9.5 months (95% confidence interval, 8.1–10.9 months), and the median overall survival was 22.0 months (95% confidence interval, 20.2–23.9 months). Among the 32 patients, 2 had hypertension and 1 had grade 3 diarrhea; the rest of the patients had mild to moderate adverse reactions that were acceptable, and no serious adverse reactions occurred.
Conclusion
DEB-TACE combined with apatinib is a safe and promising treatment approach for patients with advanced HCC.",1
"Abstract
Purpose
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of robotic-assisted (RA-) approach compared to the standard laparoscopic (L-) approach using the 2020 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) registry Public Use File (PUF). Our secondary objective is to establish standards for the reporting of outcomes using PUF.

Materials and Methods
Using the PUF database (n = 168,568), patients were divided into sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), revisions, and conversions and then analyzed separately. We created balanced covariate through propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW). We also conducted multivariable relative risk regression to confirm our results.

Results
For RYGB, the incidence of “transfusion” was significantly lower in the RA-RYGB compared to the L-RYGB. There was no significant difference in the rate of Serious Event Occurrences (SEOs) or rate of intervention at 30 days. For SG, there was a higher rate of “transfusion” in the RA group. Incidence of SEOs was also significantly higher in the RA-group. There was no significant difference in SEOs for conversions; however, revisions had a trend toward a lower rate of SEOs favoring the robotic approach. Operative times were significantly higher for all RA-groups.

Conclusion
RA- approach in metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) remains controversial because of differences in outcomes. The use of SEOs as reported by MBSAQIP in its semi-annual report can be used as a composite score to assess outcomes while using PUF. Further studies are needed to compare RA- to L- MBS.

Background
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19 patients based on current peer-reviewed RCTs and to address disputes over the existing evidence.

Methods
MEDLINE (Pubmed), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library, Google scholar and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for RCTs assessing the efficacy of Ivermectin up to 20 February 2022. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies was performed based on the PRISMA 2020 statement criteria.

Results
19 and 17 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. There was no significant difference in progression to severe disease (log OR − 0.27 [95% CI − 0.61 to 0.08], I2 = 42.29%), negative RT-PCR (log OR 0.25 [95% CI − 0.18–0.68], I2 = 58.73%), recovery (log OR 0.11 [95% CI − 0.22–0.45], I2 = 13.84%), duration of hospitalization (SMD − 0.40 [95% CI − 0.85–0.06], I2 = 88.90%), time to negative RT-PCR (SMD − 0.36 [95% CI − 0.89–0.17], I2 = 46.2%), and viral load (SMD -0.17 [95% CI -0.45 to 0.12], I^2 = 0%). It is worth noting that, based on low-certainty evidence, ivermectin may possibly reduce mortality (log OR − 0.67 [95% CI − 1.20 to − 0.13], I2 = 28.96%). However, studies with a higher risk of bias were more likely to indicate positive effects on the efficacy of this drug, according to our subgroup analyses based on study quality.

Conclusion
Ivermectin did not have any significant effect on outcomes of COVID-19 patients and as WHO recommends, use of ivermectin should be limited to clinical trials.",1
"Abstract
Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are a family of protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues. DUSPs are de-regulated in many human diseases, including cancers. However, the function of DUSPs in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, using short hairpin RNA-based gene knockdown, we found that several members of the DUSP family play critical roles in regulating cell proliferation. In particular, we showed that DUSP16 ablation leads to a G1/S transition arrest, reduced incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Mechanistically, DUSP16 silencing causes cellular senescence by activating the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb. The phosphatase activity of DUSP16 is necessary for antagonizing cellular senescence. Importantly, the expression levels of DUSP16 are up-regulated in human liver cancers, and are positively correlated with tumor cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings indicate that DUSP16 plays a role in tumorigenesis by protecting cancer cells from senescence.",1

Background: The purpose of this paper is to explore the mechanism of aerobic exercise regulating autophagy through the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and its participation in apoptosis, to protect the hippocampal nerves from damage in vascular dementia rats. Methods: Thirty-six healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into a sham group, a model group, and a model exercise group. A neurobehavioral assessment was used to determine the memory and exploration abilities of the rats. A TUNEL assay was used to detect hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were used to analyze LC3Ⅱ and the beclin-1 protein. An RT-PCR detected the differential expression of mRNA. Results: The results of the neurobehavioral tests showed that the platform latency time of the rats with vascular dementia was prolonged. Aerobic exercise significantly shortens the swimming time of rats in platform latency. The TUNEL results showed that the TUNEL-positive cells of the hippocampal neurons in the model group increased; the expression of pro-apoptotic genes caspase-3 and Bax mRNA was up-regulated, and the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA was down-regulated. Aerobic exercise reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, up-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA, and down-regulated caspase-3 and Bax mRNA. The LC3Ⅱ and Beclin-1 proteins, detected by immunohistochemistry and a Western blot analysis, showed that the protein expression in the hippocampi of rats with vascular dementia increased. Aerobic exercise reduced LC3Ⅱ and Beclin-1 protein expression. The results of the RT-PCR showed similar changes. Conclusions: Aerobic exercise could improve the learning and memory abilities of vascular dementia rats, moderately regulate the process of autophagy, reduce the TUNEL-positive cells of hippocampal neurons, repair damaged hippocampal neurons by regulating the autophagy signaling pathway PI3K/Akt-mTOR, and improve hippocampal function.

"Abstract
Simulations of coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics in molecules can be quite challenging due
to the involved interplay of the many degrees of freedom. Because a full quantum treatment of both
electrons and nuclei is computationally very demanding, it is generally restricted to model systems
or rather small molecules and short timescales. Mixed quantum-classical dynamics methods such as
Tully’s fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) can be used to overcome this limitation. However,
FSSH is known to poorly describe electronic coherences and decoherence phenomena.
Here, we present a new approach that combines FSSH with ring polymer molecular dynamics
(RPMD) in a specific way that aims to alleviate the coherence problem. Termed ring polymer
surface hopping - density matrix approach (RPSH-DM), this new method uses an electronic density
matrix formulation to calculate surface hopping rates. This incorporates decoherence effects into
FSSH in a natural way by taking into account the spatial spreading of the ring polymer that mimics
the width of a nuclear wave packet in each RPMD trajectory. By applying our new method to
Tully’s one dimensional model system, we demonstrate this method captures a crucial decoherence
mechanism that is missing in FSSH. Furthermore, our method turns out to be superior at describing
electronic coherences to earlier attempts at combining of RPMD and FSSH.",1
"Abstract
Werner syndrome is caused by mutations in the DNA repair Werner helicase (WRN) gene and characterized by accelerated aging including cataracts. Age-related cataract (ARC) cases (N = 504) and controls (N = 244) were recruited from a population-based study to evaluate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of WRN and another DNA repair gene (human 8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1) with ARC. Among the five SNPs tested, only WRN rs1346044 was found to be significantly associated between cases and controls before multiple-testing adjustment. The minor C allele of rs1346044 was associated with ARC with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.66, suggesting a protective role of the C allele for developing ARC. The stratification analysis on the subtypes of ARC showed that rs1346044 was significantly associated with cortical cataract, but not with nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and mixed types after multiple-testing adjustment (OR = 0.51, p< 0.01). The genetic model analysis showed that the results fit the dominant model (OR = 0.44, p < 0.001). The comet assay used to assess the extent of DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes of ARC cases found that the DNA damage in lymphocytes from patients with CC genotype was significantly less than that in patients with TT genotype. We concluded that the C allele of rs1346044, a non-synonymous SNP resulting in the conversion of Cys to Arg at amino acid position 1367 of WRN, alters susceptibility to ARC, especially the cortical type of the disease, in the Han Chinese. The underlying mechanism of its protective role might be related to the improved DNA repair function.",1
"Abstract
Objective
This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies in COVID-19 patients.

Methods
We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases until July 27, 2022. Both randomized control trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were included and analyzed separately. The outcomes included mortality, incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), ventilation improvement rate (need oxygen therapy to without oxygen therapy), secondary infection, and adverse events (AEs). The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by a random-effects meta-analysis model.

Results
Five RCTs and 2 cohort studies with 1726 COVID-19 patients were recruited (n = 866 in the GM-CSF antibody group and n = 891 in the control group). GM-CSF antibodies treatment reduced the incidence of IMV, which was supported by two cohort studies (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.03, 0.74) and three RCTs (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41, 0.94). GM-CSF antibodies resulted in slight but not significant reductions in mortality (based on two cohort studies and five RCTs) and ventilation improvement (based on one cohort study and two RCTs). The sensitive analysis further showed the results of mortality and ventilation improvement rate became statistically significant when one included study was removed. Besides, GM-CSF antibodies did not increase the risks of the second infection (based on one cohort study and five RCTs) and AEs (based on five RCTs).

Conclusion
GM-CSF antibody treatments may be an efficacious and well-tolerant way for the treatment of COVID-19. Further clinical evidence is still warranted.",1

Favipiravir is considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 due its efficacy against different viral infections. We aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 mild and moderate cases. It was randomized-controlled open-label interventional phase 3 clinical trial [NCT04349241]. 100 patients were recruited from 18th April till 18th May. 50 patients received favipiravir 3200 mg at day 1 followed by 600 mg twice (day 2–day 10). 50 patients received hydroxychloroquine 800 mg at day 1 followed by 200 mg twice (day 2–10) and oral oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h/day for 10 days. Patients were enrolled from Ain Shams University Hospital and Assiut University Hospital. Both arms were comparable as regards demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The average onset of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was 8.1 and 8.3 days in HCQ-arm and favipiravir-arm respectively. 55.1% of those on HCQ-arm turned PCR negative at/or before 7th day from diagnosis compared to 48% in favipiravir-arm (p = 0.7). 4 patients in FVP arm developed transient transaminitis on the other hand heartburn and nausea were reported in about 20 patients in HCQ-arm. Only one patient in HCQ-arm died after developing acute myocarditis resulted in acute heart failure. Favipiravir is a safe effective alternative for hydroxychloroquine in mild or moderate COVID-19 infected patients.

"Abstract
Epigenetic clocks are calculated by combining DNA methylation states across select CpG sites to estimate biologic age, and have been noted as the most successful markers of biologic aging to date. Yet, limited research has considered epigenetic clocks calculated in brain tissue. We used DNA methylation states in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens from 721 older participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, to calculate DNA methylation age using four established epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and a new Cortical clock. The four established clocks were trained in blood samples (Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge) or using 51 human tissue and cell types (Horvath); the recent Cortical clock is the first trained in postmortem cortical tissue. Participants were recruited beginning in 1994 (Religious Orders Study) and 1997 (Memory and Aging Project), and followed annually with questionnaires and clinical evaluations; brain specimens were obtained for 80–90% of participants. Mean age at death was 88.0 (SD 6.7) years. We used linear regression, logistic regression, and linear mixed models, to examine relations of epigenetic clock ages to neuropathologic and clinical aging phenotypes, controlling for chronologic age, sex, education, and depressive symptomatology.
Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and Cortical clock ages were related to pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to Aβ load (a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease). However, associations were substantially stronger for the Cortical than other clocks; for example, each standard deviation (SD) increase in Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge clock age was related to approximately 30% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (all p < 0.05), while each SD increase in Cortical age was related to 90% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.38, 2.62). Moreover, Cortical age was significantly related to other AD pathology (eg, mean tau tangle density, p = 0.003), and to odds of neocortical Lewy body pathology (for each SD increase in Cortical age, odds ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence 1.27, 3.17), although no clocks were related to cerebrovascular neuropathology. Cortical age was the only epigenetic clock significantly associated with the clinical phenotypes examined, from dementia to cognitive decline (5 specific cognitive systems, and a global cognitive measure averaging 17 tasks) to Parkinsonian signs. Overall, our findings provide evidence of the critical necessity for bespoke clocks of brain aging for advancing research to understand, and eventually prevent, neurodegenerative diseases of aging.",1
"Abstract
Excessive alcohol drinking has been shown to modify brain circuitry to predispose individuals for future alcohol abuse. Previous studies have implicated the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) as an important site for mediating the somatic symptoms of withdrawal and for regulating alcohol intake. In addition, recent work has established a role for both the Kappa Opioid Receptor (KOR) and its endogenous ligand dynorphin in mediating these processes. However, it is unclear whether these effects are due to dynorphin or KOR arising from within the CeA itself or other input brain regions. To directly examine the role of preprodynorphin (PDYN) and KOR expression in CeA neurons, we performed region-specific conditional knockout of these genes and assessed the effects on the Drinking in the Dark (DID) and Intermittent Access (IA) paradigms. Conditional gene knockout resulted in sex-specific responses wherein PDYN knockout decreased alcohol drinking in both male and female mice, whereas KOR knockout decreased drinking in males only. We also found that neither PDYN nor KOR knockout protected against anxiety caused by alcohol drinking. Lastly, a history of alcohol drinking did not alter synaptic transmission in PDYN neurons in the CeA of either sex, but excitability of PDYN neurons was increased in male mice only. Taken together, our findings indicate that PDYN and KOR signaling in the CeA plays an important role in regulating excessive alcohol consumption and highlight the need for future studies to examine how this is mediated through downstream effector regions.",1
"Abstract
Nitrile hydratase (NHase) is an important industrial enzyme that biosynthesizes high-value amides. However, most of NHases expressed in Escherichia coli easily aggregate to inactive inclusion bodies unless the induction temperature is reduced to approximately 20 °C. The NHase from Aurantimonas manganoxydans has been functionally expressed in E. coli, and exhibits considerable potential for the production of nicotinamide in industrial application. In this study, the effects of chaperones including GroEL/ES, Dnak/J-GrpE and trigger factor on the expression of the recombinant Co-type NHase were investigated. The results indicate that three chaperones can significantly promote the active expression of the recombinant NHase at 30 °C. The total NHase activities reached to 263 and 155 U/ml in shake flasks when the NHase was co-expressed with GroEL/ES and DnaK/J-GrpE, which were 52- and 31-fold higher than the observed activities without chaperones, respectively. This increase is possibly due to the soluble expression of the recombinant NHase assisted by molecular chaperones. Furthermore, GroEL/ES and DnaK/J-GrpE were determined to promote the maturation of the Co-type NHase in E. coli under the absence of the parental activator gene. These knowledge regarding the chaperones effect on the NHase expression are useful for understanding the biosynthesis of Co-type NHase.",1
"Abstract
Periodontal disease – PD – is one of the most widespread diseases in dogs, but the role of this odontogenic infection in the dissemination of pathogenic bacteria present in the oral mucosa to other animals or pet owners is understudied.
Trying to unveil the putative pathogenicity of enterococci present in the gums of dogs diagnosed with PD, thirty-two animals were investigated during routine visits to a private veterinary clinic. Seventy-one enterococci were recovered and characterized regarding species, genomic variability, virulence traits, antimicrobial resistance and biofilm-forming ability.
Isolates were mainly identified as Enterococcus faecalis, with the large majority (95%) being able to produce biofilm. Regarding antibiotic resistance, all dog-enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, gentamicin-120, imipenem and vancomycin; while distinct levels of resistance were observed for chloramphenicol (10%), erythromycin (20%), streptomycin-300 (35%) and tetracycline (95%).
For virulence traits incidence levels of 35% were observed for β-hemolysis and 25% for cylA, 25% for gelatinase and 35% for gelE; 85% harbor efaAfs and ebpABC; while ace, agg and esp are present respectively in 50, 30 and 10% of the dog-enterococci; efaAfm and acm were detected in all the Enterococcus faecium.
Overall, the widespread prevalence of PD in dogs, associated with the close contact between companion animals, other animals and humans, may act as source for the dissemination of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. Hence, aforementioned data on virulence and resistance features, emphasizes the need for active surveillance measures, such as the diagnose of PD in companion animals during routine visits to the veterinary clinic.",1

Exosomes mediate cell-cell crosstalk in cancer progression by transferring their molecular cargos, including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Metastasis‑associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a well-known lncRNA associated with cancer angiogenesis and metastasis. However, the presence of MALAT1 in exosomes and the roles and clinical values of exosomal MALAT1 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remain unknown. The present study focused on the crosstalk between EOC cells and endothelial cells mediated by exosomal MALAT1 and aimed to explore the roles of exosomes and exosomal MALAT1 in EOC angiogenesis and to reveal the clinical relevance and prognostic predictive value of serum exosomal MALAT1 in EOC. We observed that MALAT1 was increased in both metastatic EOC cells and their secreted exosomes. Exosomal MALAT1 derived from EOC cells was transferred to recipient human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via exosomes. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that MALAT1 knockdown impaired the exosome-mediated proangiogenic activity of HUVECs through certain key angiogenesis-related genes. Clinically, elevated serum exosomal MALAT1 was highly correlated with an advanced and metastatic phenotype of EOC and was an independent predictive factor for EOC overall survival (OS). Moreover, a prognostic nomogram model we constructed showed a good prediction of the probability of 3-year OS of EOC patients according to the c-index (0.751, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.691-0.811) and calibration curve. Collectively, our data provide a novel mechanism by which EOC cells transfer MALAT1 via exosomes to recipient HUVECs and influence HUVECs by stimulating angiogenesis-related gene expression, eventually promoting angiogenesis. Additionally, circulating exosomal MALAT1 can serve as a promising serum-based, noninvasive predictive biomarker for EOC prognosis.

"ABSTRACT: Controlling mechanical properties of ordered organic
materials remains a formidable challenge, despite their great potential for
high performance mechanical actuators, transistors, solar cells, photonics, and
bioelectronics. Here we demonstrate a crystal engineering approach to design
mechanically reconfigurable, plastically flexible single crystals (of about 10) of
three unrelated types of compounds by introducing active slip planes in
structures via different noninterfering supramolecular weak interactions,
namely van der Waals (vdW), π-stacking, and hydrogen bonding groups.
Spherical hydrophobic groups, which assemble via shape complementarity
(shape synthons), reliably form low energy slip planes, thus facilitating an
impressive mechanical flexibility, which allowed molding the crystals into
alphabetical characters to spell out “organiccrystal”. The study, which
reports the preparation of a series of exotic plastic crystals by design for the
first time, demonstrates the potential of soft interactions for tuning the
mechanical behavior of ordered molecular materials, including those from π-conjugated systems.",1

Purpose: Femoral neck fracture treatment in young adults remains controversial. Cannulated screws (CS) and femoral neck system (FNS) are well-accepted methods for femoral neck fracture treatment; however, these methods are associated with complications. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relative safety and effectiveness of CS and FNS for treating young patients with femoral neck fractures. Methods: We searched the following sources for studies that compared CS and FNS fixation: Cochrane library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine disc, and Chinese Science and Technology Journals. The outcomes were surgical and prognostic results and complications. Results: This meta-analysis included eight studies. The pooled results revealed that the two fixation methods were similar in terms of the operation time, length of hospital stay, healing time, intraoperative blood loss, non-union, femoral head necrosis, and internal fixation cut-out. Compared with CS fixation, FNS fixation required fewer intraoperative fluoroscopies and had better Harris Hip Score, earlier weight-bearing, lower number of total complications, lesser femoral neck shortening, and lesser extent of nail retreat. Conclusion: FNS fixation outperforms CS fixation in terms of intraoperative fluoroscopies, Harris Hip Score, and morbidity in young patients with femoral neck fractures. Clinicians should consider FNS as a first choice in treating femoral neck fracture in young adults, except where this approach is contraindicated.

The present study examined the roles of word concreteness and word valence in the immediate serial recall task.
Emotion words (e.g. happy) were used to investigate these
effects. Participants completed study-test trials with 7-item
study lists consisting of positive or negative words with either high or low concreteness (Experiments 1 and 2) and
neutral (i.e. non-emotion) words with either high or low
concreteness (Experiment 2). In serial recall performance,
we replicated the typical item concreteness effect (concrete
words are better recalled than abstract words) and obtained
an item valence effect (positive/neutral words are better
recalled than negative words). However, there was no concreteness × valence interaction. We conclude that both word
valence and word concreteness independently contribute to
the serial order retention of emotion words in the immediate
serial recall task.

"Abstract
Eskine, Kacinik, and Prinz’s (2011) influential experiment demonstrated that gustatory disgust triggers a heightened sense of moral wrongness. We report a large-scale multisite direct replication of this study conducted by labs in the Collaborative Replications and Education Project. Subjects in each sample were randomly assigned to one of three beverage conditions: bitter (disgusting), control (neutral), or sweet. Then, subjects made a series of judgments about the moral wrongness of the behavior depicted in six vignettes. In the original study (N = 57), drinking the bitter beverage led to higher ratings of moral wrongness than did drinking the control or sweet beverage; a contrast between the bitter condition and the other two conditions was significant among conservative (n = 19) but not liberal (n = 25) subjects. In the current project, random-effects meta-analyses across all subjects (N = 1,137, k = 11 studies), conservative subjects (n = 142, k = 5), and liberal subjects (n = 635, k = 9) revealed standardized overall effect sizes across replications that were smaller than reported in the original study. Some were in the opposite of the predicted direction; all had 95% confidence intervals containing zero, and all were smaller than the effect size the original authors could have meaningfully detected. Results of linear mixed-effects regressions revealed that drinking the bitter beverage led to higher ratings of moral wrongness than did drinking the control beverage but not the sweet beverage. Bayes factor tests revealed greater relative support for the null than for the replication hypothesis. The overall pattern provides little to no support for the theory that physical disgust via taste perception harshens judgments of moral wrongness.",1
"Abstract
Importance  Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant that supports mitochondrial function, has been shown in preclinical Parkinson disease (PD) models to reduce the loss of dopamine neurons, and was safe and well tolerated in early-phase human studies. A previous phase II study suggested possible clinical benefit.

Objective  To examine whether CoQ10 could slow disease progression in early PD.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial at 67 North American sites consisting of participants 30 years of age or older who received a diagnosis of PD within 5 years and who had the following inclusion criteria: the presence of a rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity; a modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.5 or less; and no anticipated need for dopaminergic therapy within 3 months. Exclusion criteria included the use of any PD medication within 60 days, the use of any symptomatic PD medication for more than 90 days, atypical or drug-induced parkinsonism, a Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) rest tremor score of 3 or greater for any limb, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 25 or less, a history of stroke, the use of certain supplements, and substantial recent exposure to CoQ10. Of 696 participants screened, 78 were found to be ineligible, and 18 declined participation.

Interventions  The remaining 600 participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, or 2400 mg/d of CoQ10; all participants received 1200 IU/d of vitamin E.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Participants were observed for 16 months or until a disability requiring dopaminergic treatment. The prospectively defined primary outcome measure was the change in total UPDRS score (Parts I-III) from baseline to final visit. The study was powered to detect a 3-point difference between an active treatment and placebo.

Results  The baseline characteristics of the participants were well balanced, the mean age was 62.5 years, 66% of participants were male, and the mean baseline total UPDRS score was 22.7. A total of 267 participants required treatment (94 received placebo, 87 received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 86 received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10), and 65 participants (29 who received placebo, 19 who received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 17 who received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10) withdrew prematurely. Treatments were well tolerated with no safety concerns. The study was terminated after a prespecified futility criterion was reached. At study termination, both active treatment groups showed slight adverse trends relative to placebo. Adjusted mean changes (worsening) in total UPDRS scores from baseline to final visit were 6.9 points (placebo), 7.5 points (1200 mg/d of CoQ10; P = .49 relative to placebo), and 8.0 points (2400 mg/d of CoQ10; P = .21 relative to placebo).

Conclusions and Relevance  Coenzyme Q10 was safe and well tolerated in this population, but showed no evidence of clinical benefit.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder commonly resulting in the loss of motor function, in nonmotor symptoms, and in cognitive decline. It affects 4.1 to 4.6 million people worldwide, and its prevalence is predicted to more than double by 2030.1 Strong evidence has emerged that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD, providing a robust scientific rationale for testing potential “neuroprotectants” that target these processes.2-4 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a key component of the electron transport chain responsible for mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate generation, leads to decreased free radical generation, and, in its reduced form, acts as a powerful antioxidant.5 Coenzyme Q10 levels and redox status have been shown to be altered in individuals with PD,6 and CoQ10 has neuroprotective effects in multiple in vitro and animal models of neuronal toxicity, including the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model of PD.7 Finally, CoQ10 has shown promising clinical benefits in small human studies of progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington disease, and Friedreich ataxia.8-10

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase II study of CoQ10 in early PD examined the effects of 300, 600, and 1200 mg/d vs placebo (all dosages, including placebo, also contained 1200 IU of vitamin E). Eighty participants were observed for 16 months or until dopaminergic therapy was required, whichever came first.11 Coenzyme Q10 supplementation was associated with a trend toward decreased functional decline in participants (P = .09), as indicated by the change in total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score (Parts I-III) from baseline to last visit, and those assigned to receive 1200 mg/d of CoQ10 had a nominally significantly improved outcome (44% reduction) compared with those assigned to receive placebo (P = .04). Moreover, increased platelet mitochondrial complex I and II/III activities were demonstrated in participants assigned to receive CoQ10 vs those assigned to receive placebo (P = .04). Because CoQ10 is not known to provide symptomatic benefit,12 these results suggested a possible disease-modifying effect. The QE3 study was designed to test the hypothesis that a high dose of CoQ10 would slow functional decline in early PD.",1

The phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway appears to be a key regulator in cervical carcinogenesis. The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein is principally involved in the homeostatic maintenance of PI3K/Akt signaling and PTEN has been identified to play an important role in the occurrence and development of cervical cancer. MicroRNA (miRNA)‑494 has been proven to be involved in the carcinogenesis and development of various types of cancer by directly targeting PTEN. However the role, mechanism and clinical significance of miR‑494 in cervical cancer have not been further reported. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of miR‑494 in cervical cancer cell lines and clinical specimens by RT‑qPCR, and explored the association of miR‑494 with PTEN expression and clinicopathological data of cervical cancer patients. The results showed that miR‑494 expression was significantly upregulated in human cervical cancer cell lines and tissues. miR‑494 upregulation was significantly associated with PTEN downregulation, adverse clinicopathological characteristics, poor overall and progression‑free survival and poor prognosis. In vitro experiments showed that inhibition of miR‑494 suppressed cell proliferation and growth by directly targeting the 3'‑untranslated region (3'‑UTR) of PTEN mRNA. These findings identified a novel molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of PTEN expression and cervical cancer progression. Results of the present study indicated that miR‑494 may have an essential role in the carcinogenesis and progression of cervical cancer and targeting miR‑494 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cervical cancer.",1
"Abstract:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly regarded in Deep Learning (DL) and have shown promising results in medical image analysis, making them a leading model for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Their efficacy extends to the diagnosis of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s Disease (PD), which is typically identified through Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans. However, relying solely on visual inspection of SPECT images during medical examinations can introduce inaccuracies due to subjective factors. We propose a CAD system for automatic PD diagnosis using pre-trained CNN models, Transfer Learning (TL) technique, and the Bilinear Pooling method to address this issue. The study employs several CNN architectures, specifically Efficient-Net B0, and Mobile-Net V2 models, and a custom CNN architecture. These pre-trained architectures were originally trained on ImageNet and adapted to the current task using the TL technique. These architectures are leveraged with a bilinear pooling form, resulting in three Bilinear CNN (BCNN) models. These models are applied to pre-processed SPECT image data of PD patients and Healthy Controls (HC), categorized into three distinct datasets. The proposed method is evaluated on a total of 2720 SPECT images (1360 PD and 1360 HC subjects) obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The findings show that the BCNN EfficientNet-B0-MobileNet-V2 model achieved the highest accuracy score of 98.47%, surpassing other developed CNN models and outperforming existing methods. In conclusion, the proposed CAD system provides an efficient diagnostic tool to assist physicians in making accurate PD diagnoses, independent of subjective factors.",1
"This prospective clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of an ablation strategy, namely ‘2C3L’, in the treatment
of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF); and to compare its efficacy with that of the ‘stepwise’ approach, which has been
acknowledged as a promising ablation technique for persistent AF.
Methods
and results
The ‘2C3L’ technique is a fixed ablation approach consisting of bilateral circumferential pulmonary vein antrum isolation
(PVAI) and three linear ablation lesion sets across the mitral isthmus, left atrial roof, and cavo-tricuspid isthmus. One
hundred and forty-six patients with persistent AF were randomized to undergo ablation by using the ‘2C3L’ or the ‘stepwise’ technique (n ¼ 73, respectively). The primary endpoint was freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) after a single procedure at follow-up. Twelve months after a single procedure, there was no
difference in sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance rate between the two groups (67% for ‘2C3L’ vs. 60% for ‘stepwise’,
P ¼ 0.394; 95% confidence interval of between-group difference 28.7 to 22.4%). The procedure (222+42 vs.
263+41 min), fluoroscopy (41+9 vs. 55+8 min), and radiofrequency (RF) (107+32 vs. 128+38 min) time
were significantly shorter in the ‘2C3L’ group (all P , 0.001). At 25+5 months after the first procedure, 57.5 and
52.1% of patients from the ‘2C3L’ group and the ‘stepwise’ group were in SR off AAD (P ¼ 0.494), respectively.
Conclusions For catheter ablation of persistent AF, the ‘2C3L’ strategy is a fixed approach associated with clinical efficacy similar to that
of the ‘stepwise’ approach but with less RF delivery, fewer X-ray exposure, and shorter procedural time.

"Abstract
Advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the most malignant of all types of biliary tract cancers that is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Accumulating evidence suggest that the B7 family of proteins serve an essential role in various types of cancers, including GBC. However, the potential function and regulatory mechanism of human endogenous retrovirus‑H long terminal repeat‑associating protein 2 (HHLA2; also known as B7‑H7 or B7H5) in GBC remain poorly understood. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression pattern of HHLA2 in samples from 89 patients with GBC. The possible association between HHLA2 expression and the clinicopathological parameters, including prognosis, were then assessed. Using lentiviruses, overexpression of HHLA2 plasmid or short‑hairpin RNA (shRNA) of HHLA2 were transfected into GBC‑SD cells to overexpress or knock down HHLA2 expression, respectively. The effects of HHLA2 overexpression and knockdown on the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process on GBC‑SD cells were measured by the western blotting and immunofluorescence staining of collagen I, N‑cadherin, E‑cadherin, vimentin and α‑SMA. By contrast, changes in cell proliferation were measured using EdU assay. Cell invasion and migration were assessed using Transwell and wound‑healing assays, respectively. In addition, a xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the tumorigenic ability of the GBC cell line in vivo after stable transfection with lentivirus for HHLA2 overexpression or shRNA for HHLA2 knockdown. The regulatory relationships among TGF‑β1, long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 (H19) and HHLA2 were then investigated. The mRNA expression of lncRNA H19 were assessed using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, whereas the expression levels of HHLA2 were detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. HHLA2 expression was found to gradually increase as the stages of the GBC samples become more advanced. In addition, the expression level of HHLA2 was calculated to be positively associated with the Nevin stage, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, tumor invasion and regional lymph node metastasis but was negatively associated with the overall patient survival (OS). In vitro experiments demonstrated that overexpression of HHLA2 promoted GBC migration, invasion, proliferation and EMT, whereas in vivo experiments found a promoting role of HHLA2 overexpression on GBC tumor growth. After transfection with lentiviruses encoding the overexpression plasmid of lncRNA H19, GBC migration, invasion, proliferation and EMT were increased. By contrast, knocking down HHLA2 expression suppressed TGF‑β1‑ or lncRNA H19 overexpression‑induced GBC migration, invasion, proliferation and EMT. In addition, HHLA2 knockdown significantly reduced the sizes of the GBC tumors in vivo. These results suggest that HHLA2 overexpression can promote GBC progression. Conversely, ablation of HHLA2 expression inhibited both TGF‑β1‑ and lncRNA H19‑induced GBC progression, suggesting that HHLA2 is a potential therapeutic target for this disease.",1

Most medical patients want to be involved in decisions about their care. Whether this is true for people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—a disorder characterized by avoidance of trauma-related discussions—is unknown. We conducted an online survey assessing preferences for involvement in PTSD treatment decisions (level of control, timing) and information about PTSD treatment (content, format). Adults who screened positive for possible PTSD (N = 301) were recruited from a large online survey panel representative of the U. S. population. Virtually all respondents (97.3%) desired involvement in treatment decisions; two thirds (67.8%) wanted primary responsibility for decisions. Most (64.2%) wanted 30–60 minutes to learn about treatments and 80.1% wanted at least 1–3 days to consider their options. Respondents expressed more interest in informational content on treatment effectiveness and side effects than any other topic. In-person discussion with a provider was preferred more than other learning formats (e.g., websites, brochures). Results suggested that people with symptoms of PTSD want involvement in decisions about their treatment and want to discuss treatment options with their provider. Providers may wish to prioritize information about effectiveness and side effects, and should expect that many patients will need several days after their visit to make a decision.",1

"Abstract
Smoking-related diseases remain a significant public health concern, and heated tobacco products (HTPs) have emerged as a potential alternative to cigarettes. While several studies have confirmed that HTP aerosols contain lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) than cigarette smoke, less is known about constituents that are intrinsically higher in HTP aerosols. This study provides a comprehensive comparative assessment of an HTP aerosol produced with Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS) and comparator cigarette (CC) smoke aiming at identifying all unique or increased compounds in THS aerosol by applying a broad set of LC–MS and GC × GC–MS methods. To focus on differences due to heating versus burning tobacco, confounding factors were minimized by using the same tobacco in both test items and not adding flavorants. Of all analytical features, only 3.5%—corresponding to 31 distinctive compounds—were significantly more abundant in THS aerosol than in CC smoke. A notable subset of these compounds was identified as reaction products of glycerol. The only compound unique to THS aerosol was traced back to its presence in a non-tobacco material in the test item and not a direct product of heating tobacco. Our results demonstrate that heating a glycerol-containing tobacco substrate to the temperatures applied in THS does not introduce new compounds in the resulting aerosol compared to CC smoke which are detectable with the method portfolio applied in this study. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the chemical composition of HTP aerosols and their potential impact on human health.",1
We abstracted 752 randomly selected records of 2-year-old children at 5 public health centers in Los Angeles. Only 27% of the children were up-to-date in their vaccinations by 2 years of age. Being up-to-date was strongly associated with the number of missed opportunities to vaccinate and number of well child visits. Missed opportunities to vaccinate occurred during 52% of all visits and were associated with minor illness diagnoses and inaccurate immunization status assessment by nurses. Frequent missed opportunities to vaccinate and inadequate numbers of well child visits may result in low immunization levels among children attending public health clinics.,1
"Abstract
The prominent dual process model of moral cognition suggests that reasoners intuitively detect that harming others is wrong (deontological System-1 morality) but have to engage in demanding deliberation to realize that harm can be acceptable depending on the consequences (utilitarian System-2 morality). But the nature of the interaction between the processes is not clear. To address this key issue we tested whether deontological reasoners also intuitively grasp the utilitarian dimensions of classic moral dilemmas. In three studies subjects solved moral dilemmas in which utilitarian and deontological considerations cued conflicting or non-conflicting decisions while performing a demanding concurrent load task. Results show that reasoners’ sensitivity to conflicting moral perspectives, as reflected in decreased decision confidence and increased experienced processing difficulty, was unaffected by cognitive load. We discuss how these findings argue for a hybrid dual process model interpretation in which System-1 cues both a deontological and utilitarian intuition.",1

Objective—To identify clinical and demographic factors predictive of midurethral sling failure.
Methods—Overall treatment failure was defined by one or more of the following objective
outcomes: a positive stress test, positive 24-hour pad test or re-treatment for stress urinary
incontinence (SUI); subjective outcomes: self reported SUI by the Medical, Epidemiologic and
Social Aspect of Aging questionnaire (MESA), incontinent episodes by 3-day diary, or
retreatment for SUI, or a combination of these. Logistic regression models adjusting for sling type
and clinical site were used to predict odds of overall treatment failure after univariable analysis.
Models were also fit to compare factors associated with objective failure versus subjective failure
only.

Results—Prior UI surgery (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI], 1.99 [1.14, 3.47]); maximum Q-tip
excursion < 30° (OR 1.89 (1.16, 3.05)); MESA urge score per 10 points (OR 1.97 [1.21, 3.21]);
and pad weight per 10g (OR 1.06 [1.02, 1.10]) were predictors of overall failure. Having
concomitant surgery (OR=0.44 [0.22,0.90]) was predictive of subjective failure only rather than
objective failure. Age per 10 years (OR=1.48 [1.14, 1.90]); Urogenital Distress Inventory score
per 10 points (OR=1.09[1.02–1.17]); pad weight per 10g (OR=1.05 [1.01, 1.10]) were predictive
of objective failure compared to subjective failure only. Associations of risk factors and failure
were similar independent of sling type (retropubic or transobturator).
Conclusion—Twelve months after surgery, risk factors for overall and objective treatment
failure were similar in women undergoing retropubic and transobturator sling procedures. This
information may assist in counseling patients regarding efficacy of sling procedures and in setting
expectations for women at increased odds for treatment failure.",1
"ABSTRACT
Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze protein arginine methylation and are linked to carcinogenesis and metastasis. Some members of PRMTs have been found to undergo automethylation; however, the biologic significance of this self-modification is not entirely clear. In this report, we demonstrate that R531 of PRMT7 is self-methylated, both in vitro and in vivo. Automethylation of PRMT7 plays a key role in inducing the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and in promoting the migratory and invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. We also prove in a nude mouse model that expression of wild-type PRMT7 in MCF7 breast cancer cells promotes metastasis in vivo, in contrast to the PRMT7 R531K mutant (a mimic of the unmethylated status). Moreover, our immunohistochemical data unravel a close link between PRMT7 automethylation and the clinical outcome of breast carcinomas. Mechanistically, we determine that loss of PRMT7 automethylation leads to the reduction of its recruitment to the E-cadherin promoter by YY1, which consequently derepresses the E-cadherin expression through decreasing the H4R3me2s level. The findings in this work define a novel post-translational modification of PRMT7 that has a promoting impact on breast cancer metastasis.—Geng, P., Zhang, Y., Liu, X., Zhang, N., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Lin, C., Yan, X., Li, Z., Wang, G., Li, Y., Tan, J., Liu, D.-X., Huang, B., Lu, J.

"Abstract
Patients with a number of psychiatric and neuropathological conditions demonstrate
problems in recognising facial expressions of emotion. Research indicating that patients with
schizophrenia perform more poorly in the recognition of negative valence facial stimuli than
positive valence stimuli has been interpreted as evidence of a negative emotion specific deficit.
An alternate explanation rests in the psychometric properties of the stimulus materials. This
model suggests that the pattern of impairment observed in schizophrenia may reflect initial
discrepancies in task difficulty between stimulus categories, which are not apparent in healthy
subjects because of ceiling effects. This hypothesis is tested, by examining the performance of
healthy subjects in a facial emotion categorisation task with three levels of stimulus resolution.
Results confirm the predictions of the model, showing that performance degrades differentially across emotion categories, with the greatest deterioration to negative valence stimuli. In
the light of these results, a possible methodology for detecting emotion specific deficits in
clinical samples is discussed.",1
"Abstract
Background. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a common malignancy. And the antitumor effect of bovine pox virus-associated kinase 1 (VRK1) is becoming a hot research topic. Methods. VRK1 expression and prognosis in LUSC were analyzed using the GEPIA database. The expression of VRK1 mRNA was detected in 25 LUSC clinical tissue samples by RT-PCR. VRK1 shRNA was transfected into LUSC NCI-H520 and SK-MES-1 cell lines to interfere with VRK1 expression, and the efficiency of VRK1 shRNA interference was detected by the western blot. The effects of VRK1 downregulation on LUSC cell viability, migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis were analyzed by the CCK8 assay, scratch assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry. The effect of VRK1 downregulation on DNA damage response (DDR) was examined by immunofluorescence staining and western blot assays and further validated by in vivo experiments. Results. VRK1 was highly expressed in both LUSC tissues and cells. Survival analysis showed that the overall survival of LUSC patients with high VRK1 expression was significantly lower than that of LUSC patients with low VRK1 expression (P = 0.0026). The expression level of the VRK1 gene was significantly higher in cancer tissues of LUSC patients than in paracancerous tissues. After transfection of VRK1 shRNA in both LUSC cells, cell activity decreased (P < 0.001), migration ability started to be inhibited (P < 0.001), the ratio of G0/G1 phase cells increased (P < 0.001), and apoptosis rate increased (P < 0.001). Immunofluorescence and western blot results showed that shVRK1 increased the level of γ-H2A.X (P < 0.001) and promoted apoptosis of tumor cells (P < 0.001). In addition, the results of animal experiments showed that shVRK1 had antitumor effects (P < 0.001) and a combined effect with DOX (P < 0.001). Conclusion. The downregulation of VRK1 significantly affected the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and cell cycle progression of LUSC cells via DDR, suggesting that VRK1 is a suitable target for potential LUSC therapy.",1
"Abstract
Purpose:
In patients with Parkinson’s disease an imbalance between stimulatory D2-like receptors and inhibitory D1-like receptors may contribute to detrusor overactivity. Apomorphine, which stimulates D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors, induces detrusor overactivity in rats. Tramadol is an analgesic drug that stimulates opioid receptors and inhibits reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. To evaluate a potentially inhibitory effect of tramadol the drug was given to rats with apomorphine induced detrusor overactivity.

Material and Methods:
Female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. During anesthesia catheters were introduced into the bladder dome, femoral vein and subcutaneously (SC). Three days later the rats were placed in a metabolism cage and voiding was stimulated by infusing saline into the bladder. Micturition parameters were recorded and compared after the administration of apomorphine and tramadol or vehicle. Desmopressin was given as pretreatment to suppress the diuresis produced by tramadol.

Results:
While 30 μg kg−1 apomorphine SC was devoid of effect, 60 and 100 μg kg−1 apomorphine SC induced a transient detrusor overactivity. Tramadol (1 mg kg−1) was without effect but 5 and 10 mg kg−1 tramadol intravenously attenuated the effects of apomorphine, while inducing prominent diuresis. Pretreatment with desmopressin, which did not alter cystometry or the effects of apomorphine, abolished diuresis. In these rats 5 and 10 mg kg−1 tramadol intravenously abolished the overactivity caused by apomorphine SC.

Conclusions:
Tramadol effectively suppresses apomorphine induced detrusor overactivity in doses shown to have analgesic activity. Hence, tramadol may provide an approach to treat lower urinary tract disorders in which dopamine receptor activation is involved.

Suprapontine nervous structures exert a general inhibitory influence on lower urinary tract function. Damage to brain structures can induce detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence by decreasing suprapontine inhibitory influences on micturition control. 1 Thus, bladder symptoms can be an early expression of neurological disease. Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, characterized by selective destruction of striatal (nucleus caudatus and putamen) dopaminergic neurones, is often associated with detrusor overactivity manifesting as urge, urge incontinence, frequency and voiding difficulties. 1

Micturition control involves several neurotransmitters, including dopamine. 2 Dopamine acts on receptors that can be divided into 2 main subtypes, namely D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2A, D2B, D3 and D4) subtypes. 3 In monkeys in which dopamine was depleted from the striatum after exposure to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which is selective for the substantia nigra, bladder capacity was lower than in normal animals. 4 In MPTP treated monkeys stimulation of D1-like receptors increased bladder capacity, whereas stimulation of D2-like receptors decreased bladder capacity in normal and MPTP treated animals. Thus, detrusor overactivity caused by striatal dopaminergic lesions may be due to the removal of inhibitory D1-like receptor activation. Apomorphine, which has greater efficacy for D2 than D1-like receptors, stimulates micturition in the normal rat. 5 Thus, apomorphine administered subcutaneously (SC) can be regarded as a simple model for detrusor overactivity due to Parkinson’s disease by mimicking an imbalance between D1 and D2-like receptor activations.

In a recent study tramadol, which is an effective analgesic combining opioid receptor activation and reuptake inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline, 6 was found to inhibit micturition in rats at doses below those resulting in analgesia. 7 We explored the potential of tramadol on micturition disorders due to suprapontine damage by testing the drug on detrusor overactivity induced by apomorphine SC.

"Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and neurotoxicity. These pathologies have been associated with oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines, which may operate by activating their downstream target p38 MAP kinase. In the present study, the protective effects of a nonpsychotropic cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), were examined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after 1, 2, or 4 weeks. Retinal cell death was determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay; BRB function by quantifying extravasation of bovine serum albumin-fluorescein; and oxidative stress by assays for lipid peroxidation, dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, and tyrosine nitration. Experimental diabetes induced significant increases in oxidative stress, retinal neuronal cell death, and vascular permeability. These effects were associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and activation of p38 MAP kinase, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and/or Western blot. CBD treatment significantly reduced oxidative stress; decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1; and prevented retinal cell death and vascular hyperpermeability in the diabetic retina. Consistent with these effects, CBD treatment also significantly inhibited p38 MAP kinase in the diabetic retina. These results demonstrate that CBD treatment reduces neurotoxicity, inflammation, and BRB breakdown in diabetic animals through activities that may involve inhibition of p38 MAP kinase.
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults, affecting nearly 16 million people in the United States alone.1 Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by early breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) that causes loss of vision through macular edema and/or vitreoretinal neovascularization.2–4 Recent studies have suggested that neurodegeneration of the retina is a critical component of diabetic retinopathy.5–7 Neurotoxicity causes permanent impairment of visual function due to cell death of the inner retinal and ganglion cells. We have reported that BRB breakdown is associated with increases in oxidative stress and tyrosine nitration in early experimental diabetes.8 However, the causal role of oxidative stress in diabetes-induced neurodegeneration has not been elucidated.
The initial insult that leads to vascular dysfunction and neurotoxicity in the diabetic retina probably occurs very early. Early increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been correlated with vascular hyperpermeability in diabetic retinas, implying a proinflammatory component of the pathology.3,8,9 During early stages of experimental diabetes, leukocyte adhesion (leukostasis) occurs due to hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, the actions of proinflammatory cytokines and the consequent activation of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).10,11 Leukostasis also leads to vascular occlusion and tissue ischemia, which have been associated with changes in neuronal function, edema, and neuronal cell loss.12
The p38 MAP kinase, a stress-activated serine/threonine protein kinase, is a downstream target of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Activation of p38 MAP kinase has been reported in sensory neurons and endothelial cells maintained under high glucose conditions13,14 and in diabetic retinas.15,16 Activation of p38 MAP kinase is implicated in apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells17 and in N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced neural retinal death.18 Activation of p38 MAP kinase has also been implicated in vascular hyperper-meability in diabetic retinas19 and in VEGF-induced permeability.20,21
Cannabinoids are known to possess therapeutic properties including inhibition of oxidation,22,23 NMDA receptor-activation,24 and inflammation.25,26 The best-known cannabinoids from marijuana are (−)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and (−)-cannabidiol (CBD). The nonpsychotropic CBD has been shown to decrease interleukin-1, TNF-α, and interferon-γ in murine collagen-induced arthritis26 and to prevent central nervous system neuronal damage in gerbils caused by cerebral ischemia.27 We have recently demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of both THC and CBD via antioxidant action in NMDA-induced retinal neurotoxicity in rats.28 We have also demonstrated the BRB-preserving effects of blocking oxidative stress in diabetic rats.8 The effects of CBD on neuro-inflammation and BRB breakdown in hyperglycemia, however, have not been studied. The present study evaluates the ability of CBD to reduce oxidative stress, preserve BRB function, and prevent neural cell death in experimental diabetes.",1
"Abstract
As part of measles elimination effort, evaluation of the vaccination program and real-time assessment of the epidemic dynamics constitute two important tasks to improve and strengthen the control. The present study aimed to develop an epidemiological modeling method which can be applied to estimating the vaccine efficacy at an individual level while conducting the timely investigation of the epidemic. The multivariate renewal process model was employed to describe the temporal evolution of infection by vaccination history, jointly estimating the time-dependent reproduction number and the vaccine efficacy. Analyzing the enhanced surveillance data of measles in Aichi prefecture, Japan from 2007-08, the vaccine efficacy was estimated at 96.7% (95% confidence interval: 95.8, 97.4). Using an age structured model, the vaccine efficacy among those aged from 5-19 years was shown to be smaller than that among those from 0-4 years. The age-dependent vaccine efficacy estimate informs the age-groups to be targeted for revaccination. Because the estimation method can rest on readily available epidemiological data, the proposed model has a potential to be integrated with routine surveillance.

"Abstract
The central role of metabolic perturbation to the pathology of malaria, the promise of
antimetabolites as antimalarial drugs and a basic scientific interest in understanding this
fascinating example of highly divergent microbial metabolism has spurred a major and concerted
research effort towards elucidating the metabolic network of the Plasmodium parasites. Central
carbon metabolism, broadly comprising the flow of carbon from nutrients into biomass, has been a
particular focus due to clear and early indications that it plays an essential role in this network.
Decades of painstaking efforts have significantly clarified our understanding of these pathways of
carbon flux, and this foundational knowledge, coupled with the advent of advanced analytical
technologies, have set the stage for the development of a holistic, network-level model of
plasmodial carbon metabolism. In this review we summarize the current state of knowledge
regarding central carbon metabolism and suggest future avenues of research. We focus primarily
on the blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal of the human malaria parasites, but
also integrate results from simian, avian and rodent models of malaria that were a major focus of
early investigations into plasmodial metabolism.

Purpose
Frozen embryo transfer (FET) has no clear negative impact on neonatal outcome compared with fresh embryo transfer (ET) and appears to result in similar or even better neonatal outcome. The objective of this study was to compare early pregnancy outcome and neonatal health of children born after FET and fresh ET.

Methods
In this study early pregnancy and neonatal outcomes after FET (n = 200) and fresh ET (n = 500) were compared.

Results
For early pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy was comparable between FET and fresh ET groups. Spontaneous abortion was significantly higher in FET (14.5%) than fresh ET group (9%). Neonatal outcome was comparable between both groups except for lower live birth rate in FET (55%) versus fresh ET group (66%).

Conclusion
FET has similar neonatal outcome in terms of prematurity, low birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death and major malformation compared with fresh ET.",1
"Ubiquitin-specific protease USP4 is emerging as an important regulator of cellular pathways,
including the TGF-b response, NF-kB signalling and splicing, with possible roles in cancer.
Here we show that USP4 has its catalytic triad arranged in a productive conformation.
Nevertheless, it requires its N-terminal DUSP–Ubl domain to achieve full catalytic turnover.
Pre-steady-state kinetics measurements reveal that USP4 catalytic domain activity is strongly
inhibited by slow dissociation of ubiquitin after substrate hydrolysis. The DUSP–Ubl domain is
able to enhance ubiquitin dissociation, hence promoting efficient turnover. In a mechanism
that requires all USP4 domains, binding of the DUSP–Ubl domain promotes a change of a
switching loop near the active site. This ‘allosteric regulation of product discharge’ provides
a novel way of regulating deubiquitinating enzymes that may have relevance for other enzyme
classes.",1

clinically relevant outcomes related to asthma were included in this review. The estimates of vitamin C effect and
their confidence intervals [CI] were calculated for the included studies.
Results: Three studies that were relevant for examining the role of vitamin C on common cold-induced asthma
were identified. The three studies had a total of 79 participants. Two studies were randomized double-blind
placebo-controlled trials. A study in Nigeria on asthmatics whose asthma attacks were precipitated by respiratory
infections found that 1 g/day vitamin C decreased the occurrence of asthma attacks by 78% (95% CI: 19% to 94%).
A cross-over study in former East-Germany on patients who had infection-related asthma found that 5 g/day vitamin C
decreased the proportion of participants who had bronchial hypersensitivity to histamine by 52 percentage points
(95% CI: 25 to 71). The third study did not use a placebo. Administration of a single dose of 1 gram of vitamin C to
Italian non-asthmatic common cold patients increased the provocative concentration of histamine (PC20) 3.2-fold
(95% CI: 2.0 to 5.1), but the vitamin C effect was significantly less when the same participants did not suffer from the
common cold.
Conclusions: The three reviewed studies differed substantially in their methods, settings and outcomes. Each of them
found benefits from the administration of vitamin C; either against asthma attacks or against bronchial hypersensitivity,
the latter of which is a characteristic of asthma. Given the evidence suggesting that vitamin C alleviates common cold
symptoms and the findings of this systematic review, it may be reasonable for asthmatic patients to test vitamin C on
an individual basis, if they have exacerbations of asthma caused by respiratory infections. More research on the role of
vitamin C on common cold-induced asthma is needed.

"Bacteria use small diffusible molecules to exchange information in
a process called quorum sensing. An important class of autoinducers used by Gram-negative bacteria is the family of N-acylhomoserine lactones. Here, we report the discovery of a previously
undescribed nonenzymatically formed product from N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone; both the N-acylhomoserine and
its novel tetramic acid degradation product, 3-(1-hydroxydecylidene)-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidine-2,4-dione, are potent antibacterial agents. Bactericidal activity was observed against all tested
Gram-positive bacterial strains, whereas no toxicity was seen
against Gram-negative bacteria. We propose that Pseudomonas
aeruginosa utilizes this tetramic acid as an interference strategy to
preclude encroachment by competing bacteria. Additionally, we
have discovered that this tetramic acid binds iron with comparable
affinity to known bacterial siderophores, possibly providing an
unrecognized mechanism for iron solubilization. These findings
merit new attention such that other previously identified autoinducers be reevaluated for additional biological functions.",1
"Abstract
Objective. Many traumatized refugees experience both posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic pain. Based on Mutual Maintenance Theory and the Perpetual Avoidance Model, this study examined the additional effect of physical activity within a biofeedback-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-BF) for traumatized refugees.

Design. In a controlled design, 36 patients were randomized into one of three conditions (CBT-BF, CBT-BF with physical activity [CBT-BF+active], and a waiting list control group [WL]). Thirty patients (n = 10 in each group) completed the treatment and a follow-up assessment 3 months later. Participants' coping strategies, pain and mental health status, and physiological reactivity were assessed before and after the intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Treatment effects were analyzed using analyses of variance with baseline scores as covariates (ANCOVAs) and the Reliable Change Index.

Results. The CBT-BF and CBT-BF+active groups showed improvements in all outcome measures relative to the WL group. The effect sizes for the main outcome measures were higher in the CBT-BF+active group than in the CBT-BF group. Repeated measures analyses of covariance showed significant group effects for coping strategies—in particular, for the “cognitive restructuring” and “counter-activities” subscales as well as a marginally significant group effect for “perceived self-competence”—with the CBT-BF+active group showing more favorable outcomes than the CBT-BF group. Moreover, 60% of participants in the CBT-BF+active group showed clinically reliable intraindividual change in at least one subscale of the pain coping strategies questionnaire, compared with just 30% of participants in the CBT-BF group.

Conclusion. Findings of improved coping strategies, larger effect sizes, and higher rates of clinical improvement in the CBT-BF+active group suggest that physical activity adds value to pain management interventions for traumatized refugees. Given the small sample size, however, these preliminary results need replication in a larger trial.

"Abstract
Objective: 
The devices to be used in clinical practice should be tested for accuracy and should be validated through the validation protocol. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Meditech-ABPM-06 ambulatory blood pressure monitor.

Materials and methods: 
The test was carried out in accordance with the protocol established by the European Society of Hypertension (ESH-IP), the British Hypertension Society, and the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2-2013 protocols.

Results: 
In the European Society of Hypertension validation procedure the subjects with two or three of the absolute differences between observer and device SBP/DBP measurements within 5 mmHg were 31/31. The average device-observer difference was −0.4 ± 3.9 mmHg for SBP and −0.4 ± 2.8 mmHg for DBP. In the British Hypertension Society validation procedure the mean differences of the test device and observer readings were −1.0 ± 4.6 (systolic) and −1.1 ± 4.5 (diastolic). In the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2-2013 validation procedure (criterion 1) the mean ± SD of the differences between the test device and reference BP was −0.5 ± 4.0/−0.3 ± 4.5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). The two criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO were fulfilled.

Conclusion: 
The Meditech ABPM-06 blood pressure measure device met the requirements specified by the British Hypertension Society, the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol and the AAMI, and therefore was considered acceptable to clinical use with a Grade of A/A.",1
"Summary
The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased dramatically during the last
four decades and is paralleled by a striking increase in iron intake by infants
in affluent societies. Several studies have suggested a link between increased
iron intake and the marked increase in prevalence of allergic diseases. We
hypothesized that the increased iron intake by infants offers an explanation
for the increased prevalence of allergic disease in industrialized societies
during the past four decades. A well-established mouse model of ovalbumin
(OVA)-driven allergic asthma was used to test the effects of differences in iron
intake and systemic iron levels on the manifestations of allergic asthma. Surprisingly, iron supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in airway
eosinophilia, while systemic iron injections lead to a significant suppression of
both allergen-induced airway eosinophilia and hyperreactivity compared to
placebo. In contrast, mice fed on an iron-deprived diet did not show any
difference in developing experimentally induced allergic asthma when compared to those fed on an iron-sufficient control diet. In contrast to our
hypothesis, airway manifestations of allergic asthma are suppressed by both
increased levels of iron intake and systemic iron administrations in the mouse
model.",1
"Abstract: To understand the chronic spleen injury induced by
intragastric administrations with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg_x0001_1 body
weight titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) for 90 consecutive days, histopathological and ultrastructure changes,
hematological parameters, lymphocyte subsets, the inflammatory, and apoptotic cytokines in the mouse spleen were
investigated. Our findings indicate that TiO2 NPs exposure
results in the significant increase in the spleen indices, histopathological changes, and splenocyte apoptosis in spleen.
Especially, in these TiO2 NPs-treated mice, immunoglobulin,
blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin, lymphocyte subsets (such
as CD3, CD4, CD8, B cell, natural killer cell) of mice were significantly decreased. Furthermore, TiO2 NPs exposure can
significantly increase the levels of nucleic factor-jB, tumor

heat shock protein 70 expression. These findings suggest
that long-term exposure to low dose TiO2 NPs may result in
spleen injury and reduction of immune capacity, TiO2 NPinduced injury in spleen may result from alteration of inflammatory and apoptotic cytokines expression, and workers and
consumers should take great caution when handling nanomaterials. VC 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A:

Objective
To examine the covariation between negative symptoms and motor signs in a broad sample of drug-naïve subjects with schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses before and after inception of antipsychotic medication.
Methods: One-hundred and eighty-nine antipsychotic-naïve subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses were assessed for negative symptoms including affective flattening, alogia, avolition/apathy and anhedonia/associality, and motor signs including catatonia, parkinsonism and dyskinesia. We examined the association
between negative and motor features at baseline, 4-weeks after inception of antipsychotic treatment and that of
their mean change over the treatment period, such as their trajectories and treatment response pattern.
Results: At the drug-naïve state, motor signs were strongly related to affective flattening and alogia (p b 0.01); at
4-weeks, most negative and motor features were significantly interrelated (p b 0.01); mean change of motor
signs and negative symptoms tended to be unrelated. This association pattern was irrespective of levels of positive symptoms. Ratings of negative symptoms, excepting affective flattening, improved after treatment (p b
0.001) while motor ratings showed divergent trajectories with catatonia improving (p b 0.001), parkinsonism
worsening (p b 0.001) and dyskinesia remaining unchanged (p N 0.01). Although to a different extent, motor
and negative features showed drug-responsive, drug-worsening, of drug-unchanged patterns of response to antipsychotic medication. The main predictors of negative and motor features in treated subjects were their corresponding baseline ratings (p b 0.001).
Conclusions: Negative and motor features are differentiated, but to some extent, overlapping domains that are
meaningfully influenced by antipsychotic medication. At the drug-naïve state, motor signs and the diminished
expression domain of negative symptoms may share underlying neurobiological mechanisms.",1
"Objective: To date, there are no studies regarding the lactylation profile and its role in critically ill patients. Thus, we aimed to examine expression of histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18) lactylation and its role in patients with septic shock.

Methods: Thirteen healthy volunteers and 35 critically ill patients from the Department of Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, Beijing Hospital were enrolled in our study. Baseline information and clinical outcomes were obtained prospectively. Lactylation levels of all proteins and H3K18 from peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) were determined by western blotting and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines by flow cytometry. Arginase-1 (Arg1) and Krüppel-like factor-4 (Klf4) mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).

Results: Lactylation was found to be an all-protein post-translational modification and was detected in PBMCs from both healthy volunteers and critically ill patients, with a significantly higher relative density in shock patients (t=2.172, P=0.045). H3K18la was expressed in all subjects, including healthy volunteers, with the highest level in septic shock patients (compared with non-septic shock patients, critically ill without shock patients and healthy volunteers P=0.033, 0.000 and 0.000, respectively). Furthermore, H3K18la protein expression correlated positively with APACHE II scores, SOFA scores on day 1, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation time and serum lactate (ρ=0.42, 0.63, 0.39, 0.51 and 0.48, respectively, ρ=0.012, 0.000, 0.019, 0.003 and 0.003, respectively). When we matched patients with septic shock and with non-septic shock according to severity, we found higher H3K18la levels in the former group (t=-2.208, P =0.040). Moreover, H3K18la exhibited a close correlation with procalcitonin levels (ρ=0.71, P=0.010). Patients with high H3K18la expression showed higher IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-α levels (ρ=0.33, 0.37, 0.62, 0.55, 0.65, 0.49 and 0.374 respectively, P=0.024, 0.011, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000 and 0.000 respectively). H3K18la expression also displayed a positive correlation with the level of Arg1 mRNA (ρ=0.561, P=0.005).

Conclusions: Lactylation is an all-protein post-translational modification occurring in both healthy subjects and critically ill patients. H3K18la may reflect the severity of critical illness and the presence of infection. H3K18la might mediate inflammatory cytokine expression and Arg1 overexpression and stimulate the anti-inflammatory function of macrophages in sepsis.",1
"Background: It is well-accepted that antihypertensive therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients with hypertension. Direct-acting vasodilators were used in the treatment of hypertension by directly relaxing vascular smooth muscle but may have destructive effects on the aortic wall by activating the renin–angiotensin system axis. Their roles in AAA disease remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used hydralazine and minoxidil, two classical direct-acting vasodilators, to investigate their influence and potential mechanisms on AAA disease.

Methods and results: In this study, we investigated the plasma renin level and plasma renin activity in AAA patients. Simultaneously, age and gender ratio-matched patients diagnosed with peripheral artery disease and varicose veins were selected as the control group using a ratio of 1:1:1. Our regression analysis suggested both the plasma renin level and plasma renin activity are positively associated with AAA development. In view of the well-established relationship between direct-acting vasodilators and increased plasma renin concentration, we established a porcine pancreatic elastase-infused AAA mouse model, followed by oral administration of hydralazine (250 mg/L) and minoxidil (120 mg/L) to investigate effects of direct-acting vasodilators on AAA disease. Our results suggested both hydralazine and minoxidil promoted the progression of AAA with increased aortic degeneration. Mechanistically, the vasodilators aggravated aortic inflammation by increased leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory cytokine secretion.

Conclusion and relevance: The plasma renin level and plasma renin activity are positively associated with AAA development. Direct vasodilators aggravated experimental AAA progression, which raised cautionary concerns about their applications in AAA disease.

"ABSTRACT
The family Anelloviridae comprises torque teno viruses (TTVs) diverse in genome structure and organization. The isolation of a large number of TTV genomes (TTV Heidelberg [TTV-HD]) of 26 TTV types is reported. Several isolates from the same type indicate sequence variation within open reading frame 1 (ORF1), resulting in considerably modified open reading frames. We demonstrate in vitro replication of 12 full-length genomes of TTV-HD in 293TT cells. Propagation of virus was achieved by several rounds of infections using supernatant and frozen whole cells of initially infected cells. Replication of virus was measured by PCR amplification and transcription analyses. Subgenomic molecules (μTTV), arising early during propagation and ranging in size from 401 to 913 bases, were cloned and characterized. Propagation of these μTTV in in vitro cultures was demonstrated in the absence of full-length genomes.",1
"Abstract
The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) genes have been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the associations between polymorphisms of ALDH2 and ADH2 genes and HCC. Published literatures from PubMed and Embase were retrieved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Ten studies including 1,231 HCC cases and 1,849 controls were included in the meta-analysis of the association between ALDH2 polymorphism and HCC risk. The results indicated that ALDH2 polymorphism was not significantly associated with risk of HCC (homogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.72–1.34; heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.75–1.08; dominant model: OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.70–1.18; recessive model: OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.66–1.87). In addition, four studies including 518 cases and 607 controls were included in the meta-analysis of the association between ADH2 polymorphism and HCC risk. There was no association between ADH2 polymorphism and HCC risk (homogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.58–1.51; heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.87–2.23; dominant model: OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.76–1.88; recessive model: OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.54–1.54). Further analysis suggested that the ALDH2 polymorphism–alcohol interaction was marginally associated with HCC risk under the dominant model (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.01–4.17). However, the result was not robust by sensitivity analysis. The results from the present meta-analysis indicated that there was no significant association between ALDH2 polymorphism, ADH2 polymorphism, or ALDH2 polymorphism–alcohol intake interaction and HCC risk in the East Asians.",1
"Abstract: Quantum network coding is used to solve the congestion problem
in quantum communication, which will promote the transmission efficiency
of quantum information and the total throughput of quantum network. We
propose a novel controlled quantum network coding without information loss.
The effective transmission of quantum states on the butterfly network requires
the consent form a third-party controller Charlie. Firstly, two pairs of threeparticle non-maximum entangled states are pre-shared between senders and
controller. By adding auxiliary particles and local operations, the senders can
predict whether a certain quantum state can be successfully transmitted within
the butterfly network based on the Z-{|0, |1} basis. Secondly, when transmission fails upon prediction, the quantum state will not be lost, and it will still
be held by the sender. Subsequently, the controller Charlie re-prepares another
three-particle non-maximum entangled state to start a new round. When the
predicted transmission is successful, the quantum state can be transmitted
successfully within the butterfly network. If the receiver wants to receive the
effective quantum state, the quantum measurements from Charlie are needed.
Thirdly, when the transmission fails, Charlie does not need to integrate the
X-{|+, |−} basis to measure its own particles, by which quantum resources
are saved. Charlie not only controls the effective transmission of quantum
states, but also the usage of classical and quantum channels. Finally, the
implementation of the quantum circuits, as well as a flow chart and safety
analysis of our scheme, is proposed.

"Abstract
Transcription and regulation of genes originate from transcription pre-initiation complexes (PICs). Their structural and positional organization across eukaryotic genomes is unknown. Here we applied lambda exonuclease to chromatin immunoprecipitates (termed ChIP-exo) to examine the precise location of 6,045 PICs in Saccharomyces. PICs, including RNA polymerase II and protein complexes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (or TBP), TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIK were positioned within promoters and excluded from coding regions. Exonuclease patterns were in agreement with crystallographic models of the PIC, and were sufficiently precise to identify TATA-like elements at so-called TATA-less promoters. These PICs and their transcription start sites were positionally constrained at TFIID-engaged downstream +1 nucleosomes. At TATA-box-containing promoters, which are depleted of TFIID, a +1 nucleosome was positioned to be in competition with the PIC, which may allow greater latitude in start-site selection. Our genomic localization of messenger RNA and non-coding RNA PICs reveals that two PICs, in inverted orientation, may occupy the flanking borders of nucleosome-free regions. Their unambiguous detection may help distinguish bona fide genes from transcriptional noise.",1
"Abstract
Background: Use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) has been associated with increased risk of breast cancer in some, but not all, studies. Differences in reported associations from prior studies may be due, in part, to inadequate control of confounding factors.

Methods: Participants were 28,561 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative who reported use of either CCBs or other antihypertensive medications (AHMs) at baseline; 1,402 incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed during 12 years of follow-up. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between CCB use relative to other AHM use and breast cancer risk.

Results: Use of CCBs was not associated with breast cancer risk (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20) relative to use of other AHMs. Associations approximated the null value when CCBs were considered by duration of use, length of action, or drug class.

Conclusions: We provide additional evidence that CCBs do not influence breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women.

Impact: The results from this study, which includes strong control for potential confounding factors, cast doubt on increases in risk with CCBs. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(8); 1345–8. ©2017 AACR.",1

Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), mostly with the use of vital dye or radioisotope, is a
method for predicting axillary status in patients with breast cancer. Conventional axillary lymph node
dissection (ALND) is used in cases where sentinel lymph node (SLN) is not detected by existing methods,
but a series of studies have found that most of SLNs are present in specific anatomical spaces. We
attempted to determine the feasibility of SLNB based on axillary anatomy in cases where SLN was not
detected by conventional lymphatic mapping methods.
Methods: A retrospective analysis involving 208 patients who received anatomical SLNB between
January 2003 and December 2010 was performed. Lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle and
lateral thoracic vein were defined as the anatomical landmarks, and ALND was performed to at least level
II, regardless of the results of frozen section analysis. Pathologic results were used to measure false
negative rate and accuracy. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were performed to find factors
affecting results.
Results: False negative rate and accuracy of anatomical SLNB were 21.7% (13/60) and 93.3% (182/195),
respectively. T stage, clinical node status, number of dissected SLNs and body mass index were analyzed
as factors affecting results, but none of them was found as having a statistically significant influence.
Conclusion: These results suggest that anatomical SLNB may not replace ALND in cases where SLN is not
detected by conventional lymphatic mapping method, but may be considered as a method for predicting
axillary status before conducting a node dissection.",1
"Abstract
Background and study aims—The fanning technique for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fineneedle aspiration (EUS–FNA) involves sampling multiple areas within a lesion with each pass.
The aim of this study was to compare the fanning and standard techniques for EUS–FNA of solid
pancreatic masses.
Patients and methods—Consecutive patients with solid pancreatic mass lesions were
randomized to undergo EUS–FNA using either the standard or the fanning technique. The main
outcome measure was the median number of passes required to establish diagnosis. The secondary
outcome measures were the diagnostic accuracy, technical failure, and complication rate of the
two techniques.
Results—Of 54 patients, 26were randomized to the standard technique and 28 to the fanning
technique. There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy (76.9% vs. 96.4 %; P=0.05), technical
failure or complication rates (none in either cohort). There was a significant difference in both the
number of passes required to establish diagnosis (median 1 [interquartile range 1–3] vs. 1 [1–1];
P=0.02) and the percentage of patients in whom a diagnosis was achieved on pass one (57.7% vs.
85.7 %; P = 0.02) between the standard and fanning groups, respectively.
Conclusions—The fanning technique of FNA was superior to the standard approach because
fewer passes were required to establish the diagnosis. If these promising data are confirmed by
other investigators, consideration should be given to incorporating the fanning technique into
routine practice of EUS–FNA.",1

Abstract.Background: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of supplementation with flaxseed on anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and inflammatory biomarkers in overweight and obese adults.

Methods: Fifty overweight and obese adults with body mass index (BMI) of 30.72 ± 3.31 kg/m2 participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to take lifestyle advice or lifestyle advice plus 30 g/day milled flaxseed for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was body weight; secondary outcomes included other anthropometric parameters, lipid profile and inflammatory biomarkers.

Results: At the end of the study, the following significant mean differences were seen in flaxseed and control groups, respectively: weight [−9.36 vs. −3.09 kg; P < 0.001], BMI [−3.34 vs. −1.2 kg/m2; P < 0.001], triglycerides [−62.88 vs. −9.85 mg/dL; P < 0.001], total cholesterol [−32.2 vs. −14.95 mg/dL; P = 0.04], homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) [1.25 vs. −0.32; P = 0.024], high sensitive- C reactive protein [−2.2 vs. −1.01 mmol/L; P < 0.001] and tumor necrosis factor-α [−1.34 vs. −0.14 pg/mL; P = 0.005].

Conclusion: These results suggest that flaxseed supplementation in addition to lifestyle modification is significantly superior to lifestyle modification alone for weight loss. More studies with different dosages of flaxseed are needed to find the optimal dosage. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02410668.

"Abstract
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs), as largest production and use of nanomaterials, have been demonstrated to have a potential toxicity on reproductive system. However, the mechanism underlying male reproductive toxicity of TiO2 NPs remains limited. Thus, our study was designed to examine the cellular viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, and expression of apoptotic cytokines in primary cultured Sertoli cells isolated from mice under TiO2 NPs exposure. Results showed that TiO2 NPs exposure from 5 to 30 μg/mL resulted in reduction of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, and induction of apoptosis or death on Sertoli cells. TiO2 NPs could migrate to Sertoli cells, which induced mitochondria-mediated or endoplasmic-reticulum-mediated apoptotic changes including elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and reductions in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and releases of cytochrome c into the cytosol. In addition, upregulation of cytochrome c, Bax, caspase-3, glucose-regulated protein 78, and C/EBP homologous protein and caspase-12 protein expression, and downregulation of bcl-2 protein expression in primary cultured Sertoli cells induced by TiO2 NPs treatment. All of the results suggested that ROS generation may play a critical role in the initiation of TiO2 NPs-induced apoptosis by mediation of the disruption of ΔΨm, the cytochrome c release, and further the activation of caspase cascade and unfolded protein response signaling pathway. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Background
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction. Few studies have used noninvasive techniques to measure epidermis function in asymptomatic neonates.
Methods
Data of 116 infants from our previous randomized controlled study were analyzed. Skin barrier function was measured through transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration (SCH), and pH. The association between skin barrier function and time to AD development was evaluated. Patients were classified with high or low TEWL, and SCH and pH were assessed. The survival function of the time to AD development and hazard ratios were estimated. Allergic sensitization to egg white and ovomucoid at 32 weeks was assessed.
Results
Regardless of a filaggrin mutation, TEWL (optimal cutoff, 6.5 g/m2/h) of the forehead within the first week of life showed a lower p-value than TEWL of the leg, and the SCH and pH measurements. Baseline TEWL of the forehead was not different between groups, except for the mean gestational age, and it was not affected by humidity. We found a significant difference in the cumulative AD incidence between the high and low TEWL groups for the forehead only (p < 0.05). The probability without AD was lower in the high TEWL group than in the low TEWL group. For only the high TEWL group, AD development decreased significantly with daily emollient use. The high TEWL group exhibited a higher rate of sensitization to ovomucoid (p = 0.07).
Conclusions
TEWL of the forehead during the first week of life is associated with AD development.",1

PURPOSE Positive effects have been reported after mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in diverse clinical and nonclinical populations. Primary care is a key health care setting for addressing common chronic conditions, and an effective MBI designed for this setting could benefit countless people worldwide. Meta-analyses of MBIs have become popular, but little is known about their efficacy in primary care. Our aim was to investigate the application and efficacy of MBIs that address primary care patients.

METHODS We performed a meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials addressing the effect of MBIs in adult patients recruited from primary care settings. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and Cochrane guidelines were followed. Effect sizes were calculated with the Hedges g in random effects models.

RESULTS The meta-analyses were based on 6 trials having a total of 553 patients. The overall effect size of MBI compared with a control condition for improving general health was moderate (g = 0.48; P = .002), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 59; P <.05). We found no indication of publication bias in the overall estimates. MBIs were efficacious for improving mental health (g = 0.56; P = .007), with a high heterogeneity (I2 = 78; P <.01), and for improving quality of life (g = 0.29; P = .002), with a low heterogeneity (I2 = 0; P >.05).

CONCLUSIONS Although the number of randomized controlled trials applying MBIs in primary care is still limited, our results suggest that these interventions are promising for the mental health and quality of life of primary care patients. We discuss innovative approaches for implementing MBIs, such as complex intervention and stepped care.",1

checked by a second reviewer. Fifteen trials including 16 contrasts of atypical antipsychotics
with placebo met selection criteria: aripiprazole (k_x0001_3), olanzapine (k_x0001_5), quetiapine (k_x0001_3),
and risperidone (k_x0001_5). A total of 3,353 patients were randomized to drug and 1,757 to
placebo. Standard meta-analysis methods were used to summarize outcomes. Results: Quality
of the reporting of trials varied. Efficacy on rating scales was observed by meta-analysis for
aripiprazole and risperidone, but not for olanzapine. Response rates were frequently not
reported. There were smaller effects for less severe dementia, outpatients, and patients selected
for psychosis. Approximately one-third dropped out without overall differences between drug
and placebo. Adverse events were mainly somnolence and urinary tract infection or incontinence across drugs, and extrapyramidal symptoms or abnormal gait with risperidone or
olanzapine. Cognitive test scores worsened with drugs. There was no evidence for increased
injury, falls, or syncope. There was a significant risk for cerebrovascular events, especially with
risperidone; increased risk for death overall was reported elsewhere. Conclusions: Small
statistical effect sizes on symptom rating scales support the evidence for the efficacy of
aripiprazole and risperidone. Incomplete reporting restricts estimates of response rates and
clinical significance. Dropouts and adverse events further limit effectiveness. Atypicals should
be considered within the context of medical need and the efficacy and safety of alternatives.
Individual patient meta-analyses are needed to better assess clinical significance and effectiveness. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2006; 14:191–210)

"Abstract
Comparable data on trends of hospitalization rates for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) remain unavailable in representative Asian populations.

To examine the temporal trends of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its subtypes in Beijing.

Patients hospitalized for AMI in Beijing from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012 were identified from the validated Hospital Discharge Information System. Trends in hospitalization rates, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospitalization costs were analyzed by regression models for total AMI and for STEMI and NSTEMI separately. In total, 77,943 patients were admitted for AMI in Beijing during the 6 years, among whom 67.5% were males and 62.4% had STEMI. During the period, the rate of AMI hospitalization per 100,000 population increased by 31.2% (from 55.8 to 73.3 per 100,000 population) after age standardization, with a slight decrease in STEMI but a 3-fold increase in NSTEMI. The ratio of STEMI to NSTEMI decreased dramatically from 6.5:1.0 to 1.3:1.0. The age-standardized in-hospital mortality decreased from 11.2% to 8.6%, with a significant decreasing trend evident for STEMI in males and females (P < 0.001) and for NSTEMI in males (P = 0.02). The rate of percutaneous coronary intervention increased from 28.7% to 55.6% among STEMI patients. The total cost for AMI hospitalization increased by 56.8% after adjusting for inflation, although the LOS decreased by 1 day.

The hospitalization burden for AMI has been increasing in Beijing with a transition from STEMI to NSTEMI. Diverse temporal trends in AMI subtypes from the unselected “real-world” data in Beijing may help to guide the management of AMI in China and other developing countries.",1

Objective—The LA Sprouts 12-week nutrition, cooking and gardening intervention targets
obesity reduction in Latino children. While other gardening and nutrition programs are shown to
improve dietary intake, LA Sprouts is unique in that it utilized a curriculum demonstrated to
decrease obesity. This methodology paper outlines the design and processes of the LA Sprouts
study, and discusses key strategies employed to foster successful implementation of the program.
Setting—After-school program in four Los Angeles elementary schools.
Subjects—3
rd–5th grade students.
Design—Randomized controlled trial. Gardens were built on two of four school campuses, and
the 90-minute weekly lessons focused on strategies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption,
gardening at school and home, and cooking healthy meals/snacks. Data collection was conducted
pre- and post-intervention and included basic clinical and anthropometric measures, dietary intake
and psychosocial constructs measured by questionnaire, and an optional fasting blood draw.
Results—Baseline data was collected from 364 children, and 320 (88%) completed follow-up.
No participants withdrew from the program (data were missing for other reasons). Intervention
students attended 9.7 ± 2.3 lessons. Fasting blood samples were collected on 169 children at
baseline, and 113 (67%) at follow-up. Questionnaire scales had good internal consistency (IC) and
intra-rater reliability (IRR; in child scales: 88% items with IC >0.7 and 70% items with IRR >
0.50; in parent scales: 75% items with IC > 0.7).",1

Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of laparoscope-assisted peritoneal vaginoplasty for the treatment of congenital vaginal atresia. Methods: A retrospective study enrolled patients diagnosed with congenital vaginal atresia
who were treated with one of two different laparoscope-assisted peritoneal vaginoplasty techniques (named
Luohu-one and Luohu-two) between October 31, 2001 and December 31, 2014. Operative time, intraoperative
bleeding volume, surgical difficulty, complications, and post-procedure sexual satisfaction were reported. Results:
Data were collected for 620 patients. The Luohu-one procedure was used in the treatment of 145 patients, while
475 patients were treated with the Luohu-two procedure. In 5 (0.8%) patients, it was necessary to perform a
sigmoid colon vaginoplasty. During surgery, 16 patients experienced a rectal injury, among whom, 9 patients
experienced a rectal–vaginal fistula. Follow-up data extending to 7 years were available for 285 patients. Of
these 285 patients, 231 agreed to report details of their sexual experiences. In total, 222 (96.1%) patients reported
being very satisfied with their vaginal conditions and sex life. The Luohu-two procedure demonstrated shorter
operative and recovery time, and reduced intraoperative bleeding. However, both procedures demonstrated
satisfactory results. Conclusion: Laparoscope-assisted peritoneal vaginoplasty demonstrated good safety and
effectiveness in the treatment of patients with congenital vaginal atresia.

"ABSTRACT
Polygonum minus is a plant rich in flavonoids and antioxidants beneficial for reducing oxidative stress and lipid
peroxidation in neuronal membranes. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the potential
benefits of P. minus extract (LineMinusTM) towards improving cognitive function, mood status and quality of life. Thirty
five middle-aged women (35-55 years old) were randomized into intervention (n=17) and control group (n=18). Two
capsules of P. minus (250 mg) or placebo (100 mg maltodextrin) each were taken once daily for six weeks. Cognitive
tests, mood and anthropometric measurements were measured at baseline, week 3 and week 6, whilst biomarkers were
measured at baseline and week 6. Parameters related to mood and quality of life including energy/fatigue, social
functioning and general health significantly improved from baseline to week 6 in the intervention group (p<0.05). Mean
score for cognitive tests (i.e. digit span, comprehensive trail making test (CTMT) and three domains of CNS vital sign
(CNSVS)] improved significantly in both intervention and control groups (p<0.05). There was a significant decrease of
mean uric acid, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in the
intervention group from baseline to week 6. P. minus supplementation has the potential to improve mood and quality of
life and no adverse effects were reported by the participants after 6 weeks supplementation.

"Abstract
Objectives
Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with increased mortality and morbidity rates due to acute renal failure (ARF). Oxidative stress induced with renal I/R injury directly affects glomerular and tubular epithelium through reactive oxygen species. Several studies have been directed to the treatment of renal I/R injury. The aim of this study was to test the attenuation with silymarin (SM) treatment of renal I/R injury-induced morphological changes in the rat kidney.

Methods
A total of 32 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated in four groups. Group I (sham), Group II (renal I/R), Group III (renal I/R injury + SM 50 mg per kg) and Group IV (renal I/R injury + SM 100 mg per kg) were designed to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of SM on the morphological changes of renal I/R injury. Renal I/R injury were induced with left renal pedicle occlusion for 45 min followed with reperfusion for 6 h under anesthesia. After induction of I/R injury, left nephrectomies were performed for histopathological examinations.

Results
After renal I/R injury, significant tubular dilatation, tubular vacuolization, pelvic inflammation, interstitial inflammation, perirenal adipose infiltration, tubular necrosis and glomerular necrosis (cortical necrosis) were observed. However, even with low dose SM in Group III (50 mg per kg SM), histopathological changes due to I/R injury were prevented.

Conclusions
The results of this study have demonstrated that SM significantly prevents renal I/R injury-induced renal tubular changes in the rat. SM in 50 mg/kg was observed to be sufficient to significantly prevent renal tubular necrosis. Further, to our literature knowledge, this is the first specific study to demonstrate the preventive effect of SM on renal I/R injury.

"Summary
Background
The characterisation and management of chronic severe gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility are challenging. It may cause intestinal failure requiring home parenteral nutrition (HPN).

Aims
To review the presentation, aetiology, characterisation, management and outcome of chronic severe GI dysmotility, and to suggest a pragmatic management algorithm.

Methods
PubMed search was performed up to December 2012 using appropriate search terms, restricted to human articles and reviewed for relevance. Segmental dysmotility, acute ileus, functional syndromes and non-English articles were excluded. Evidence and recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE system.

Results
In total, 721 relevant articles were reviewed. A coherent and definitive picture is hampered by overlapping classification systems using multi-modal characterisation methods, subject to pitfalls and some requiring further validation. The literature is confined to case series with no randomised trials. Fewer than 20% undergo full thickness jejunal biopsy, which are otherwise labelled idiopathic. However, in studies with up to 80% biopsy rates, neuromuscular abnormalities may be found in 90%. Between 14% and 50% will require HPN, comprising 8–14% of all HPN patients, of which 2/3 are primary/idiopathic and 1/3 secondary, with scleroderma being the leading secondary cause. Ten-year  mortality ranges from 13% to 35% and is worst in elderly scleroderma patients. Management includes limited treatments for secondary causes, prokinetics, symptom palliation, psychological support, nutrition, hydration and judicious surgery.

Conclusions
Severe dysmotility often remains idiopathic. It is rarely possible to alter disease trajectory; consequently, prognosis may be poor. Multi-disciplinary teams in a specialist setting can improve outcomes. Graded recommendations are enumerated and a pragmatic algorithm is suggested.",1
"Abstract
This study evaluates the associations of nutrition knowledge and health literacy with health care
transition (HCT) readiness and self-management in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with
chronic kidney disease (CKD) or hypertension. Chronically ill AYAs with poor HCT or selfmanagement skills are less likely to achieve favorable health outcomes as they enter adulthood.
Health literacy and nutrition knowledge, which are identified as important contributors to health
outcomes, may suggest important points of interventions to improve self-management skills. For
the study, we enrolled 59 consecutive patients ages 12–29, with a diagnosis of CKD or hypertension at pediatric- and adult-focused clinics in the United States. Participants completed measures of nutrition knowledge, health literacy, and the Self-management and Transition to
Adulthood with Rx ¼ treatment (STARx) questionnaire. Correlation tests and multivariate
regressions were employed for data analysis. The findings show that health literacy was positively
associated with self-management skills (p ¼ .050), communication with providers (p ¼ .002) and
overall HCT (p ¼ .001) after adjusting for key variables. Disease-specific nutrition knowledge
positively predicted communication with providers (p ¼ .002) and overall HCT (p < .001) after
adjusting for key variables. Therefore, health literacy and nutrition knowledge predicted self management and transition readiness. Testing for these skills should be considered in clinics and
HCT preparation for AYAs with chronic conditions.

"Abstract
Background 
The alginate–antacid Gaviscon Double Action (Gaviscon DA) has a combined acid-neutralizing and reflux-suppressing action. Response to treatment in a symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) population has not yet been tested in a large-scale clinical study.

Aim 
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Gaviscon DA compared with matched placebo tablets in the reduction of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with GERD.

Participants and methods 
In this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adults with GERD symptoms (N=424) received Gaviscon DA or placebo tablets for 7 days. The primary endpoint was a clinically important reduction of at least 1.5 points in the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) GERD dimension (combined heartburn/regurgitation) between baseline and the end of the treatment. Secondary endpoints included the change in RDQ score from baseline for individual RDQ dimensions and Overall Treatment Evaluation.

Results 
A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with Gaviscon DA met the primary endpoint compared with placebo (47.8 vs. 33.2%, respectively, P=0.0031; odds ratio: 1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–2.78). A significant treatment effect was also observed for heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia individually. Patients in the Gaviscon DA group rated their overall treatment response greater than patients in the placebo group [mean Overall Treatment Evaluation (SD): 3.2 (3.08) vs. 2.2 (3.34); P<0.001]. No notable differences in the incidence of adverse events were observed between treatments.

Conclusion 
The alginate–antacid combination, Gaviscon DA, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment to reduce reflux symptoms and associated dyspepsia in symptomatic GERD patients.",1
"Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurotropic coronavirus that invades the host central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Microglia are key immune cells in the CNS, however, whether and how they response to PHEV infection remains unclear. Herein, microglial activation and proliferation were detected in the CNS of PHEV-infected mice, as along with the proinflammatory response. Moreover, the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by moderately activated microglia limited viral replication in the early stage of infection. Microglial depletion assays showed that during late infection, excess activation of microglia aggravated neurological symptoms, BBB destruction, and peripheral monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the CNS. Using an in vitro brain slice model, PHEV was identified to specifically and moderately induce microglial activation in the absence of peripheral immune cells infiltration. Consistently, macrophage clearance from circulating blood indicated that peripheral monocytes/macrophages crossing the BBB of mice were responsible for excess activation of microglia and CNS damage in late PHEV infection. Overall, our findings provide evidence supporting a dual role for microglia in the host CNS in response to coronavirus PHEV invasion.",1
"In the last 50 years, archaeological finds from Amazonia have forced revision of some theories about human
evolution. A common assumption had been that human evolution was restricted by environmental limitations
which favored slow progression from simple, unspecialized, economically unproductive cultures to complex,
specialized, and highly productive ones. This assumption has long influenced interpretations of human
evolution in the humid tropics 1 4. It presumed that the first Americans would not have been broad spectrum
foragers but instead big game hunters following herds from the Siberian steppes into similar American
habitats 8.Only after those megafauna went extinct at the end of the Ice Age were people hypothesized to
have developed agriculture in the dry, open vegetation valleys of the Central Andes and Mesoamerica, before
finally migrating into the tropical forests and coastal lowlands 9. According to the environmental limitation
theory, only cooler agricultural zones fostered conditions that gave rise to civilized achievements like math,
astronomy, and calendars exhibited by the Maya, Aztec, and Inca. Hunter gatherers were notpredicted to
need, nor deemed capable of devising such cultural achievements.",1
"Abstract
Activated cell surface and intracellular receptors lead to insulin resistance in obesity. Among these receptors, triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1, toll like receptors (TLRs), and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) play a significant role in the induction of inflammatory response in innate immunity. TREM-1 potentially amplifies TLRs and RAGE synergistically with DNA-binding high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1). The objective of the study was to analyze the association between TREM-1/DAP12 and HMGB-1, RAGE and TLRs in obesity-induced insulin resistance. We examined the mRNA expression by RT-PCR and protein expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence for TREM-1, TREM-2, DAP-12, HMGB-1, RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2 in omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsy tissues of obese diabetic (n=22) and non-diabetic subjects (n=24) and compared with the non-obese non-diabetic controls (n=5). There was a significantly increased expression of TREM-1, DAP-12, HMGB-1, RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2 and decreased expression of TREM-2 in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsy of obese diabetic subjects compared to obese non-diabetics and the non-obese population. Overall, obese diabetic subjects had high expression of TREM-1 in association with HMGB1 (100% vs 58.3%, P=0.003), RAGE (77.3% vs 41.7%, P=0.045), TLR4 (100% vs 58.3%, P=0.003), and TLR2 (100% vs 50%, P=0.003) in liver biopsy samples in comparison to obese non-diabetic subjects. Obese diabetics have significantly increased TREM-1, HMGB1, RAGE, and TLRs compared to obese non-diabetics. Our findings suggest a potential pathophysiological role of TREM-1 in conjunction with HMGB1 and inflammatory cell receptors (RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2) in obesity-induced insulin resistance.

"Abstract
Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) mortality, cardiovascular (CV) complications and kidney disease progression. However, their association with clinical outcomes remains poorly evaluated. We used real-time qPCR to measure serum levels of miR-126 and miR-223 in a large cohort of 601 CKD patients (CKD stage G1 to G5 patients or on renal replacement therapy – CKD G5D) from Ghent University Hospital and 31 healthy controls. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular and renal events were registered as endpoints over a 6 year follow-up period. miR-126 levels were significantly lower from CKD stage G2 on, compared to controls. The serum levels of miR-223 were significantly lower from CKD stage G3B on. When considering overall mortality, patients with levels of either miR-126 or miR-223 below the median had a lower survival rate. Similar results were observed for CV and renal events. The observed link between the two miRNAs’ seric levels and mortality, cardiovascular events or renal events in CKD appears to depend on eGFR. However, this does not preclude their potential role in the pathophysiology of CKD. In conclusion, CKD is associated with a decrease in circulating miR-223 and miR-126 levels.",1
"Abstract
The present study investigates if mothers and fathers have similar ways of thinking and feeling about their babies during late pregnancy and how aspects of parental–fetal attachment are related to maternal depressive mood. Two hundred and ninety-eight Swedish-speaking women at 30–32 weeks of gestation and partners (n = 274) participated in the study. Socio-demographic background data were collected. Prenatal attachment was assessed with the maternal/paternal–fetal attachment scale (MFA/PFA), and depressive symptoms were assessed by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). MFA and PFA scores mirrored each other. After factor analysis, five different factors loaded somewhat differently for men were revealed as significant. These factors were (I) concerns about the fetus and health behavior, (II) mental preparation to take care of the unborn child, (III) experiences of pregnancy, (IV) experiences of fetal movements, and (V) naming of the baby. Factors III and IV were related to depressive symptoms. Mothers with slight depressive symptoms were somewhat less positive about the pregnancy but showed more attention to the fetal movements. Midwives should conduct interviews on the women’s psychosocial history and use validated instruments, which may help them to identify problems with the psychosocial health of the mother and her partner as they journey through pregnancy and transition to parenthood.",1

Purpose: Germline mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are responsible for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. At present, over thousand distinct BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been identified. Specific mutations are found to be common within particular populations, resulting from genetic founder effects. To investigate the contribution of germline mutations in these two genes to inherited breast cancer in Iran, we performed BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation analyses in ten Iranian high risk breast cancer families. This is the first study analysing the complete coding sequences of both genes that concerns the Iranian population. Methods: BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation detection included sequencing of the coding and the 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions. To detect large genomic rearrangements in the BRCA1 gene semi-quantitative multiplex PCR was performed. Results: Two pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene were detected: a novel deletion c.4415_4418delAGAA and a previously described insertion c.6033_6034insGT. In addition, one intronic variation g.5075–53C>T and a deletion/insertion g.*381_389del9ins29 in the 3′ untranslated region of BRCA1 were found in two of the investigated families. Both sequence alterations were absent in an age matched Iranian control group. The BRCA2 homozygous variation p.N372H, previously associated with an increased risk for developing breast cancer, was not identified in this study. We did not detect large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 in patients tested negatively for disease causing mutations in both genes by standard sequencing. Conclusions: At present, the BRCA2 mutations c.4415_4418delAGAA and c.6033_6034insGT have not been identified in any investigated population except the Iranian. Whether both mutations are specific for the Iranian population or a special subgroup remains to be investigated in larger studies. The absence of BRCA1 mutations in the analysed families may suggest that penetrance or prevalence of BRCA1 mutations may be lower in Iran.

Objective To gain more insight into the dynamics of
lymphocyte depletion and develop new predictors of
clinical response to rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis
(RA).
Methods RNA-based next-generation sequencing was
used to analyse the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in
peripheral blood and synovial tissue samples collected
from 24 seropositive patients with RA treated with
rituximab. Clonal expansion, mutation load and clonal
overlap were assessed in samples collected before,
at week 4 and at week 16 or 24 after treatment and
correlated to the patients’ clinical response.
Results After 4 weeks of rituximab-induced B cell
depletion, the peripheral blood BCR repertoire of
treated patients consisted of fewer, more dominant
and more mutated BCR clones. No significant changes
in the synovial tissue BCR repertoire were detected
until week 16 post-treatment, when a reduced clonal
overlap with baseline and an increased mutation load
were observed. In patients who were non-responders
at month 3 (n=5) using the European League Against
Rheumatism response criteria, peripheral blood samples
taken at week 4 after rituximab treatment showed more
dominant clones compared with moderate responders
(n=9) (median (IQR): 36 (27–52) vs 18 (16–26); p<0.01)
and more clonal overlap with the baseline (median (IQR):
5% (2%–20%) vs 0% (0%–0%); p≤0.01).
Conclusion Significant changes in BCR clonality are
observed in peripheral blood of patients 4 weeks after
rituximab treatment, while changes in synovial tissue
were observed at later time points. Incomplete depletion
of the dominant baseline peripheral blood BCR repertoire
in the first month of treatment might predict clinical nonresponse at 3 months.",1
"Summary Claudins are major tight junction proteins that regulate the integrity and function of tight
junctions. Aberrant expression of claudins has been shown in various carcinomas with diverse prognostic
implications. However, their expression pattern and prognostic value have not been investigated in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This is the first study to characterize the expression pattern of claudins 1, 4, and 7
in a cohort of 176 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a minimum follow-up of 9.4 years.
Immunohistochemistry with semiquantitative assessment of expression of claudins 1, 4, and 7 was
performed on 176 biopsy specimens. Results were correlated with sex, age, extent of tumor, lymph node
status, the presence or absence of distant metastasis, and patient survival. High expression of claudins 1 and 4
(72.2% and 88.1%) and low expression of claudin 7 (82.4%) were frequently detected. Low claudin 4
expression (P = .020) and high claudin 7 expression (P b .001) were associated with distant metastasis.
Elevated claudin 7 expression also correlated with high tumor stage (P = .001). Furthermore, decreased
claudin 4 expression (P = .003) and increased claudin 7 expression (P b .001) independently predicted
shorter distant metastasis-free survival by Cox regression analysis. Claudin 4 and claudin 7 may be a novel
biomarker for the prediction of distant metastasis and unfavorable prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

"Abstract
In this article, we report on the expression and function of a Na+-coupled transporter for citrate, NaCT, in human and rat liver cell lines and in primary hepatocytes from the rat liver. We also describe the polarized expression of this transporter in human and rat livers. Citrate uptake in human liver cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 was obligatorily dependent on Na+. The uptake system showed a preference for citrate over other intermediates of the citric acid cycle and exhibited a Michaelis constant of ∼6 mM for citrate. The transport activity was stimulated by Li+, and the activation was associated with a marked increase in substrate affinity. Citrate uptake in rat liver cell line MH1C1 was also Na+ dependent and showed a preference for citrate. The Michaelis constant for citrate was ∼10 μM. The transport activity was inhibited by Li+. Primary hepatocytes from the rat liver also showed robust activity for Na+-coupled citrate uptake, with functional features similar to those described in the rat liver cell line. Immunolabeling with a specific anti-NaCT antibody showed exclusive expression of the transporter in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes in human and rat livers. This constitutes the first report on the expression and function of NaCT in liver cells.

a sodium-coupled transporter for citrate, NaCT has been cloned from the rat brain (8), mouse brain (6), and human liver cell line HepG2 (7). It belongs to the SLC13 gene family, whose other members include sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters NaDC1 and NaDC3 and sodium-coupled sulfate transporters NaSi-1 and SUT-1 (15, 17). According to Human Genome Organization nomenclature, human NaCT is referred to as SLC13A5. NaCT is the mammalian ortholog of the “I’m not dead yet” (Indy) gene (5, 12), a critical determinant of lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster (19). However, there are important differences between mammalian and Drosophila transporters. Mammalian NaCT transports citrate and other citric acid cycle intermediates in a Na+-coupled and electrogenic manner (6–8). In contrast, even though the substrate specificity is similar, the Drosophila counterpart transports its substrates in a Na+ independent and electroneutral manner (5, 12). There are important functional differences even among mammalian NaCTs. Rat and mouse NaCTs exhibit a higher affinity for citrate [Michaelis constant (Kt): 20–40 μM] (6, 8) than does human NaCT (Kt: ∼600 μM) (7). In addition, human NaCT is stimulated by Li+, whereas rodent NaCTs are inhibited by Li+ (9). On the other hand, Caenorhabditis elegans NaCT transports citrate in a Na+-coupled and electrogenic manner (2) but is unaffected by Li+ (9).

To date, the brain is the only mammalian tissue from which NaCT has been cloned (6, 8). Subsequent studies (22, 23) have shown that the expression of the transporter in the brain is restricted to neurons. The human ortholog was cloned from HepG2 cells rather than from any native tissue (7). NaCT mRNA is most abundant in the liver and testis in the human, rat, and mouse (6–8). It has been postulated that the transporter plays a critical role in the liver by mediating the entry of citrate from the circulation (plasma concentration of citrate: ∼150 μM) into liver cells, where it may function in a variety of metabolic pathways including the citric acid cycle and synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol and also as a key regulator of glycolysis (3). Despite this hypothesized role of NaCT in hepatic metabolism, neither the expression nor the function of the transporter has been investigated in hepatocytes or in liver cell lines. The functional differences between human and rodent NaCTs, observed with the cloned transporters, have not been confirmed in native cells. Furthermore, the postulate that NaCT functions in the entry of citrate from the circulation into liver cells necessitates its expression in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes, but the localization of the transporter in the liver has not yet been established. Therefore, we undertook the present study to investigate the expression and function of NaCT in human and rat liver cell lines and in rat primary hepatocytes and to localize the transporter by immunofluorescence in human and rat livers.",1
"Background
The prevalence of diabetes has increased in the UK and other high-income countries alongside a substantial decline in cardiovascular mortality. Yet data are scarce on how these trends have changed the causes of death in people with diabetes who have traditionally died primarily of vascular causes. We estimated how all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in people with diabetes have changed over time, how the composition of the mortality burden has changed, and how this composition compared with that of the non-diabetes population.
Methods
In this epidemiological analysis of primary care records, we identified 313 907 individuals with diabetes in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a well described primary care database, between 2001 to 2018, and linked these data to UK Office for National Statistics mortality data. We assembled serial cross sections with longitudinal follow-up to generate a mixed prevalence and incidence study population of patients with diabetes. We used discretised Poisson regression models to estimate annual death rates for deaths from all causes and 12 specific causes for men and women with diabetes. We also identified age-matched and sex matched (1:1) individuals without diabetes from the same dataset and estimated mortality rates in this group.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2001, and Oct 31, 2018, total mortality declined by 32% in men and 31% in women with diagnosed diabetes. Death rates declined from 40·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 27·8 deaths per 1000 person-years in men and from 42·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 29·5 deaths per 1000 person-years in women with diagnosed diabetes. We found similar declines in individuals without diabetes, hence the gap in mortality between those with and without diabetes was maintained over the study period. Cause-specific death rates declined in ten of the 12 cause groups, with exceptions in dementia and liver disease, which increased in both populations. The large decline in vascular disease death rates led to a transition from vascular causes to cancers as the leading contributor to death rates in individuals with diagnosed diabetes and to the gap in death rates between those with and without diabetes.
Interpretation
The decline in vascular death rates has been accompanied by a diversification of causes in individuals with diagnosed diabetes and a transition from vascular diseases to cancers as the leading contributor to diabetes-related death. Clinical and preventative approaches must reflect this trend to reduce the excess mortality risk in individuals with diabetes.",1
"Abstract: Aim: Both Superion and X-Stop interspinous spacers have been approved by Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of neurogenic claudication secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). However, controversy
remains as to the difference in the improvement of clinical outcomes in moderate LSS patients treated with the
two interspinous spacers. Our purpose was to comprehensively appraise the difference. Methods: We searched
multiple databases for literature retrieval. The difference in the improvement of Zurich Claudication Questionnaire
(ZCQ) patient satisfaction, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) back pain, VAS leg pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was
assessed between the two spacers after treatment. And the difference in the occurrence rate of adverse events
between the two groups was also appraised. The Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)/risk ratio (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each parameter was estimated. Results: There was significant difference
in the improvement of ZCQ patient satisfaction and VAS back pain between the two spacers (ZCQ:SMD = 0.242, P <
0.001; VAS back pain:SMD = 0.147, P = 0.012), whereas no significant difference was detected in the improvement
of VAS leg pain and ODI, and the occurrence rate of adverse events between the two treatment. Conclusion: Our
meta-analysis suggests that moderate LSS patients receiving X-Stop interspinous spacer have significantly higher
patient satisfaction and larger reduction in the back pain severity than those implanted with Superion after surgery.

Introduction There has been a phenomenal
worldwide increase in the development and use
of mobile health applications (mHealth apps)
that monitor menstruation and fertility. Critics
argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and
lack evidence from either clinical trials or user
experience. The aim of this scoping review is to
provide an overview of the research literature
on mHealth apps that track menstruation and
fertility.
Methods This project followed the PRISMA
Extension for Scoping Reviews. The ACM,
CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus
databases were searched for material published
between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019.
Data summary and synthesis were used to chart
and analyse the data.
Results In total 654 records were reviewed.
Subsequently, 135 duplicate records and 501
records that did not meet the inclusion criteria
were removed. Eighteen records from 13
countries form the basis of this review. The
papers reviewed cover a variety of disciplinary
and methodological frameworks. Three main
themes were identified: fertility and reproductive
health tracking, pregnancy planning, and
pregnancy prevention.
Conclusions Motivations for fertility app use are
varied, overlap and change over time, although
women want apps that are accurate and
evidence-based regardless of whether they are
tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or
using the app as a form of contraception. There
is a lack of critical debate and engagement in the
development, evaluation, usage and regulation
of fertility and menstruation apps. The paucity of
evidence-based research and absence of fertility,
health professionals and users in studies is raised.",1

Objective: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequent degenerative disease representing an important health
and economic burden. Symptomatic medical treatments available include intra-articular (IA) injections
of corticosteroids (GC) but their efficacy and safety profile are debated.
Methods: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) and a meta-analysis (MA) of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of IA GC injections for knee OA. The effect of the interventions
on pain and function was extracted from the single studies and pooled. Standardized mean differences
(SMD) are reported.
Results: Of 520 studies screened, 23 were included in the SLR and 15 subsequently included in the MA.
IA GC showed a trend towards a superior effect compared to control on both pain (SMD −0.61 (95% CI:
−1.25, 0.03)) and function (SMD −1.02 (95% CI: −2.14, 0.10)) in short term follow-up (≤ 6 weeks), while
long term follow-up (≥ 24 weeks) analysis showed a trend towards superiority of controls (IA HA, IA
NSAID, physiotherapy) for pain (SMD 0.68 (95% CI: −0.11, 1.47)) and function (SMD 0.88 (95% CI: −0.36,
2.12). There were no differences between interventions in medium term (> 6 weeks & < 24 weeks).
Conclusion: In this work, IA GC injections reduced pain and improved function early after administration
(≤ 6 weeks) compared to placebo; while this result was no longer statistically significant with other
comparators (IA hyaluronic acid or physiotherapy). Other interventions seem to be more efficient in the
long term (≥ 24 weeks) but this effect was largely driven by single studies with large effect sizes.

"ABSTRACT
Genotype data from dairy cattle selection programs have greatly facilitated GWAS to identify variants related to economic traits. Results can enhance the accuracy of genomic prediction, analyze more complex models that go beyond additive effects, elucidate the genetic architecture of a trait, and finally, decipher the underlying biology of traits. The entire process, comprising data generation, quality control, statistical analyses, interpretation of association results, and linking results to biology should be designed and executed to minimize the generation of false-positive and false-negative associations and misleading links to biological processes. This review aims to provide general guidelines for data analysis that address data quality control, association tests, adjustment for population stratification, and significance evaluation to improve the reliability of conclusions. We also provide guidance on post-GWAS strategy and the interpretation of results. These guidelines are tailored to dairy cattle, which are characterized by long-range linkage disequilibrium, large half-sib families, and routinely collected phenotypes, requiring different approaches than those applied in human GWAS. We discuss common limitations and challenges that have been overlooked in the analysis and interpretation of GWAS to identify candidate sequence variants in dairy cattle.",1
"Abstract
Exposure to media coverage of mass violence has been shown to predict poorer mental
health symptomology. However, it is unknown whether such media coverage can have ubiquitous effects on average community members, extending to biological and perceptual processes that underlie everyday decision making and behavior. Here, we used a repeatedmeasures design over the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings to track participants’ self-reported distress, their eye blink startle reactivity while viewing images of the
bombings, and their ability to perceptually distinguish armed from unarmed individuals in a
behavioral shooting task. We leveraged a computational linguistics method in which we
sampled news content from the sources our participants most commonly self-reported reading, and then quantified both the extent of news coverage about the marathon and the affective tone of that news coverage. Results revealed that participants experienced greater
current distress, greater physiological reactivity to threats, and poorer perceptual sensitivity
when recent news coverage of the marathon contained more affectively negative words.
This is the first empirical work to examine relationships between the media’s affective tone
in its coverage of mass violence and individuals’ threat perception and physiological threat
reactivity.",1
"Abstract
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to recanalization of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
play regulatory roles in functions of EPCs, which is becoming a promising therapeutic choice for thrombus resolution. The
main purpose of this study was to explore the efect of miR-125a-5p on EPC functions in deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
EPCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with DVT. In DVT mouse models, DVT was induced by stenosis
of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The levels of miR-125a-5p and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) in EPCs and
thrombi of DVT mice were detected by RT-qPCR. EPC migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were estimated by Transwell
assay, tube formation assay, and fow cytometry analysis. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized for detecting the binding of
miR-125a-5p and MCL-1. The phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT was estimated by western blot. DVT formation in vivo
was observed through hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining. The expression of thrombus resolution marker, CD34 molecule
(CD34), in the thrombi was measured by immunofuorescence staining. MiR-125a-5p upregulation repressed EPC migration
and angiogenesis and facilitated apoptosis. MiR-125a-5p downregulation showed the opposite efect. MCL-1 was targeted
and negatively regulated by miR-125a-5p. Additionally, miR-125a-5p inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in EPCs. Inhibition
of MCL-1 or PI3K/AKT pathway reversed the efect of miR-125a-5p knockdown on EPC functions. The in vivo experiments
revealed that miR-125a-5p downregulation repressed thrombus formation and promoted the homing capability of EPCs to the
thrombosis site, thereby alleviating DVT mice. Downregulation of miR-125a-5p promotes EPC migration and angiogenesis
by upregulating MCL-1, thereby enhancing EPC homing to thrombi and facilitating thrombus resolution.

Abstract
Background
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that causes significant public health problems in tropical countries. Schistosoma haematobium species are blamable for causing urinary schistosomiasis. The infected person, specifically children, may be carrying the disease. This systematic review aimed to identify the current knowledge of urinary Schistosmiasis in children or USC on its epidemiology, risk factors, and challenges to spread the understanding of controlling the disease and reducing the complications.

Method
In November 2021, a systematic computer-aided literature review was conducted using PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The results were updated in February 2022. We only used papers that have at least the abstract available in English. Relevant articles were screened, duplicates were deleted, eligibility criteria were applied, and studies that met the criteria were reviewed. The keywords Human Schistosoma infections, prevalence, risk factors and challenges were included. The protocol for the review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022311609). Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using the programme R version 4.2.1. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and p-value. A narrative approach was used to describe risk factors and challenges. Studies were selected and finalised based on the review question to prioritise. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed-Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT).

Results
A total of 248 publications met the requirements for inclusion. Fifteen articles were included in this review, with the result showing high heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in children is 4% (95% confidence interval (CI)). Age, poor socioeconomic status, education, exposure to river water, and poor sanitation are the risk factors identified in this review. Challenges are faced due to limitations of clean water, lack of water resources, and poor hygiene.

Conclusion
Modifiable risk factors such as poor knowledge and practices must be addressed immediately. Healthcare providers and schools could accomplish engaging in practical promotional activities. Communicating the intended messages to raise community awareness of urinary schistosomiasis is critical.

"A simple design for a copolarization wideband metamaterial absorber (MA) for
C-band applications is proposed. The unit cell of the proposed MA is designed
by combining half-moon-shaped resonator and interior circle resonator
structures, on flame retardant 4 substrate. The absorption performance of the
proposed absorber is investigated using Computer Simulation Technology
Microwave Studio simulations. The MA design parameters are optimized
based on analysis of the equivalent circuit model. The designed absorber
achieves copolarization absorptivity above 90% across the entire C-band from
3.95 GHz to 8.02 GHz under normal incidence for transverse electric (TE) and
transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. Moreover, the average absorption
remains above 80% even for angles of incidence up to 60 under both TE and
TM polarizations. The physical mechanism of the MA is investigated by using
the electric and surface current distributions, which is also supported by the
retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters. The designed structure is
compact (unit cell dimension of  k/6.5 and thickness of  k/11.8 at the center
frequency), broadband, and insensitive to the angle of incidence across a wide
range, enabling applications in C-band defense and stealth systems.",1
"Abstract
Background: Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia are the main asbestos-producing countries, and all forms of
asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. The objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden attributable to
asbestos between 1990 and 2019 in major producing countries, including Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
Methods: Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates
(ASDR) of disease burden attributable to asbestos by country, age, and sex were extracted from the Global Burden of
Disease 2019. Percentage change and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were used to assess the trends of
ASDR and ASMR of disease burden attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019.
Results: Asbestos-related diseases were highly heterogeneous across Global, Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
There was a downward trend in ASMR and ASDR of diseases burden related to asbestos globally. The age-specifc
mortality rate of disease attributable to asbestos increased in men and women, although it decreased in women
aged 85–89, the highest age-specifc mortality rate were observed in age 95+group in men [162.14 (95% UI: 103.76–
215.45)] and women [30.58 (95% UI: 14.83–44.33)] per 100 000 population, respectively. Tracheal, bronchus, and lung
(TBL) cancer was the leading cause of death and DALYS attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019 globally and
in Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. China had the highest percentage change (73.31%) and EAPC [3.41 (95% CI:
2.75–4.08)] in ASMR related to exposure to asbestos in men, with the highest percentage change (73.31%) and EAPC
[3.41 (95% CI: 2.75–4.08)] in ASDR in men.
Conclusions: The ASMR and ASDR of disease burden attributable to asbestos decreased between 1990 and 2019
globally. TBL cancer was the leading cause of death and DALYs attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019. There
has been an increasing trend in mortality and DALYs globally, especially in older men. The burden of disease attributable to asbestos is increasing in China, especially in men.

"Abstract
Background
For patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms, the preferred treatment is proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration for approximately 8 weeks. However, long-term use of PPIs can cause gut microbiome (GM) disturbances. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of probiotics combined with a PPI on the GM and gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Method
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 120 eligible patients with GERD will be randomized into the experimental group or the control group. The treatment includes two phases: the initial treatment period lasts 8 weeks (weeks 1–8), and the maintenance treatment period lasts 4 weeks (weeks 9–12). During the initial treatment period, the experimental group will take rabeprazole and LiHuo probiotics, and the control group will take rabeprazole and a probiotic placebo; during the maintenance treatment period, the experimental group will take LiHuo probiotics, and the control group will take a probiotic placebo. The primary measure is the change in the GM. The secondary measures are the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) score, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score, faecal metabolome (FM), body mass index, Los Angeles grade of oesophagitis, adverse event (AE) rate and treatment compliance. Each outcome indicator will be assessed at day 0 (before administration), day 28 and/or 56 (during administration), and day 84 (end of administration) to reveal intragroup differences. AEs will be monitored to assess the safety of LiHuo probiotics.

Discussion
This will be the first trial to use the intestinal flora metagene method to analyse the effects of probiotics on patients with GERD receiving long-term PPI treatment. The goal is to provide evidence for the use of probiotics to reduce intestinal flora disorders and other symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort in patients with GERD who have used PPIs for a long period.",1
"Background: At present, laboratory blood tests to support major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis are not available. This study aimed to screen potential mRNAs for peripheral blood biomarkers and novel pathophysiology of MDD.

Methods: The present study utilized public data from two mRNA microarray datasets to analyze the hub genes changes related to MDD. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed. Finally, some potential mRNA quality biomarkers for hub gene expression in blood were identified.

Results: A total of 25 significantly co-upregulated DEGs and 98 co-downregulated DEGs were obtained from two datasets. The pathway enrichment analyses showed that co-upregulated genes were significantly enriched in the regulation of cell-matrix adhesion and mitochondrial membrane permeability which were involved in the apoptotic process. Co-downregulated genes were mainly involved in the neutrophil activation which in turn was involved in the immune response, degranulation and cell-mediated immunity, positive regulation of immune response, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. From the PPI network, 14 hub genes were obtained. Among them, the subnetworks of PLCG1, BCL2A1, TLR8, FADD, and TLR4 screened out from our study have been shown to play a role in immune and inflammation responses.

Discussion: The potential molecular mechanisms that have been identified simultaneously include innate immunity, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic factors for synapse function and development.",1
"BACKGROUND: While disease-modifying therapies exist for heart failure (HF)
with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), few options are available
for patients in the higher range of LVEF (>40%). Sacubitril/valsartan has been
compared with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–system inhibitor alone in 2
similarly designed clinical trials of patients with reduced and preserved LVEF,
permitting examination of its effects across the full spectrum of LVEF.
METHODS: We combined data from PARADIGM-HF (LVEF eligibility≤40%;
n=8399) and PARAGON-HF (LVEF eligibility≥45%; n=4796) in a prespecified pooled
analysis. We divided randomized patients into LVEF categories: ≤22.5% (n=1269),
>22.5% to 32.5% (n=3987), >32.5% to 42.5% (n=3143), > 42.5% to 52.5%
(n=1427), > 52.5% to 62.5% (n=2166), and >62.5% (n=1202). We assessed
time to first cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, its components, and total
heart failure hospitlizations, all-cause mortality, and noncardiovascular mortality.
Incidence rates and treatment effects were examined across categories of LVEF.
RESULTS: Among 13195 randomized patients, we observed lower rates of
cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, but similar rates of noncardiovascular
death, among patients in the highest versus the lowest groups. Overall sacubitril/
valsartan was superior to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–system inhibition for
first cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.84
[95% CI, 0.78–0.90]), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76–0.92]), heart
failure hospitalization (HR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.77–0.91]), and all-cause mortality (HR
0.88 [95% CI, 0.81–0.96]). The effect of sacubitril/valsartan was modified by LVEF
(treatment-by-continuous LVEF interaction P=0.02), and benefit appeared to be
present for individuals with EF primarily below the normal range, although the
treatment benefit for cardiovascular death diminished at a lower ejection fraction.
We observed effect modification by LVEF on the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan in
both men and women with respect to composite total HF hospitalizations and
cardiovascular death, although women derived benefit to higher ejection fractions.
CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effects of sacubitril/valsartan, compared with
a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–system inhibitor alone, vary by LVEF with
treatment benefits, particularly for heart failure hospitalization, that appear to
extend to patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction. These
therapeutic benefits appeared to extend to a higher LVEF range in women
compared with men.

"Abstract
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine application to the umbilical cord in neonates. We searched MEDLINE and other electronic databases, and included all RCTs that evaluated the effect of single or multiple chlorhexidine cord applications on the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and/or the incidence of systemic sepsis and omphalitis. A total of six RCTs—four community-based cluster RCTs and two hospital-based trials—were included in the review. Of the four cluster RCTs, three were conducted in South Asia in settings with high rates of home births (>92%) while the fourth, available only as an abstract, was conducted in Africa. Pooled analysis by the ‘intention-to-treat’ principle showed a significant reduction in NMR after chlorhexidine application (four studies; relative risk (RR) 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.95; fixed effects (FE) model). On subgroup analysis, only multiple applications showed a significant effect (four studies; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99) whereas a single application did not (one study; RR 0.86; 0.73 to 1.02). Similarly, only the community-based trials showed a significant reduction in NMR (three studies; RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95), while the hospital-based study did not find any effect (RR 0.11; 0.01 to 2.03). Since all the studies were conducted in high-NMR settings (⩾30 per 1000 live births), we could not determine the effect in settings with low NMRs. Only one study—a hospital-based trial from India—reported the incidence of neonatal sepsis; it did not find a significant reduction in any sepsis (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.28). Pooled analysis of community-based studies revealed significant reduction in the risk of omphalitis in infants who received the intervention (four studies; RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81). The hospital-based trial had no instances of omphalitis in either of the two groups. Chlorhexidine application delayed the time to cord separation (four studies; mean difference 2.11 days; 95% CI 2.07 to 2.15; FE model). Chlorhexidine application to the cord reduces the risk of neonatal mortality and omphalitis in infants born at home in high-NMR settings. Routine chlorhexidine application, preferably daily for 7 to 10 days after birth, should therefore be recommended in these infants. Given the paucity of evidence, there is presently no justification for recommending this intervention in infants born in health facilities and/or low-NMR settings.

"Abstract
IMPORTANCE Wearable physical activity (PA) trackers, such as accelerometers, fitness trackers, and
pedometers, are accessible technologies that may encourage increased PA levels in line with current
recommendations. However, whether their use is associated with improvements in PA levels in
participants who experience 1 or more cardiometabolic conditions, such as diabetes, prediabetes,
obesity, and cardiovascular disease, is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of interventions using wearable PA trackers (accelerometers,
fitness trackers, and pedometers) with PA levels and other health outcomes in adults with
cardiometabolic conditions.
DATA SOURCES For this systematic review and meta-analysis, searches of MEDLINE, Embase,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO were performed from January 1, 2000,
until December 31, 2020, with no language restriction. A combination of Medical Subject Heading
terms and text words of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, pedometers, accelerometers, and
Fitbits were used.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials or cluster randomized clinical trials that evaluated the
use of wearable PA trackers, such as pedometers, accelerometers, or fitness trackers, were included.
Trials were excluded if they assessed the trackers only as measuring tools of PA before and after
another intervention, they required participants to be hospitalized, assessors were not blinded to the
trackers, or they used a tracker to measure the effect of a pharmacological treatment on PA among
individuals.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. A random-effects model was
used for the meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was mean difference in PA levels. When
the scale was different across studies, standardized mean differences were calculated.
Heterogeneity was quantified using the I
2 statistic and explored using mixed-effects metaregression.
RESULTS A total of 38 randomized clinical trials with 4203 participants were eligible in the
systematic review; 29 trials evaluated pedometers, and 9 evaluated accelerometers or fitness
trackers. Four studies did not provide amenable outcome data, leaving 34 trials (3793 participants)
for the meta-analysis. Intervention vs comparator analysis showed a significant association of
wearable tracker use with increased PA levels overall (standardized mean difference, 0.72; 95% CI,
0.46-0.97; I
2 = 88%; 95% CI, 84.3%-90.8%; P < .001) in studies with short to medium follow-up for median of 15 (range, 12-52) weeks. Multivariable metaregression showed an association between
increased PA levels and interventions that involved face-to-face consultations with facilitators (23
studies; β = −0.04; 95% CI, −0.11 to −0.01), included men (23 studies; β = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.01-0.96),
and assessed pedometer-based interventions (26 studies; β = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.02-0.32).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, interventions that
combined wearable activity trackers with health professional consultations were associated with
significant improvements in PA levels among people with cardiometabolic conditions.",1
"ABSTRACT
Objective To investigate the short-term efficacy difference between femoral neck system and cannulated compression screw in the treatment of femoral neck fracture in young and middle-aged patients.

Methods Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and CBM databases were searched. All literature on the treatment of femoral neck fractures using the femoral neck system (FNS) or cannulated compression screw (CCS). RevMan 5.4.1 software was used to analyze data.

Results Twelve high-quality cohort studies were included, including 787 patients treated surgically for femoral neck fractures, of whom 369 were treated with FNS and 418 with CCS. Results of meta-analysis showed that FNS had shorter operative time than CCS for femoral neck fracture [ WMD =-8.09, 95% CI (-14.12, -2.06), P =0.009]. FNS had less intraoperative blood loss [ WMD =6.63, 95% CI (1.42, 11.83), P =0.010], Partial weight-bearing time of FNS was earlier postoperative [ WMD =-2.11, 95% CI (-3.00, -1.22), P <0.001], while full weight-bearing time was also earlier postoperative [ WMD =1.01, 95% CI (1.59, 0.43), P <0.001), The postoperative fracture healing time of FNS was shorter [ SMD =0.67, 95% CI (1.04, 0.30), P <0.001]. The Harris score of FNS at the last follow-up was higher [ WMD =4.67, 95% CI (3.26, 6.08), P <0.001]. The number of fluoroscopy during FNS was less [ WMD =-9.05, 95% CI (-10.92, -7.18), P <0.001]. The rate of severe femoral neck shortening after FNS was lower [ RR =0.36, 95% CI (0.19, 0.70), P =0.002]. The incidence of postoperative complications after FNS, including urinary tract infection, venous thromboembolism, bone nonunion, screw loosening, femoral head avascular necrosis, was lower [ RR =0.38, 95% CI (0.27, 0.53), P <0.001]. There was no difference in postoperative hospital stay between FNS and CCS [ WMD =0.01, 95% CI (-0.36, 0.39), P =0.950]. There was no difference in fracture reduction quality (Garden I) [ RR =1.04, 95% CI (0.87, 1.24), P =0.660]. There was no difference in fracture reduction quality (Garden II) [ RR =0.91, 95% CI (0.59, 1.39), P=0.650]. There was no difference in postoperative moderate femoral neck shortening [ RR =0.85, 95% CI (0.58, 1.26), P =0.430].

Conclusion Compared with cannulated compression screw, femoral neck system had shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss, earlier postoperative part load or full load time, shorter fracture healing time higher Harris score at the last follow-up, less number of intraoperative fluoroscopy, and lower rate of severe femoral neck shortening. Besides, FNS had a lower incidence of postoperative complications including urinary tract infection, venous thromboembolism, bone nonunion, screw loosening, and avascular necrosis of femoral head than CCS.",1
"Abstract
Propofol is the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic worldwide. It can induce loss of consciousness prior to the occurrence of severe respiratory suppression, which is also a pharmacodynamic feature of all general anesthetics. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this natural phenomenon are controversial and highly related to patient safety. In the present study, we demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic effects of propofol (50 and 100 μM) on suppression of consciousness-related excitatory postsynaptic currents in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) were lower than those in the kernel respiratory rhythmogenesis nucleus pre-Bötzinger complex (PrBo). Furthermore, we unexpectedly found that the GABAA receptor β3 subunit is the key target for propofol’s action and that it is mutually and exclusively expressed in GABAergic neurons. It is also more abundant in the mPFC and CMT, but mainly co-localized with GABAergic neurons in the PrBo. As a result, the differentiated expression pattern should mediate more neuron suppression through the activation of GABAergic neurons in the mPFC and CMT at low doses of propofol (50 μM). However, PrBo GABAergic neurons were only activated by propofol at a high dose (100 μM). These results highlight the detailed pharmacodynamic effects of propofol on consciousness-related and respiration-related nuclei and provide the distinct interaction mechanism between the β3 subunit and GABAergic neurons in mediating the suppression of consciousness compared to the inhibition of respiration.",1

Background
As a key component in artificial intelligence computing, a transistor design is updated here as a potential alternative candidate for artificial synaptic behavior implementation. However, further updates are needed to better control artificial synaptic behavior. Here, an updated channel-electrode transistor design is proposed as an artificial synapse device; this structure is different from previously published designs by other groups.

Methods
A semiconductor characterization system was used in order to simulate the artificial synaptic behavior and a scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the device structure.

Results
It was found that the electrode added to the transistor channel had a strong impact on the representative transmission behavior of such artificial synaptic devices, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) index.

Conclusion
These behaviors were tuned effectively and the impact of the channel electrode is explained by the combined effects of the joint channel electrode and conventional gate. The voltage dependence of such oxide devices suggests more capability to emulate various synaptic behaviors for numerous medical and non-medical applications. This is extremely helpful for future neuromorphic computational system implementation.",1
"Abstract
This study aims to investigate the mechanism of tumor-derived exosomal (EVs) SNHG16 in promoting the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of SNHG16, miR-23b-5p and MCM6 in NPC. MTT, flow cytometry and transwell were used to detect the effects of them on the proliferation, cycle, apoptosis and invasion ability of NPC. Transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting and BCA were used to verify the regulation of exosome secretion under different oxygen environments. Our results showed that hypoxia induces tumor-derived exosome SNHG16 to mediate NPC progression through the miR-23b-5p/MCM6 pathway.",1

Background—
Emerging studies suggest that early administration of dual antiplatelet therapy may be better than monotherapy for prevention of early recurrent stroke and cardiovascular outcomes in acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials evaluating dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy for acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA.
Methods and Results—
We assessed randomized, controlled trials investigating dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy published up to November 2012 and the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events), for efficacy and safety outcomes in adult patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA with treatment initiated within 3 days of ictus. In total, 14 studies of 9012 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Dual antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced risk of stroke recurrence (risk ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.80; P<0.001) and the composite outcome of stroke, TIA, acute coronary syndrome, and all death (risk ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.81; P<0.001) when compared with monotherapy, and nonsignificantly increased risk of major bleeding (risk ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–2.59, P=0.37). Analyses restricted to the CHANCE Trial or the 7 double-blind randomized, controlled trials showed similar results.
Conclusions—
For patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, dual therapy was more effective than monotherapy in reducing risks of early recurrent stroke. The results of the CHANCE study are consistent with previous studies done in other parts of the world.",1
"Abstract
Werner syndrome is caused by mutations in the DNA repair Werner helicase (WRN) gene and characterized by accelerated aging including cataracts. Age-related cataract (ARC) cases (N = 504) and controls (N = 244) were recruited from a population-based study to evaluate the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of WRN and another DNA repair gene (human 8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1) with ARC. Among the five SNPs tested, only WRN rs1346044 was found to be significantly associated between cases and controls before multiple-testing adjustment. The minor C allele of rs1346044 was associated with ARC with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.66, suggesting a protective role of the C allele for developing ARC. The stratification analysis on the subtypes of ARC showed that rs1346044 was significantly associated with cortical cataract, but not with nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and mixed types after multiple-testing adjustment (OR = 0.51, p < 0.01). The genetic model analysis showed that the results fit the dominant model (OR = 0.44, p < 0.001). The comet assay used to assess the extent of DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes of ARC cases found that the DNA damage in lymphocytes from patients with CC genotype was significantly less than that in patients with TT genotype. We concluded that the C allele of rs1346044, a non-synonymous SNP resulting in the conversion of Cys to Arg at amino acid position 1367 of WRN, alters susceptibility to ARC, especially the cortical type of the disease, in the Han Chinese. The underlying mechanism of its protective role might be related to the improved DNA repair function.",1
"We introduce three modifications to the die-in-a-cup paradigm to gain novel insights into dishonest behavior under time pressure. The regular die is substituted with a custom one that has a distinct color on each side as a way of manipulating familiarity with the decision situation. The cup is substituted with a ‘dice tower' to control the randomization process. Alongside outcome data, we capture mouse cursor trajectories. Results from our preregistered laboratory experiment involving 229 subjects suggest that time pressure increases dishonesty only when the regular die is used. Mouse tracking analysis suggests that it takes more effort to be honest than to lie outright and that partial lying is most difficult.

"Abstract
Human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) are restricted in proliferative capacity in vivo. Reduction in the number of hCEC leads to persistent corneal edema requiring corneal transplantation. This study demonstrates the functions of SIRT1 in hCECs and its potential for corneal endothelial regeneration. Cell morphology, cell growth rates and proliferation-associated proteins were compared in normal and senescent hCECs. SIRT1 was activated using the CRISPR/dCas9 activation system (SIRT1a). The plasmids were transfected into CECs of six-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats using electroporation and cryoinjury was performed. Senescent cells were larger, elongated and showed lower proliferation rates and lower SIRT1 levels. SIRT1 activation promoted the wound healing of CECs. In vivo transfection of SIRT1a promoted the regeneration of CECs. The proportion of the S-phase cells was lower in senescent cells and elevated upon SIRT1a activation. SIRT1 regulated cell proliferation, proliferation-associated proteins, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxidative stress levels. In conclusion, corneal endothelial senescence is related with a decreased SIRT1 level. SIRT1a promotes the regeneration of CECs by inhibiting cytokine-induced cell death and senescence. Gene function activation therapy using SIRT1a may serve as a novel treatment strategy for hCEC diseases.",1
"Abstract
Background. One of the most important recent discoveries in brain glioma biology has been the identification of
the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status as markers for therapy and prognosis.
1p/19q co-deletion is the defining genomic marker for oligodendrogliomas and confers a better prognosis and
treatment response than gliomas without it. Our group has previously developed a highly accurate deep-learning
network for determining IDH mutation status using T2-weighted (T2w) MRI only. The purpose of this study was to
develop a similar 1p/19q deep-learning classification network.
Methods. Multiparametric brain MRI and corresponding genomic information were obtained for 368 subjects
from The Cancer Imaging Archive and The Cancer Genome Atlas. 1p/19 co-deletions were present in 130 subjects.
Two-hundred and thirty-eight subjects were non-co-deleted. A T2w image-only network (1p/19q-net) was developed to perform 1p/19q co-deletion status classification and simultaneous single-label tumor segmentation using
3D-Dense-UNets. Three-fold cross-validation was performed to generalize the network performance. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was also performed. Dice scores were computed to determine tumor segmentation
accuracy.
Results. 1p/19q-net demonstrated a mean cross-validation accuracy of 93.46% across the 3 folds (93.4%, 94.35%,
and 92.62%, SD = 0.8) in predicting 1p/19q co-deletion status with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 ± 0.003 and
0.95 ± 0.01, respectively and a mean area under the curve of 0.95 ± 0.01. The whole tumor segmentation mean Dice
score was 0.80 ± 0.007.
Conclusion. We demonstrate high 1p/19q co-deletion classification accuracy using only T2w MR images. This represents an important milestone toward using MRI to predict glioma histology, prognosis, and response to treatment.",1
"Background 
Syphilis diagnosis relies on serological tests, which may be falsely nonreactive or may be reactive but not reflect current syphilis.

Methods 
Polymerase chain reaction for detection of T. pallidum DNA was performed on 123 oropharyngeal swabs, 120 whole bloods, and 46 lesion exudate swabs from 123 untreated individuals with syphilis (cases); oropharyngeal swabs from 148 at-risk controls without syphilis; and 73 oropharyngeal swabs and 36 whole bloods from 73 individuals recently treated for syphilis.

Results 
Most (90.2%) cases had early syphilis. T. pallidum DNA was detected in 33 (26.8%) of 123 oropharyngeal swabs, 32 (26.7%) of 120 bloods, and 30 (65.2%) of 46 lesion exudate swabs. T. pallidum DNA was detected in 49 (40.8%) of 120 individuals in whom both oropharyngeal swabs and blood were tested. T. pallidum was more likely to be amplified from oropharyngeal swabs when it was amplified from blood than when it was not (15 of 32 [46.9%] vs. 17 of 88 [19.3%], P = 0.003). For each 2-fold increase in serum rapid plasma reagin titer, the odds of detection of T. pallidum DNA in oropharyngeal swabs increased by 1.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.82, P = 0.003). T. pallidum DNA was not detected in oropharyngeal samples from controls, but it was detected in 3 (8.3%) of 36 bloods from individuals recently treated for syphilis: 2 at 1 day and 1 at 5 days after initiation of syphilis treatment.

Conclusions 
Nucleic amplification tests can identify recent T. pallidum infection and may be particularly useful for diagnosis of very early or asymptomatic syphilis.",1
"Abstract
Purpose
Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) with activity in HER2-amplified metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Its role in non–HER2-amplified MBC remains unclear. EGF30001, a phase III trial of lapatinib and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel and placebo, demonstrated lapatinib does not significantly benefit HER2-negative or HER2-unselected patients with MBC. Published data support interactions between steroid hormone and peptide growth factor signaling. We hypothesized that molecular subgroups may exist within EGF30001 that would benefit from lapatinib.
Methods
A blinded, retrospective biomarker evaluation was performed using immunohistochemistry to semiquantitate estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and EGFR expression. HER2 amplification was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Effects of these biomarkers on event-free survival (EFS) were examined in patients with available tissue (n = 493).
Results
Lapatinib improved median EFS in HER2-amplified, ER- or PR-positive MBC (n = 36; 5.7 v 4.5 months; P = .351); benefit was greater and statistically significant in HER2-amplified, ER-negative, PR-negative MBC (n = 42; 8.3 v 5.0 months; P = .007). In HER2-negative, ER-positive MBC, median EFS improvement varied by degree of PR expression (H-score): no benefit if PR-strong (n = 133; 9.3 v 7.3 months; P = .373), benefit if PR-weak (n = 50; 7.3 v 2.4 months; P = .026), and potential antagonism if PR-negative (n = 40; 3.7 v 7.2 months; P = .004). No benefit was seen in triple-negative MBC (n = 131; median EFS, 4.6 v 4.8 months; P = .255). EGFR expression was not correlated with benefit from lapatinib.
Conclusion
Although subgroups are small, these analyses support the hypothesis that semiquantitative determination of hormone receptor status may be a surrogate for EGFR and/or HER2 dependency.",1
"Abstract
Ipriflavone (IPRI), an isoflavone derivative, is clinically used to prevent postmenopausal bone loss in addition to its antioxidant and cognitive benefits. However, its poor aqueous solubility retained its bioavailability. New strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and solubility of neurological medications to enhance their potency and limit adverse effects. This study aimed to prepare targeted IPRI-poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles coupled with Tet-1 peptide to increase the therapeutic potency of IPRI in a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Streptozotocin (STZ) exacerbates Alzheimer-related alterations by promoting central insulin resistance resulted from defective signaling pathways related to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of STZ was used to introduce the AD model. Icv-STZ injection significantly affected brain insulin, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic indicators and caused behavioral abnormalities. STZ promoted the formation of amyloid β42 (Aβ42) by increasing BACE1 and reducing ADAM10 and ADAM17 expression levels. STZ also triggered the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction, which are crucial for neurological impairments. Icv-STZ injection showed evident degenerative changes in the pyramidal cell layer and significantly reduced the count of viable cells in both CA1 and prefrontal cortex, indicating increased neuronal cell death. IPRI successfully ameliorated cognitive dysfunction by improving the phosphorylated forms of cAMP-response element-binding protein (pCREB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) related to synaptic plasticity. Targeted IPRI nanoparticles exceeded free IPRI potential in reducing oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase/monoamine oxidase activities, Tau phosphorylation, and Aβ42 levels revealing less degenerative changes and increased viable neuron counts. IPRI-targeted nanoparticles improved the neuroprotective potential of free IPRI, making this strategy applicable to treat many neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the in silico study predicted its ability to cross the BBB and to bind various protein targets in the brain.",1

17 The dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DLX6-AS1 has been identified to be
18 involved in the development of several cancers, but its functional role and the underlying
19 mechanism of DLX6-AS1 in breast cancer (BC) remains unknown. In the current study, the
20 expression of DLX6-AS1 in the BC tissue samples was evaluated and the correlation between
21 DLX6-AS1 expression and clinicopathological parameters were also analyzed. We found that
22 DLX6-AS1 expression was much higher in tumor tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues
23 and was positively associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. DLX6-AS1 knockdown
24 significantly suppressed BC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and promoted apoptosis.
25 Moreover, luciferase reporter assay validated that DLX6-AS1 acted as an endogenous sponge
26 to miR-505-3p and negatively regulated its expression. Additionally, miR-505-3p inhibited
27 runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression by directly bind to its 3’- untranslated
28 region (3’-UTR) and overexpression of RUNX2 partially reversed the effect of miR-505-3p
29 mimics on BC cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, in BC tissues, miR-505-3p
30 expression level was inversely associated with DLX6-AS1 and RUNX2, respectively. In
31 conclusion, these findings demonstrated that DLX6-AS1 functioned as an oncogenic role that
32 promoted BC proliferation and invasion through miR-505-3p/RUNX2 axis, which might
33 serve as a potential therapeutic target for BC treatment.

"Abstract
Importance  Intravenous magnesium sulfate administered to pregnant individuals before birth at less than 30 weeks’ gestation reduces the risk of death and cerebral palsy in their children. The effects at later gestational ages are unclear.

Objective  To determine whether administration of magnesium sulfate at 30 to 34 weeks’ gestation reduces death or cerebral palsy at 2 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This randomized clinical trial enrolled pregnant individuals expected to deliver at 30 to 34 weeks’ gestation and was conducted at 24 Australian and New Zealand hospitals between January 2012 and April 2018.

Intervention  Intravenous magnesium sulfate (4 g) was compared with placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was death (stillbirth, death of a live-born infant before hospital discharge, or death after hospital discharge before 2 years’ corrected age) or cerebral palsy (loss of motor function and abnormalities of muscle tone and power assessed by a pediatrician) at 2 years’ corrected age. There were 36 secondary outcomes that assessed the health of the pregnant individual, infant, and child.

Results  Of the 1433 pregnant individuals enrolled (mean age, 30.6 [SD, 6.6] years; 46 [3.2%] self-identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, 237 [16.5%] as Asian, 82 [5.7%] as Māori, 61 [4.3%] as Pacific, and 966 [67.4%] as White) and their 1679 infants, 1365 (81%) offspring (691 in the magnesium group and 674 in the placebo group) were included in the primary outcome analysis. Death or cerebral palsy at 2 years’ corrected age was not significantly different between the magnesium and placebo groups (3.3% [23 of 691 children] vs 2.7% [18 of 674 children], respectively; risk difference, 0.61% [95% CI, −1.27% to 2.50%]; adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.65 to 2.18]). Components of the primary outcome did not differ between groups. Neonates in the magnesium group were less likely to have respiratory distress syndrome vs the placebo group (34% [294 of 858] vs 41% [334 of 821], respectively; adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.95]) and chronic lung disease (5.6% [48 of 858] vs 8.2% [67 of 821]; adjusted RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.99]) during the birth hospitalization. No serious adverse events occurred; however, adverse events were more likely in pregnant individuals who received magnesium vs placebo (77% [531 of 690] vs 20% [136 of 667], respectively; adjusted RR, 3.76 [95% CI, 3.22 to 4.39]). Fewer pregnant individuals in the magnesium group had a cesarean delivery vs the placebo group (56% [406 of 729] vs 61% [427 of 704], respectively; adjusted RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99]), although more in the magnesium group had a major postpartum hemorrhage (3.4% [25 of 729] vs 1.7% [12 of 704] in the placebo group; adjusted RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.01 to 3.91]).

"abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
induced preterm delivery. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS in the presence or absence of previous TLR4 blockade was performed to establish
a murine model of preterm delivery. The incidences of preterm delivery and fetal death were calculated. Flow cytometry was performed to
examine the percentages of blood CD45þCD86þ, CD3þCD69þ, CD19þCD69þ and CD49bþCD69þ cell subsets, and the percentages of
placenta CD45þCD86þ, CD45þCD49bþ and CD49bþCD69þ cell subpopulations. In our study, an inflammation-induced preterm delivery
model was established by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Blocking TLR4 significantly decreased LPS-induced preterm delivery and fetal death.
LPS treatment markedly up-regulated the percentages of blood CD45þCD86þ, CD3þCD69þ and CD49bþCD69þ cells, and of placenta
CD45þCD86þ, CD45þCD49bþ and CD49bþCD69þ cells. TLR4 blockade almost completely abrogated LPS-induced elevated cell proportions. These data demonstrate that TLR4 plays a critical role in inflammation-induced preterm delivery.

"Abstract
Despite increasing representation in graduate training programs, a disproportionate number of women leave academic research without obtaining an independent position that enables them to train the next generation of academic researchers. To understand factors underlying this trend, we analyzed formal PhD and postdoctoral mentoring relationships in the life sciences during the years 2000 to 2020. Student and mentor gender are both associated with differences in rates of student’s continuation to positions that allow formal academic mentorship. Although trainees of women mentors are less likely to take on positions as academic mentors than trainees of men mentors, this effect is reduced substantially after controlling for several measurements of mentor status. Thus, the effect of mentor gender can be explained at least partially by gender disparities in social and financial resources available to mentors. Because trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender, this association between mentor gender and academic continuation disproportionately impacts women trainees. On average, gender homophily in graduate training is unrelated to mentor status. A notable exception to this trend is the special case of scientists having been granted an outstanding distinction, evidenced by membership in the National Academy of Sciences, being a grantee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or having been awarded the Nobel Prize. This group of mentors trains men graduate students at higher rates than their most successful colleagues. These results suggest that, in addition to other factors that limit career choices for women trainees, gender inequities in mentors’ access to resources and prestige contribute to women’s attrition from independent research positions.",1

Aim
This study aimed to investigate the association between work patterns and periodontal disease.

Materials and methods
Data were collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2012, and data from 22,508 subjects aged ≥19 years were included. An individual's work pattern was classified as either daytime or shift work. Sleep duration was categorized into three ranges: ≤5, 6–8, and ≥9 h/day. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for CPI (Community Periodontal Index) ≥3. The CONTRAST statement was used to show the interaction effect of work patterns and sleep duration.

Results
The adjusted OR of shift work was 2.168 (CI: 1.929–2.438, p < .0001). Participants who sleep ≤5 or ≥9 h/day showed ORs 0.735 and 0.663, respectively (p = .0181). Interaction effect analysis revealed that the work pattern had a strong influence on periodontal condition when combined with the sleep amount. Shift workers with ≤5 or ≥ 9 h of sleep showed significantly increased ORs for CPI ≥3 (2.1406 and 2.3251, respectively, p < .0001). The ORs for daytime workers were comparable to the original values (≤5: 0.7348, p = .0292; ≥9: 0.6633, p = .0428).

Conclusion
Altered sleep patterns caused by shift work have more influence on periodontal disease than sleep duration.",1
"Background: The leading cause of death in China is stroke, a condition that also contributes heavily to the disease burden. Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common cause of stroke. Compared to Western countries, in China the proportion of ICH is significantly higher. Standardized treatment based on evidence-based medicine can help reduce ICH's burden. In the present study we aimed to explore the agreement between the management strategies during ICH's acute phase and Class I recommendations in current international practice guidelines in Beijing (China), and to elucidate the reasons underlying any inconsistencies found.

Method: We retrospectively collected in-hospital data from 1,355 ICH patients from 15 hospitals in Beijing between January and December 2012. Furthermore, a total of 75 standardized questionnaires focusing on ICH's clinical management were distributed to 15 cooperative hospitals. Each hospital randomly selected five doctors responsible for treating ICH patients to complete the questionnaires.

Results: Numerous approaches were in line with Class I recommendations, as follows: upon admission, all patients underwent radiographic examination, about 93% of the survivors received health education and 84.5% of those diagnosed with hypertension were prescribed antihypertensive treatment at discharge, in-hospital antiepileptic drugs were administered to 91.8% of the patients presenting with seizures, and continuous monitoring was performed for 88% of the patients with hyperglycemia on admission. However, several aspects were inconsistent with the guidelines, as follows: only 14.2% of the patients were initially managed in the neurological intensive care unit and 22.3% of the bedridden patients received preventive treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 48 h after onset. The questionnaire results showed that imaging examination, blood glucose monitoring, and secondary prevention of ICH were useful to more clinicians. However, the opposite occurred for the neurological intensive care unit requirement. Regarding the guidelines' recognition, no significant differences among the 3 education subgroups were observed (p > 0.05).

Conclusions: Doctors have recognized most of ICH's evidence-based practice guidelines. However, there are still large gaps between the management of ICH and the evidence-based practice guidelines in Beijing (China). Retraining doctors is required, including focusing on preventing DVT providing a value from the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Glasgow Coma Scalescores at the time of admission.

"Abstract
Objective. To assess if body mass index (BMI) and high waist circumference (HWC) are associated with testing positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods. 9,386 UK Biobank study participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16th 2020 to June 29th 2020 were analyzed. A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction between age and HWC. Results. Approximately 17% (n = 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17). For participants ≥65 years, only obesity class II (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10–1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight. While HWC was not associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in those <65 years, having an HWC was associated with an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in participants ≥65 years (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.27). Conclusion. The associations of BMI and HWC with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 differed by age. Notably, HWC was associated with testing positive in those ≥65 years, but not those who were younger, independent of BMI. This suggests that measures of adiposity in addition to BMI may be used to identify older individuals at greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.",1

Abstract
Significance Statement 
Iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are currently recommended for treating anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD. However, safety concerns with ESAs have encouraged the development of alternative treatments for anemia. The phase 3 ROCKIES study is an international study of roxadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, compared with epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia of DD-CKD. Roxadustat was noninferior to epoetin alfa in increasing hemoglobin and reducing red blood cell transfusion, and reduced intravenous iron supplementation. Roxadustat was generally well tolerated and had an adverse event profile comparable to epoetin alfa. These results indicate that oral roxadustat is an effective alternative to parenteral ESA for the management of anemia in patients with DD-CKD.

Background 
Concerns regarding cardiovascular safety with current treatments for anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD have encouraged the development of alternatives. Roxadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, stimulates erythropoiesis by increasing endogenous erythropoietin and iron availability.

Methods 
In this open-label phase 3 study, patients with DD-CKD and anemia were randomized 1:1 to oral roxadustat three times weekly or parenteral epoetin alfa per local clinic practice. Initial roxadustat dose depended on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose at screening for patients already on them and was weight-based for those not on them. The primary efficacy end point was mean hemoglobin change from baseline averaged over weeks 28‒52 for roxadustat versus epoetin alfa, regardless of rescue therapy use, tested for noninferiority (margin, −0.75 g/dl). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed.

Results 
Among 2133 patients randomized (n=1068 roxadustat, n=1065 epoetin alfa), mean age was 54.0 years, and 89.1% and 10.8% were on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively. Mean (95% confidence interval) hemoglobin change from baseline was 0.77 (0.69 to 0.85) g/dl with roxadustat and 0.68 (0.60 to 0.76) g/dl with epoetin alfa, demonstrating noninferiority (least squares mean difference [95% CI], 0.09 [0.01 to 0.18]; P<0.001). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥1 AE and ≥1 serious AE was 85.0% and 57.6% with roxadustat and 84.5% and 57.5% with epoetin alfa, respectively.

Conclusions 
Roxadustat effectively increased hemoglobin in patients with DD-CKD, with an AE profile comparable to epoetin alfa.

We contacted 9515 participants from a population-based cohort study in Catalonia between May and October 2020. We drew blood samples to establish infection to the virus. Pre-pandemic mental health conditions were confirmed through Electronic Health Registries. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess severe depression and anxiety post-pandemic. Exposure to proximal, financial and wider environment stressors during the lockdown were collected. We calculated Relative Risks (RR), adjusting for individual- and contextual covariates.

Results
Pre-pandemic mental health disorders were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection , but were associated with severity of COVID-19 disease. People with pre-existing mental health disorders showed higher prevalence of severe depression (25.4%) and anxiety (37.8%) than those without prior mental disorders (4.9% and 10.1%). Living alone was a strong predictor of severe depression among mental health patients (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.2). Among those without prior mental health disorders, post-lockdown depression and anxiety were associated with household interpersonal conflicts (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 2.1–3.1; RR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.9–2.4) and financial instability (RR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.8–2.9; 1.9, 95% CI 1.6–2.2).

Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown were associated with increased post-lockdown depression and anxiety. Patients with pre-existing mental health conditions are a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19 disease.",1
"Abstract
The long non‑coding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has important roles in the regulation of multiple cell functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis and migration. However, the mechanism by which NEAT1 regulates breast cancer progression is not well elucidated. In the present study, NEAT1 and microRNA‑124 (miR‑124) levels were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. STAT3 protein levels were detected by western blot analysis. Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were determined using MTT and colony formation assays, and flow cytometry, respectively. The results demonstrated that NEAT1 and STAT3 expression levels were increased in breast cancer tissues compared with normal breast tissues, whereas miR‑124 expression was significantly decreased. Functional analyses revealed that NEAT1 promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells. Additionally, NEAT1 and STAT3 expression levels were negatively correlated with miR‑124 levels in breast cancer tissues. A direct interaction between miR‑124, and NEAT1 and STAT3, was predicted by bioinformatics analysis and confirmed using a luciferase activity assay. NEAT1 overexpression markedly increased STAT3 protein expression levels, and this effect was reversed by miR‑124 overexpression in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, miR‑124 overexpression partially attenuated the effects of NEAT1 on breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. The inhibitory effects of miR‑124 overexpression on the proliferation rate and cell cycle progression were abolished by STAT3 overexpression. In turn, STAT3 silencing inhibited NEAT1 transcription in breast cancer cells. In summary, the present findings revealed that NEAT1 and STAT3 formed a feedback loop via sponging miR‑124 to promote breast cancer progression.",1

Background
The role of androgens on COVID-19 is well established. Proxalutamide is a second-generation, nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) with the highest antiandrogen potency among NSAAs and concurrent
regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and inflammatory response.
Proxalutamide has been demonstrated to be effective to prevent hospitalizations in early COVID-19 in
randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Conversely, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, preliminary results from
two different arms of an RCT (The Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV Trial) also demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality. This study aims to report the final, joint results of the two arms (North arm and South arm) of the
Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV trial of the two arms (North and South arms) combined, and to evaluate whether
COVID-19 response to proxalutamide was consistent across different regions (Northern Brazil and Southern
Brazil).
Materials and methods
Upon randomization, hospitalized COVID-19 patients received either proxalutamide 300mg/day or placebo
for 14 days, in addition to usual care, in a proxalutamide:placebo ratio of 1:1 in the North arm and 4:1 in the
South arm (ratio was modified due to preliminary report of high drug efficacy). Datasets of the South and North arms were combined, and statistical analysis was performed for the overall study population.
Proxalutamide was compared to placebo group for 14-day and 28-day recovery (discharge alive from the
hospital) and mortality rates, and overall and post-randomization hospitalization stay. Results of
proxalutamide and placebo groups were also compared between the North and South arms. Analysis was also
performed stratified by sex and baseline WHO COVID Ordinary Score.
Results
A total of 778 subjects were included (645 from the North, 317 from the proxalutamide group and 328 from
the placebo group; 133 from the South arm, 106 from the proxalutamide group and 27 from the placebo
group). Recovery rate was 121% higher in proxalutamide than placebo group at day 14 [81.1% vs 36.6%;
Recovery ratio (RecR) 2.21; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.92-2.56; p<0.0001], and 81% higher at day 28
(98.1% vs 47.6%; RecR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.61-2.03; p<0.0001). All-cause mortality rate was 80% lower in
proxalutamide than placebo group at Day 14 [8.0% vs 39.2%; Risk ratio (RR), 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29;
p<0.0001], and 78% lower at Day 28 (10.6% vs 48.2%; RR, 0.22; 95% CI 0.16-0.30). Post-randomization timeto-discharge was shorter in proxalutamide [median, 5 days; interquartile range (IQR), 3-8] than placebo
group (median, 9 days; IQR, 6-14) (p<0.0001). Results were statistically similar between North and South
arms for all measured outcomes. Males and females presented similar results in all outcomes. Patients that
did not require oxygen use (scores 3 and 4) did not present statistically significant improvement in recovery
and mortality rates, whereas scores 5 and 6 presented significant improvements in all outcomes (p<0.0001
for all).
Conclusion
Proxalutamide increased recovery rate, reduced mortality rate and shortened hospital stay in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. Results were similar between the two different arms, providing further consistency for
the efficacy of proxalutamide when used in late-stage COVID-19.",1
"OBJECTIVES
The effectiveness of delayed surgery for ventricular septal rupture (VSR) following myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with cardiogenic shock remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of delayed surgery following mechanical circulatory support for patients in cardiogenic shock after VSR.

METHODS
We reviewed 8 patients with post-MI VSR and cardiogenic shock who underwent delayed surgery at our institution between July 2015 and November 2017. Surgery was delayed until haemodynamic stabilization and improved organ ischaemia were achieved by initiating intra-aortic balloon pumping with or without veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We investigated the operative mortality, morbidity and late survival.

RESULTS
All 8 patients had preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump support, and 5 had additional veno-arterial ECMO support. Emergency repair was successfully avoided in all cases. The median time from the onset of MI to operation was 7.1 (3.7–9.9) days, and that from the diagnosis of VSR to operation was 1.9 (1.3–2.3) days. The operative mortality was 12.5%, and complications related to mechanical circulatory support occurred in 1 case (12.5%). The 2-year survival rate was 62.5%.

CONCLUSIONS
A combination of preoperative mechanical circulatory support and delayed surgery may improve the outcomes of patients with post-MI VSR, which was complicated by cardiogenic shock. The key to a better surgical outcome may be delaying the surgery for improving end-organ perfusion. This requires further investigation, especially for determining the optimal duration of support.",1
"Abstract
Objective
This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies in COVID-19 patients.

Methods
We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases until July 27, 2022. Both randomized control trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were included and analyzed separately. The outcomes included mortality, incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), ventilation improvement rate (need oxygen therapy to without oxygen therapy), secondary infection, and adverse events (AEs). The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by a random-effects meta-analysis model.

Results
Five RCTs and 2 cohort studies with 1726 COVID-19 patients were recruited (n = 866 in the GM-CSF antibody group and n = 891 in the control group). GM-CSF antibodies treatment reduced the incidence of IMV, which was supported by two cohort studies (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.03, 0.74) and three RCTs (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41, 0.94). GM-CSF antibodies resulted in slight but not significant reductions in mortality (based on two cohort studies and five RCTs) and ventilation improvement (based on one cohort study and two RCTs). The sensitive analysis further showed the results of mortality and ventilation improvement rate became statistically significant when one included study was removed. Besides, GM-CSF antibodies did not increase the risks of the second infection (based on one cohort study and five RCTs) and AEs (based on five RCTs).

Conclusion
GM-CSF antibody treatments may be an efficacious and well-tolerant way for the treatment of COVID-19. Further clinical evidence is still warranted.",1
"Abstract
Background: 
Clinical significance of chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) remains largely unknown. This study was performed to assess the expression of CLIC1 in benign and malignant pancreatic lesions, and to assess its clinicopathological significance.

Materials and Methods: 
Tissue samples from resected PDAC (n = 70) and their matched normal pairs were evaluated for CLIC1 expression by immunohistochemical staining. Their expression was correlated with different clinicopathological parameters.

Results: 
CLIC1 expression was significantly higher (67.1%) in PDAC than in adjacent control tissues (25.7%, P < 0.001). High CLIC1 levels were associated with the histological grade (P < 0.001) and tumor size (P < 0.001); but not with sex, age, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, tumor location, or lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Univariate Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that a positive CLIC1 expression was associated with a decreased overall survival (P < 0.01). Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that CLIC1 expression and lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for disease-free survival.

Conclusion: 
The expression of CLIC1 might be closely related to the carcinogenesis, clinical biological behaviors, and prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.",1
"Abstract
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Although much is understood concerning the pathology of PCOS, further investigation into the influence of microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) on the proliferation of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) is needed. This study investigated the role of specific miRNAs in ovarian dysfunction of PCOS and its effect on the proliferation of GCs. Initially, miRNA profiling was performed on the ovarian cortexes of 15 rats in which PCOS had been induced and 15 rats without PCOS (non-PCOS). This mechanical study was performed on ovarian GCs extracted from human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)-induced rats. Insulin was used to treat GCs to establish the PCOS cell model. Increased Equus caballus mir-9119 expression was observed and confirmed in the insulin-induced model of PCOS in GCs (GC-PCOS) as well as in the hCG-induced rats when compared to non-PCOS rats and cells. Observation and confirmation were carried out through both miRNA array and quantitative PCR. In contrast, downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) p65 was observed in the PCOS cell model. Additionally, annexin V, FITC, and propidium iodide flow cytometry showed overexpression of miR-9119-induced apoptosis. In this study, we revealed that miR-9119 inhibition regulates p65 expression levels in insulin-treated GCs by binding to the 3′-untranslated of p65. Additionally, regulation of p65 expression was positively correlated with the expression of the double-stranded RNA endoribonuclease DICER. Moreover, RNA silencing/overexpression of p65 affected the functional role of miR-9119. In conclusion, GCs of PCOS, the expression of miR-9119, and targeted NFκB/p65-DICER axis are upregulated in order to maintain cell viability and prevent apoptosis, thereby promoting Anti-Müllerian hormone production in GCs. This study may provide a new understanding of the mechanism of GC dysfunction.",1
"Abstract
Background
Mediterranean-type ecosystems are fire-prone environments where species have evolved in the presence of seasonal summer conditions and frequent fires. In these environments, many species have seeds with impermeable hard coats that impose physical seed dormancy which prevents seed germination until it is broken by any factor such as fire or high summer temperatures. Most studies have usually focused on the isolated effects of fire or summer temperatures on the release of physical seed dormancy. However, both factors frequently operate together because when a fire occurs, usually in summer, seeds in the soil suffer not only the heat shock during the fire, but also the high summer temperatures. Nevertheless, the combined effect of both factors is almost unknown. In this investigation, we studied the isolated and combined effects of heat shock and the high temperatures of summer. The main objective was to evaluate whether the timing in which seeds are exposed to a heat shock during the period of high summer temperatures affects seed germination.

Results
We exposed the seeds of 12 Cistaceae species to three different treatments, in which heat shock (100 °C for 10 min) was applied before, after, or before + after they were exposed to summer temperatures (50/20 °C for 1 month). Although fire was the main factor breaking physical dormancy, its effects were regulated by the timing when it was simulated. We found that summer temperatures following heat shock had negative effects on seed germination since a high proportion of seeds remained dormant. On the contrary, when summer temperatures preceded heat shock, physical dormancy was broken, and germination increased.

Conclusions
Timing of fire during summer plays an important role in controlling seed germination of Cistaceae. Our results provide a novel explanation for the higher Cistaceae seedling emergence found in the field after late season fires. Additionally, we can carefully draw conclusions for fire management since prescribed burnings would have different effects depending on when they were carried out.",1

Background: Resolvin D1 (RvD1), a pro-resolution lipid mediator derived from docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA), has been described to promote several kinds of inflammatory resolution. However, the effects and
anti-inflammatory mechanisms of RvD1 on psoriasis have not been previously reported.
Objective: The present study aimed to determine the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of
RvD1 on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasiform dermatitis.
Methods: Mice were topically treated with IMQ to develop psoriasiform dermatitis on their shaved back,
pretreated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with or without RvD1 or tert-butoxycarbonyl Met-Leu-Phe peptide
(Boc), a lipoxin A4 (ALX) receptor antagonist. The severity was monitored and graded using a modified
human scoring system, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), histopathology, and the signature
cytokines of psoriasis (IL-23, IL-17, IL-22 and TNF-a). The mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory
cytokines were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) and ELISA. The expressions of
signaling proteins MAPKs and NF-kB p65 were analyzed using western blotting. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA) was used to check NF-kB p65 DNA binding activity.
Results: Our study showed that RvD1 alleviated IMQ-induced psoriasiform dermatitis and improved skin
pathological changes. RvD1 markedly inhibited IMQ-induced activation of ERK1/2, p38, JNK (c-Jun Nterminal protein kinase, a subfamily of MAPKs), and NF-kB. Furthermore, pretreatment with Boc, would
not exacerbate skin inflammation of IMQ-induced mice, but significantly reversed the beneficial effects
of RvD1 on IMQ-induced psoriasiform inflammation.
Conclusion: RvD1 can obviously improve skin inflammation in IMQ-induced mice psoriasiform
dermatitis. The protective mechanisms might be related to its selective reaction with lipoxin A4
receptor/Formyl-peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2), by downregulating relevant cytokines of the IL-23/IL-17
axis expression, the inhibition of MAPKs and NF-kB signaling transduction pathways. Thus, these results
show that RvD1 could be a possible candidate for psoriasis therapy.

"Abstract
Background: Examination of maternal experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and depression as risk
factors for food insecurity can provide a more nuanced understanding of the role that the family environment
and women’s health plays in the lives of families with young children that experience food insecurity. We
investigated the longitudinal association between mothers’ experiences of IPV and household food insecurity,
and whether maternal depression mediated the relationship.
Methods: IPV, depression, and food insecurity were assessed among 1,690 socioeconomically disadvantaged
mothers of young children who participated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. Longitudinal
multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between IPV measured 3 years after
the child’s birth and increase in food insecurity from child’s third to fifth birthday, as well as the mediating role
of maternal depression, controlling for a number of maternal and household characteristics.
Results: Mothers who reside in food insecure households and those who experience IPV share similar characteristics of socioeconomic disadvantage and a greater propensity for depression compared to their counterparts.
Mothers’ experiences of IPV predicted an increased risk of household food insecurity two years later, and the
relationship was mediated by maternal depression.
Conclusions: Food insecure mothers may benefit from widespread assistance. Targeting issues central to
women’s health must become a priority in combating food insecurity. Having IPV and mental health screenings
coincide with food assistance applications may help identify women who would benefit from resources designed
to increase physical safety, psychological well-being, and food security.",1
"Abstract
Colon cancer (CC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Emodin is an anthraquinone-active substance that has the ability to affect tumor progression. Our study aims to explore the effects and the relevant mechanism of emodin on the invasion and migration of CC in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we found that emodin inhibited the invasion and migration abilities of RKO cells and decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a dose-dependent manner. Further research suggested that emodin inhibited EMT by increasing the mRNA level of E-cadherin and decreasing the expression of N-cadherin, Snail, and β-catenin. Emodin also significantly inhibited the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by downregulating the expression of related downstream target genes, including TCF4, cyclin D1, and c-Myc. A Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway agonist abolished the effect of emodin on EMT and cell mobility, suggesting that emodin exerted its regulating role through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The CC xenograft model was established to study the antitumor efficiency of emodin in vivo. The in vivo study further demonstrated that emodin (40 mg/kg) suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting EMT via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in vivo. Taken together, we suggest that emodin inhibits the invasion and migration of CC cells in vitro and in vivo by blocking EMT, which is related with the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

"SUMMARY
Purpose To analyse the available data on the effectiveness and safety of ritodrine hydrochloride in delaying delivery and in
decreasing the incidence of preterm birth.
Methods Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness and safety of ritodrine
hydrochloride with a placebo or with no treatment. Main outcome measures were relative risks (RRs) for perinatal mortality,
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), delivery within 48 hours or 7 days, preterm birth before 37 weeks gestation
and low birth weight. We searched computerised databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Ichushi Web) from their inception to
October 2004, and searched the references of eligible trials.
Results Seventeen RCTs were included and meta-analysis was conducted. Pooled RRs relative to placebo for delivery
within 48 hours or 7 days for parenteral ritodrine hydrochloride were 0.74 (95%CI (confidential interval): 0.56, 0.97), 0.85
(95%CI: 0.74, 0.97). There was no significant decrease in perinatal mortality, the proportion of RDS, preterm birth and low
birth weight infants. Maternal side-effects significantly increased in patients receiving ritodrine with respect to those
receiving a placebo. Pooled RRs relative to placebo for oral ritodrine hydrochloride showed no significant decrease in
primary and secondary endpoints.
Conclusions The effectiveness of parenteral ritodrine hydrochloride for tocolysis in preterm labour is limited to shortrange prolongation of gestation. The effectiveness of maintenance tocolytic therapy with oral ritodrine hydrochloride was not
proved. Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1
"Abstract Introduction: Post-stroke depressive symptoms (PSDS) are common and relevant for patient outcome, but their complex pathophysiology is ill understood. It likely involves social, psychological and biological factors. Lesion location is a readily available information in stroke patients, but it is unclear if the neurobiological substrates of PSDS are spatially localized. Building on previous analyses, we sought to determine if PSDS are associated with specific lesion locations, structural disconnection and/or localized functional diaschisis.

Methods: In a prospective observational study, we examined 270 patients with first-ever stroke with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) around 6 months post-stroke. Based on individual lesion locations and the depression subscale of the HADS we performed support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping, structural-disconnection-symptom mapping and functional lesion network-symptom-mapping, in a reanalysis of this previously published cohort to infer structure–function relationships.

Results: We found that depressive symptoms were associated with (i) lesions in the right insula, right putamen, inferior frontal gyrus and right amygdala and (ii) structural disconnection in the right temporal lobe. In contrast, we found no association with localized functional diaschisis. In addition, we were unable to confirm a previously described association between depressive symptom load and a network damage score derived from functional disconnection maps.

Discussion: Based on our results, and other recent lesion studies, we see growing evidence for a prominent role of right frontostriatal brain circuits in PSDS.",1
"ABSTRACT
The family Anelloviridae comprises torque teno viruses (TTVs) diverse in genome structure and organization. The isolation of a large number of TTV genomes (TTV Heidelberg [TTV-HD]) of 26 TTV types is reported. Several isolates from the same type indicate sequence variation within open reading frame 1 (ORF1), resulting in considerably modified open reading frames. We demonstrate in vitro replication of 12 full-length genomes of TTV-HD in 293TT cells. Propagation of virus was achieved by several rounds of infections using supernatant and frozen whole cells of initially infected cells. Replication of virus was measured by PCR amplification and transcription analyses. Subgenomic molecules (μTTV), arising early during propagation and ranging in size from 401 to 913 bases, were cloned and characterized. Propagation of these μTTV in in vitro cultures was demonstrated in the absence of full-length genomes.",1
"Abstract
Background
Emerging adulthood is a critical neurodevelopment period in which extreme drinking has a potentially pronounced neurotoxic effect. Therefore, extreme drinking, even a single episode, could be particularly harmful to the developing brain’s structure. Relatedly, heavy alcohol use in emerging adults has been associated with structural brain damage, especially in the corpus callosum. However, it is unclear whether and how much a single extreme drinking episode would affect brain morphometry.

Methods
For the first time in the literature, the current study prospectively examined the impact of an extreme drinking episode (i.e., twenty-first birthday celebration) on the brain morphometry of emerging adults immediately following their birthday celebration (n = 50) and approximately 5 weeks post–birthday celebration (n = 29).

Results
We found evidence that a single extreme drinking episode was associated with structural changes immediately post–birthday celebration. Specifically, higher twenty-first birthday estimated blood-alcohol concentration was associated with decreased volume of the posterior and central corpus callosum immediately post–birthday celebration. This extreme drinking episode was not associated with further structural changes, or recovery, 5 weeks post–twenty-first birthday celebration.

Conclusions
Overall, results suggest that a single episode of heavy drinking in emerging adulthood may be associated with immediate structural changes of the corpus callosum. Thus, emerging adulthood, which is characterized by high rates of extreme drinking, could be a critical period for targeted prevention and intervention.",1

Objective
This study aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in treating minimum hepatic encephalopathy (MHE).

Methods
A systematic search was conducted across three major databases: PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang. The search period spanned from the inception of each database to 9 March 2023. The objective was to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of probiotic preparations in treating MHE. The search terms included ‘probiotics’ along with other clinically relevant terms to comprehensively capture all pertinent studies.

Results
A total of 18 RCTs were included. The meta-analysis showed that probiotic treatment outperformed control groups in reducing blood ammonia levels (standard mean difference [MD] = −2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −3.90 to −1.46, p < .0001), improving the remission rate of MHE (risk ratio [RR] = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.23–6.35, p = .01) and lowering alanine aminotransferase levels (MD = −11.10, 95% CI: −16.17 to −6.03, p < .0001). It also significantly reduced the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores (MD = −2.55, 95% CI: −3.56 to −1.54, p < .00001) and the incidence of MHE (RR = .18, 95% CI: .09–.34, p < .00001).

Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that probiotics effectively improve blood ammonia levels, liver function and cognitive function in patients with MHE. They significantly enhance the remission rate of MHE and effectively reduce its incidence, providing solid new evidence for treating MHE with probiotics.",1
"Summary
Several molecular epidemiological studies have been conducted to examine the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and male infertility susceptibility, but the results remain inconsistent. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 10 case–control studies, including 2275 cases and 1958 controls, were selected. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the strength of association in the additive model, dominant model and recessive model. In the overall analysis, no significant association between the polymorphism and risk of male infertility was observed. Stratified analysis showed that significantly strong association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and male infertility were present only in Asians (OR = 1.79 for TT vs. CC genotype; OR = 1.42 for CT/TT vs. CC genotype; OR = 1.50 for TT vs. CC/CT genotype; OR = 1.36 for T vs. C allele), but not in Caucasians. Additionally, MTHFR 677T was associated with a significant increase in the risk of azoospermia in all genetic models. No significantly increased risks of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia were found in any of the genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis supports that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is capable of causing male infertility susceptibility in Asians, but not in Caucasians.",1
"Klonsky and May (2014) argued that an “ideation-to-action” framework should
guide suicide theory, research, and prevention. From this perspective, (a) the development of suicide ideation and (b) the progression from ideation to suicide
attempts are distinct processes with distinct explanations. The present article introduces a specific theory of suicide rooted in the ideation-to-action framework:
the Three-Step Theory (3ST). First, the theory hypothesizes that suicide ideation
results from the combination of pain (usually psychological pain) and hopelessness.
Second, among those experiencing both pain and hopelessness, connectedness is a
key protective factor against escalating ideation. Third, the theory views the progression from ideation to attempts as facilitated by dispositional, acquired, and
practical contributors to the capacity to attempt suicide. To examine the theory, the
authors administered self-report measures to 910 U.S. adults utilizing Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk (oversampling for ideation and attempt histories). Results supported the theory’s central tenets. First, an interactive model of pain and hopelessness accounted for substantial variance in suicide ideation. This result replicated
in both men and women, and across age groups (i.e., 18–25, 26–35, and 36–70).
Also as predicted, connectedness was most protective against ideation in those high
on both pain and hopelessness. Finally, dispositional, acquired, and practical aspects
of suicide capacity each predicted suicide attempt history over and above current
and lifetime suicidal ideation. These initial findings support the 3ST. Implications
for suicide prevention and future research are discussed.

"ABSTRACT
Long non-coding RNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) has been probed in cerebral ischemia, while the
regulatory mechanism of ZFAS1 in focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) via binding to microRNA (miR)-144-5p
remains rarely explored. This study aims to decipher the function of ZFAS1 on FCI via sponging miR144-5p to modulate fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7). The focal cerebral ischemia rat model was
established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) Lentivirus vectors altering ZFAS1, miR144-5p or FGF7 expression were injected into rats before MCAO. Then, ZFAS1, miR-144-5p, and FGF7
levels were detected, the inflammatory factor level, oxidative stress level, angiogenesis, neurological
function injury and neuronal apoptosis were assessed. The binding relations among ZFAS1, miR-144-
5p and FGF7 were validated. ZFAS1 and FGF7 expression was elevated, while miR-144-5p expression
was reduced in FCI rats. Decreased ZFAS1 or FGF7 or enriched miR-144-5p repressed the inflammatory
response, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, while it improved angiogenesis, and neurological
function recovery; while up-regulated ZFAS1 exerted opposite effects. The augmented miR-144-5p
or silenced FGF7 reversed the effects of enriched ZFAS1. ZFAS1 sponged miR-144-5p that targeted
FGF7. Inhibition of lncRNA ZFAS1 improves functional recovery and angiogenesis after FCI via miR144-5p/FGF7 axis. This study provides novel therapeutic targets for FCI treatment",1

Background
Randomized trials have shown that vitamin C shortens the duration of common colds. Some trials reported greater effects on severe cold symptoms compared with mild symptoms. This review systematically compares the effects of vitamin C on severe and mild common cold symptoms.

Methods
We included all placebo-controlled trials of orally administered vitamin C in doses of at least 1 g/day for the common cold for people in good health at baseline. The analysis was restricted to trials which reported both the total duration of the common cold, and the severity of the common cold measured using severity scales, the duration of more severe stages of the cold, or proxies for severe colds such as days indoors. Findings were pooled using the inverse variance, fixed effect options of the metacont function of the R package meta to calculate the ratio of means estimate.

Results
Fifteen comparisons from 10 trials which reported both mild and severe symptoms were identified. All trials were randomized and double-blind. Compared to placebo, vitamin C significantly decreased the severity of the common cold by 15% (95% CI 9–21%). The direct comparison of the effect of vitamin C on mild and severe symptoms was limited to five comparisons which found that vitamin C had a significant benefit on the duration of severe symptoms. In this subset, there was a significant difference in the size of the effect of vitamin C on the overall duration of colds versus the duration of severe colds (P = 0.002), and vitamin C had no significant effect on the duration of mild symptoms.

Conclusions
The common cold is the leading cause of acute morbidity and a major cause of absenteeism from work and school. However, absenteeism is dependent on the severity of symptoms. The finding that vitamin C may have a greater effect on more severe measures of the common cold is therefore important. Further research on the therapeutic effects of vitamin C on the common cold should measure outcomes of differing levels of severity.",1
"Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor lacking sensitive biomarkers for prognosis.
Sox3, a member of the Sex determining region Y box gene superfamily, has been demonstrated to be an oncogene
in many cancers. However, the expression and clinical importance of Sox3 in HCC remains elusive. In this study, fifty
pairs of HCC tissues with adjacent non-tumor samples were collected for detecting Sox3 expression by qPCR and
immunoblotting analyses. A total of 104 HCC tissues were included for immunohistochemistry assay and analyzed
by immunostaining scores. The correlation of Sox3 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of
HCC patients were calculated. Sox3 expression in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the non-tumor
counterparts at the mRNA and protein levels. High staining scores of Sox3 was detected in 75.96% of HCC tissues.
Statistical analyses demonstrated that highly expressed Sox3 was significantly correlated with low tumor capsule
formation, advanced tumor stage and poor tumor differentiation. Moreover, patients with high Sox3 expression
showed worse recurrence-free survival and overall survival than those with low Sox3 expression, and multivariate
analyses further indicated that status of Sox3 expression is an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients.
Therefore, our results suggested that overexpression of Sox3 in HCC tissues is correlated with increased tumor
development and poor prognosis in HCC.",1
"While the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved survival, tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death in the HIV-infected population. We used Mycobacterium tuberculosis/simian immunodeficiency virus–coinfected (M. tuberculosis/SIV–coinfected) macaques to model M. tuberculosis/HIV coinfection and study the impact of ART on TB reactivation due to HIV infection. Although ART significantly reduced viral loads and increased CD4+ T cell counts in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, it did not reduce the relative risk of SIV-induced TB reactivation in ART-treated macaques in the early phase of treatment. CD4+ T cells were poorly restored specifically in the lung interstitium, despite their significant restoration in the alveolar compartment of the lung as well as in the periphery. IDO1 induction in myeloid cells in the inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) likely contributed to dysregulated T cell homing and impaired lung immunity. Thus, although ART was indispensable for controlling viral replication, restoring CD4+ T cells, and preventing opportunistic infection, it appeared inadequate in reversing the clinical signs of TB reactivation during the relatively short duration of ART administered in this study. This finding warrants the modeling of concurrent treatment of TB and HIV to potentially reduce the risk of reactivation of TB due to HIV to inform treatment strategies in patients with M. tuberculosis/HIV coinfection.",1
"Abstract
Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx-NiO composites with three-dimensional (3D) porous networks were successfully fabricated via vacuum freeze-drying. The microstructure, absorption, and electrochemical properties of the developed composites were investigated. Nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles could be evenly distributed on the three-dimensional network of three-dimensional Ti3C2Tx using solution processing. When employed as electrochemical capacitor electrodes in 1 M environmentally friendly sodium sulfate, Na2SO4, solution, the three-dimensional porous Ti3C2Tx-NiO composite electrodes exhibited considerable volume specific capacitance as compared to three-dimensional porous Ti3C2Tx. The three-dimensional porous Ti3C2Tx-NiO composite delivered a remarkable cycling performance with a capacitance retention of up to 114% over 2500 cycles. The growth trend of the capacitance with NiO content shows that nickel oxide plays a crucial role in the composite electrodes. These results present a roadmap for the development of convenient and economical supercapacitors in consideration with the possibilities of morphological control and the extensibility of the process.

"Abstract
This study aims to investigate the mechanism of tumor-derived exosomal (EVs) SNHG16 in promoting the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of SNHG16, miR-23b-5p and MCM6 in NPC. MTT, flow cytometry and transwell were used to detect the effects of them on the proliferation, cycle, apoptosis and invasion ability of NPC. Transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting and BCA were used to verify the regulation of exosome secretion under different oxygen environments. Our results showed that hypoxia induces tumor-derived exosome SNHG16 to mediate NPC progression through the miR-23b-5p/MCM6 pathway.",1
"Abstract
Background: Transcutaneous exposure to food allergens can lead to food sensitization (FS)/food allergy (FA). We measured skin barrier function in early infancy and related it to the later development of FS/FA at age 2 years.

Objective: We sought to examine the relationship between early life skin barrier function and FA in infancy.

Methods: Infants in the Babies After Scope: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact Using Neurological and Nutritional Endpoints (BASELINE) birth cohort had transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measured in the early newborn period and at 2 and 6 months of age. At age 2 years, infants had FS/FA screening with skin prick tests and oral food challenges.

Results: One thousand nine hundred three infants were enrolled. One thousand three hundred fifty-five were retained to age 2 years, and 1260 underwent FS screening. FS was present in 6.27% (79/1260; 95% CI, 4.93% to 7.61%), and FA prevalence was 4.45% (56/1258; 95% CI, 3.38% to 5.74%). Egg was the most prevalent allergen (2.94%), followed by peanut (1.75%) and cow's milk (0.74%). Day 2 upper-quartile TEWL (>9 g water/m(2)/h) was a significant predictor of FA at age 2 years (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% CI, 1.5-4.8). Seventy-five percent of children with FA at 2 years of age had day 2 TEWL in the upper quartile. Even in those without atopic dermatitis (AD), infants with upper-quartile day 2 TEWL were 3.5 times more likely to have FA at 2 years than infants in the lowest quartile (95% CI, 1.3-11.1; P = .04).

Conclusion: Neonatal skin barrier dysfunction predicts FA at 2 years of age, supporting the concept of transcutaneous allergen sensitization, even in infants who do not have AD. TEWL could be used for stratifying infants in the first few days of life before development of AD or FA for targeted intervention studies to potentially alter the atopic march.

AIM
To examine the role of microRNA 1181 (miR-1181) in invasion and proliferation in pancreatic cancer.

METHODS
We analyzed the expression of miR-1181 in several pancreatic cancer cell lines and generated stable MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines with up-regulated miR-1181 expression using an adenovirus delivery system. We then investigated miR-1181's effect on invasion and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells by transwell assay, wound healing assay, cell counting kit-8 assay and colony-forming assay, and explored any underlying mechanisms by western bolt. Beyond that, we observed the change of the PANC-1 cell's cytoskeleton by immunofluorescence staining.

RESULTS
Our data showed that miR-1181 was relatively down-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. And miR-1181 inhibited the migration, invasion and proliferation activities of MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Notably, after over-expressing of miR-1181 in PANC-1 cells, F-actin depolymerized. Immunofluorescence staining shows decreased F-actin and β-tubulin expression in PANC-1 cells over-expressing miR-1181 compared with the control cells. Furthermore, we found that over-expressing miR-1181 inhibited the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) while knocking-down miR-1181 up-regulated the expression of STAT3. Knocking-down miR-1181 promoted the invasion and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. And inhibition of STAT3 blocked the promotion effects of knocking-down miR-1181 on proliferation and invasion in pancreatic cancer.

CONCLUSION
Together our findings suggest that miR-1181 may be involved in pancreatic cancer cell invasion and proliferation by targeting STAT3 and indicate that miR-1181 may be a potential therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer.

"Abstract
Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is believed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides or exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence was more common at the seedling stage. Only 30% of studies showed significant conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence. Among those studies, applying fungicides significantly reduced the effect of conspecific negative distance-dependent mortality. Excluding large mammals reduced the effect of conspecifics, but with only marginal significance (p < 0.1). Our study confirms that plant pathogens have a significant impact on distance-dependent mortality and suggests that the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, appear to weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types, and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.",1
"Task differentiation in cooperative groups can arise through a wide range of mechanisms. A recent hypothesis, supported by empirical studies of social spiders, suggests that a variation in individual personalities might be one such mechanism. Personality-based task differentiation can either arise as an
emergent property of group living based on inherent behavioural variation among individuals, or
alternatively it could be an adaptation to permanent sociality favoured by individual fitness benefits
arising from increased group efficiency and productivity. We tested whether personality-based task
differentiation is present in the temporarily social spider Stegodyphus tentoriicola which represents the
ancestral state from which permanent sociality in spiders has evolved. This species is closely related to
the permanently social Stegodyphus sarasinorum in which personality-based task differentiation has been
documented. We measured individual boldness and investigated individual participation in simulated
prey capture events twice per day on 5 consecutive days. We found no evidence for personality-based
task differentiation: S. tentoriicola spiders did not exhibit consistent personalities in boldness or
consistent task differentiation in prey attack. Our results lend support for the hypothesis that
personality-based task differentiation is an adaptation to permanently social living in spiders as their
ancestral representative lacks this trait.

"Abstract
Background
The objective of this review was to assess the quality and strength of the evidence provided by human observational studies for a causal association between exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and risk of the most investigated neoplastic diseases.
Methods
Eligibility criteria: We included cohort and case-control studies of neoplasia risks in relation to three types of exposure to RF-EMF: near-field, head-localized, exposure from wireless phone use (SR-A); far-field, whole body, environmental exposure from fixed-site transmitters (SR-B); near/far-field occupational exposures from use of hand-held transceivers or RF-emitting equipment in the workplace (SR-C). While no restrictions on tumour type were applied, in the current paper we focus on incidence-based studies of selected “critical” neoplasms of the central nervous system (brain, meninges, pituitary gland, acoustic nerve) and salivary gland tumours (SR-A); brain tumours and leukaemias (SR-B, SR-C). We focussed on investigations of specific neoplasms in relation to specific exposure sources (i.e. E-O pairs), noting that a single article may address multiple E-O pairs.
Information sources: Eligible studies were identified by literature searches through Medline, Embase, and EMF-Portal.
Risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment: We used a tailored version of the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) RoB tool to evaluate each study’s internal validity. At the summary RoB step, studies were classified into three tiers according to their overall potential for bias (low, moderate and high).
Data synthesis: We synthesized the study results using random effects restricted maximum likelihood (REML) models (overall and subgroup meta-analyses of dichotomous and categorical exposure variables), and weighted mixed effects models (dose–response meta-analyses of lifetime exposure intensity).
Evidence assessment: Confidence in evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.
Results
We included 63 aetiological articles, published between 1994 and 2022, with participants from 22 countries, reporting on 119 different E-O pairs. RF-EMF exposure from mobile phones (ever or regular use vs no or non-regular use) was not associated with an increased risk of glioma [meta-estimate of the relative risk (mRR) = 1.01, 95 % CI = 0.89–1.13), meningioma (mRR = 0.92, 95 % CI = 0.82–1.02), acoustic neuroma (mRR = 1.03, 95 % CI = 0.85–1.24), pituitary tumours (mRR = 0.81, 95 % CI = 0.61–1.06), salivary gland tumours (mRR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.78–1.06), or paediatric (children, adolescents and young adults) brain tumours (mRR = 1.06, 95 % CI = 0.74–1.51), with variable degree of across-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0 %-62 %). There was no observable increase in mRRs for the most investigated neoplasms (glioma, meningioma, and acoustic neuroma) with increasing time since start (TSS) use of mobile phones, cumulative call time (CCT), or cumulative number of calls (CNC). Cordless phone use was not significantly associated with risks of glioma [mRR = 1.04, 95 % CI = 0.74–1.46; I2 = 74 %) meningioma, (mRR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.70–1.18; I2 = 59 %), or acoustic neuroma (mRR = 1.16; 95 % CI = 0.83–1.61; I2 = 63 %). Exposure from fixed-site transmitters (broadcasting antennas or base stations) was not associated with childhood leukaemia or paediatric brain tumour risks, independently of the level of the modelled RF exposure. Glioma risk was not significantly increased following occupational RF exposure (ever vs never), and no differences were detected between increasing categories of modelled cumulative exposure levels.
Discussion
In the sensitivity analyses of glioma, meningioma, and acoustic neuroma risks in relation to mobile phone use (ever use, TSS, CCT, and CNC) the presented results were robust and not affected by changes in study aggregation.
In a leave-one-out meta-analyses of glioma risk in relation to mobile phone use we identified one influential study. In subsequent meta-analyses performed after excluding this study, we observed a substantial reduction in the mRR and the heterogeneity between studies, for both the contrast Ever vs Never (regular) use (mRR = 0.96, 95 % CI = 0.87–1.07, I2 = 47 %), and in the analysis by increasing categories of TSS (“<5 years”: mRR = 0.97, 95 % CI = 0.83–1.14, I2 = 41 %; “5-9 years ”: mRR = 0.96, 95 % CI = 0.83–1.11, I2 = 34 %; “10+ years”: mRR = 0.97, 95 % CI = 0.87–1.08, I2 = 10 %).
There was limited variation across studies in RoB for the priority domains (selection/attrition, exposure and outcome information), with the number of studies evenly classified as at low and moderate risk of bias (49 % tier-1 and 51 % tier-2), and no studies classified as at high risk of bias (tier-3). The impact of the biases on the study results (amount and direction) proved difficult to predict, and the RoB tool was inherently unable to account for the effect of competing biases. However, the sensitivity meta-analyses stratified on bias-tier, showed that the heterogeneity observed in our main meta-analyses across studies of glioma and acoustic neuroma in the upper TSS stratum (I2 = 77 % and 76 %), was explained by the summary RoB-tier. In the tier-1 study subgroup, the mRRs (95 % CI; I2) in long-term (10+ years) users were 0.95 (0.85–1.05; 5.5 %) for glioma, and 1.00 (0.78–1.29; 35 %) for acoustic neuroma.
The time-trend simulation studies, evaluated as complementary evidence in line with a triangulation approach for external validity, were consistent in showing that the increased risks observed in some case-control studies were incompatible with the actual incidence rates of glioma/brain cancer observed in several countries and over long periods. Three of these simulation studies consistently reported that RR estimates > 1.5 with a 10+ years induction period were definitely implausible, and could be used to set a “credibility benchmark”. In the sensitivity meta-analyses of glioma risk in the upper category of TSS excluding five studies reporting implausible effect sizes, we observed strong reductions in both the mRR [mRR of 0.95 (95 % CI = 0.86–1.05)], and the degree of heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 3.6 %).
Conclusions
Consistently with the published protocol, our final conclusions were formulated separately for each exposure-outcome combination, and primarily based on the line of evidence with the highest confidence, taking into account the ranking of RF sources by exposure level as inferred from dosimetric studies, and the external coherence with findings from time-trend simulation studies (limited to glioma in relation to mobile phone use).
For near field RF-EMF exposure to the head from mobile phone use, there was moderate certainty evidence that it likely does not increase the risk of glioma, meningioma, acoustic neuroma, pituitary tumours, and salivary gland tumours in adults, or of paediatric brain tumours.
For near field RF-EMF exposure to the head from cordless phone use, there was low certainty evidence that it may not increase the risk of glioma, meningioma or acoustic neuroma.
For whole-body far-field RF-EMF exposure from fixed-site transmitters (broadcasting antennas or base stations), there was moderate certainty evidence that it likely does not increase childhood leukaemia risk and low certainty evidence that it may not increase the risk of paediatric brain tumours. There were no studies eligible for inclusion investigating RF-EMF exposure from fixed-site transmitters and critical tumours in adults.
For occupational RF-EMF exposure, there was low certainty evidence that it may not increase the risk of brain cancer/glioma, but there were no included studies of leukemias (the second critical outcome in SR-C).
The evidence rating regarding paediatric brain tumours in relation to environmental RF exposure from fixed-site transmitters should be interpreted with caution, due to the small number of studies. Similar interpretative cautions apply to the evidence rating of the relation between glioma/brain cancer and occupational RF exposure, due to differences in exposure sources and metrics across the few included studies.",1
"Abstract
Introduction. Malpositioning of the implant results in polyethylene wear and loosing of implant after total knee arthroplasty. Scanogram is often used for measurement of limb alignment. Computer navigation provides real time measurements and thus, the aim is to see any association pre- and postoperatively between coronal alignments measured on scanogram to computer navigation during total knee arthroplasty. Material and Methods. We prospectively gathered data of 200 patients with advanced degenerative symptomatic arthritis, who were consecutively selected for primary total knee arthroplasty with computer navigation. Every patient’s pre- and postoperative scanogram were compared to the intraoperative computer navigation findings. Results. The results show that the preoperative mean mechanical axis on navigation was 10.65° (SD ± 6.95) and on scanogram it was 10.38° (SD ± 6.89). On the other hand, the mean postoperative mechanical axis on navigation was 0.69° (SD ± 0.87) and on scanogram it was 2.73° (SD ± 2.10). Preoperatively, there was no significant difference (p value = 0.46) between the two. However, the postoperative outcomes suggest that there was a noteworthy difference, with no correlation between the mean Hip-Knee Ankle Axis (HKA) and intraoperative mechanical axis (p value <0.0001). Conclusion. Postoperative mechanical alignment values after total knee arthroplasty are lower on navigation than measured on standing full length hip to ankle scanogram.",1
"Abstract
Picroside II is an important ingredient agent in Traditional Chinese medicine and hoped to reduce hepatocellular injury caused by severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). An SAP-induced hepatocellular injury model was established in rats by using pentobarbital sodium. 27 rats were divided into 3 groups: the sham group (SG), model group (MG), and Picroside groups (PG). SAP-induced hepatocellular injury was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. We measured hepatocellular enzymes (amylase (AMY), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), oxidative stress factors (superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin- (IL-) 6, and IL-10), apoptotic factors (BAX and cleaved caspase 3), and inflammatory signaling (Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), p-JAK2, and p-STAT3) in hepatocellular tissues. The SAP-induced hepatocellular injury model was successfully established. Picroside II treatment repaired hepatocellular injury by reducing the activities of AMY, ALT, and AST; reducing the levels of MDA, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, p-JAK2, p-STAT3, BAX, and cleaved caspase 3; and increasing the levels of SOD and IL-10. Picroside II exerted protective function for the SAP-induced hepatocellular injury model. Picroside II improved SAP-induced hepatocellular injury and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by affecting JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation signaling.",1
"Abstract
G protein-coupled receptor 12 (GPR12) is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that is highly expressed in the thalamus of the brain and plays a vital role in driving thalamocortical functions in short-term memory. GPR12 performs high constitutive activity and couples with Gs, increasing the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level when it is expressed. However, exploitation for drug development is limited since it is unclear how GPR12 initiates self-activation and signal transduction, and whether it can be modulated by endogenous or synthetic ligands. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the GPR12-Gs complex in the absence of agonists. Our structure reveals the key determinants for the intrinsically high basal activity of GPR12, including extracellular loop 2 partially occupying the orthosteric binding pocket, a tight-packed TM1 and TM7, and unique activation-related residues in TM6 and TM7. Together with mutagenesis data, this study will improve our understanding of the function and self-activation of the orphan receptor GPR12, enable the identification of endogenous ligands, and guide drug discovery efforts that target GPR12.",1
"Abstract
So far, the role of Ether à go-go 1 (Eag1) potassium channels in migration and invasion progression of cancers remains elusive. In the present study, the effects of Eag1 knockdown on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis were examined. Then, we evaluated the effects of Eag1 silencing on osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. In addition, we detected the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in osteosarcoma cell treated with Eag1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Finally, STAT3 siRNA was employed to determine the influence of downregulation of STAT3 on cell proliferation and migration. The results showed that knockdown of Eag1 significantly suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation and osteosarcoma xenografts growth. However, Eag1 silencing had little effect on cell apoptosis. Additionally, osteosarcoma cell adhesion, migration, and invasion were also potently attenuated. Notably, the expression levels of VEGF decreased evidently upon Eag1 siRNAs treatment, paralleled with reductions in the expression levels of STAT3. Moreover, a similar pattern was observed in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration suppression between STAT3 siRNA and Eag1 siRNAs groups. Our data indicated that Eag1 promotes osteosarcoma proliferation and migration, at least in part, by targeting STAT3-VEGF pathway.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common liver neoplasm, the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Moreover, its incidence has increased dramatically in the past decade. While surgical resection and liver transplantation are the main curative treatments, only around 20% of people with early hepatocellular carcinoma may benefit from these therapies. Current treatment options for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma include various ablative and transarterial therapies in addition to the drug sorafenib.

Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of external beam radiotherapy in the management of localised unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and clinicaltrials.gov registry. We also checked reference lists of primary original studies and review articles manually for further related articles (cross‐references) up to October 6, 2016.

Selection criteria
Eligible studies included all randomised clinical trials comparing external beam radiotherapy either as a monotherapy or in combination with other systemic or locoregional therapies versus placebo, no treatment, or other systemic or locoregional therapies for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used a random‐effects model as well as a fixed‐effect model meta‐analysis but in case of discrepancy between the two models (e.g. one giving a significant intervention effect, the other no significant intervention effect), we reported both results; otherwise, we reported only the results from the fixed‐effect model meta‐analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials using predefined risk of bias domains; assessed risks of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis; and presented the review results incorporating the methodological quality of the trials using GRADE.

Main results
Nine randomised clinical trials with 879 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low quality. All of the included trials compared combined external beam radiotherapy plus chemoembolisation versus chemoembolisation alone in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma; moreover, three of the trials compared external beam radiotherapy alone versus chemoembolisation alone. All trials were conducted in China. The median age in most of the included trials was around 52 years, and most trial participants were male. The median follow‐up duration ranged from one to three years. None of the trials reported data on cancer‐related mortality, quality of life, serious adverse events, or time to progression of the tumour. For the comparison of radiotherapy plus chemoembolisation versus chemoembolisation alone, the risk ratio for one‐year all‐cause mortality was 0.51 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.62; P < 0.001; 9 trials; low‐quality evidence); for complete response rate was 2.14 (95% CI 1.47 to 3.13; P < 0.001; 7 trials; low‐quality evidence); and for overall response rate defined as complete response plus partial response was 1.58 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.78; P < 0.001; 7 trials; low‐quality evidence), all in favour of combined treatment with external beam radiotherapy plus transarterial chemoembolisation and seemingly supported by our Trial Sequential Analysis. Additionally, the combined treatment was associated with a higher risk of elevated total bilirubin and elevated alanine aminotransferase. The risk ratio for the risk of elevated alanine aminotransferase was 1.41 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.84; P = 0.01; very low‐quality evidence), while for elevated total bilirubin it was 2.69 (95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; P = 0.005; very low‐quality evidence). For the comparison of radiotherapy versus chemoembolisation, the risk ratio for one‐year all‐cause mortality was 1.21 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.50; 3 trials; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) which was not supported by our Trial Sequential Analysis.

In addition, we found seven ongoing randomised clinical trials evaluating different external beam radiotherapy techniques for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐ and low‐quality evidence suggesting that combined external beam radiotherapy and chemoembolisation may be associated with lower mortality and increased complete and overall response rates, despite an increased toxicity as expressed by a higher rise of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase. A high risk of systematic errors (bias) as well as imprecision and inconsistency suggest that these findings should be considered cautiously and that high‐quality trials are needed to assess further the role of external beam radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.",1

STUDY QUESTION
Is exposure to dydrogesterone a risk factor for congenital anomalies when given in the first trimester for recurrent/threatened pregnancy loss or as luteal support in assisted reproductive technology (ART)?

SUMMARY ANSWER
Dydrogesterone, when given in the first trimester for recurrent/threatened pregnancy loss or as luteal support in ART, is not a relevant additional risk factor for congenital anomalies.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Despite large clinical trials and meta-analyses that show no association between dydrogesterone and congenital anomalies, some recently retracted publications have postulated an association with teratogenicity. Dydrogesterone is also often rated as less safe than bioidentical progestins.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
A systematic review was conducted according to a pre-specified protocol with searches on Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Clinicaltrials.gov. The search was limited to human studies, with no restrictions on language, geographical region, or date. The search algorithm used a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)-style approach combining both simple search terms and medical subject heading terms. As congenital anomalies are mostly reported as secondary outcomes, the search term ‘safety’ was added.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
Interventional study and observational study (OS) designs were eligible for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were: women >17 years old treated for threatened miscarriage, recurrent pregnancy loss, and/or ART; the use of dydrogesterone in the first trimester compared with placebo, no treatment or other interventions; and reporting of congenital anomalies in newborns or infants ≤12 months old (primary outcome). Two authors (A.K., M.R.N.) independently extracted the following data: general study information, study population details, intervention and comparator(s), and frequencies of congenital anomalies (classification, time of determination, and type). Risk of bias focused on the reporting of congenital malformations and was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool Version 2 or the ROBINS-I tool. The GRADEproGDT platform was used to generate the GRADE summary of findings table.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Of the 897 records retrieved during the literature search, 47 were assessed for eligibility. Nine studies were included in the final analysis: six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three OSs. Among the RCTs, three had a low risk and three a high risk of bias. Two of the OSs were considered to have a serious risk of bias and one with critical risk of bias and was excluded for the evidence syntheses. The eight remaining studies included a total of 5070 participants and 2680 live births from 16 countries. In the meta-analysis of RCTs only, the overall risk ratio (RR) was 0.92 [95% CI 0.55; 1.55] with low certainty. When the two OSs were included, the overall RR was 1.11 [95% CI 0.73; 1.68] with low certainty.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
The studies included in the analysis do not report congenital anomalies as the primary outcome; reporting of congenital anomalies was often not standardized.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
This systematic literature review and meta-analysis provide clear reassurance to both clinicians and patients that dydrogesterone is not associated with congenital anomalies above the rate that might be expected due to environmental and genetic factors. The results of this work represent the highest current level of evidence for the question of congenital anomalies, which removes the existing uncertainty caused by poor quality and retracted studies.

"Abstract
Some studies report that obesity is associated with more severe symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, however many other studies have not reproduced these findings. Therefore, it is uncertain whether obesity is in fact associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-obese individuals. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed (including MEDLINE) and Google Scholar on May 18, 2020 to identify published studies on COVID-19 outcomes in non-obese and obese patients, covering studies published during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Meta-analyses with random effects modeling was used to determine unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for various COVID-19 outcomes in obese versus non-obese patients. By quantitative analyses of 22 studies from 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, we found that obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of presenting with more severe COVID-19 symptoms (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.45–6.28, P = 0.003; 4 studies, n = 974), developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.14–7.34, P = 0.025; 2 studies, n = 96), requiring hospitalization (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14–1.59, P < 0.001; 4 studies, n = 6611), being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15–1.65, P = 0.001; 9 studies, n = 5298), and undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV; OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.29–2.40, P < 0.001; 7 studies, n = 1558) compared to non-obese patients. However, obese patients had similar likelihoods of death from COVID-19 as non-obese patients (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74–1.25, P = 0.750; 9 studies, n = 20,597). Collectively, these data from the first 6 months of the pandemic suggested that obesity is associated with a more severe COVID-19 disease course but may not be associated with increased mortality.

"Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms in the generation of neural stem cells from pluripotent stem cells is a fundamental step towards successful management of neurodegenerative diseases in translational medicine. Albeit all-trans retinoic acid (RA) has been associated with axon outgrowth and nerve regeneration, the maintenance of differentiated neurons, the association with degenerative disease like Parkinson's disease, and its regulatory molecular mechanism from pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells remain fragmented. We have previously reported that RA is capable of differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells to dopamine (DA) committed progenitor cells. Intracranial implantation of such neural progenitor cells into the 6-OHDA-lesioned substantia nigra pars compacta successfully regenerates dopaminergic neurons and integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway, ameliorating the behavioral deficits in the Parkinson’s disease rat model. Here, we demonstrated a dynamic molecular network in systematic analysis by addressing spatiotemporal molecular expression, intracellular protein-protein interaction and inhibition, imaging study, and genetic expression to explore the regulatory mechanisms of RA induction in the differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells to DA committed progenitor cells. We focused on the tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk), G proteins, canonical Wnt2B/β-catenin, genomic and non-genomic RA signaling transductions with Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression as the differentiation endpoint. We found that at the early stage, integration of TrkA and G protein signalings aims for axonogenesis and morphogenesis, involving the novel RXRα/Gαq/11 and RARβ/Gβ signaling pathways. While at the later stage, five distinct signaling pathways together with epigenetic histone modifications emerged to regulate expression of TH, a precursor of dopamine. RA induction generated DA committed progenitor cells in one day. Our results provided substantial mechanistic evidence that human trophoblast stem cell-derived neural stem cells can potentially be used for neurobiological study, drug discovery, and as an alternative source of cell-based therapy in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease.",1
"Abstract
In the present study, we investigated the relation between cognitive performance and heart rate variability as a function of fitness level. We measured the effect of three cognitive tasks (the psychomotor vigilance task, a temporal orienting task, and a duration discrimination task) on the heart rate variability of two groups of participants: a high-fit group and a low-fit group. Two major novel findings emerged from this study. First, the lowest values of heart rate variability were found during performance of the duration discrimination task, compared to the other two tasks. Second, the results showed a decrement in heart rate variability as a function of the time on task, although only in the low-fit group. Moreover, the high-fit group showed overall faster reaction times than the low-fit group in the psychomotor vigilance task, while there were not significant differences in performance between the two groups of participants in the other two cognitive tasks. In sum, our results highlighted the influence of cognitive processing on heart rate variability. Importantly, both behavioral and physiological results suggested that the main benefit obtained as a result of fitness level appeared to be associated with processes involving sustained attention.",1
"Abstract
■ Selection mechanisms that dynamically gate only relevant perceptual information for further processing and sustained representation in working memory are critical for goal-directed
behavior. We examined whether this gating process can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC)—a region known to play
a key role in working memory and conscious access. Specifically,
we examined the effects of tDCS on the magnitude of the “attentional blink”(AB), a deficit in identifying the second of two targets
presented in rapid succession. Thirty-four participants performed
an AB task before (baseline), during and after 20 min of 1-mA
anodal and cathodal tDCS in two separate sessions. On the basis
of previous reports linking individual differences in AB magnitude
to individual differences in DLPFC activity and on the basis of suggestions that effects of tDCS depend on baseline brain activity
levels, we hypothesized that anodal tDCS over lDLPFC would
modulate the magnitude of the AB as a function of individual
baseline AB magnitude. Behavioral results did not provide
support for this hypothesis. At the group level, we also did not
observe any significant effects of tDCS, and a Bayesian analysis
revealed strong evidence that tDCS to lDLPFC did not affect AB
performance. Together, these findings do not support the idea
that there is an optimal level of prefrontal cortical excitability
for cognitive function. More generally, they add to a growing body
of work that challenges the idea that the effects of tDCS can be
predicted from baseline levels of behavior. ■",1
"ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials able to effectively absorb near-infrared (NIR) radiation have shown considerable
potential as multifunctional platforms in the treatment of cancer.
Here, we report a molybdenum dioxide (MoOx)-based system for
synergistic chemo- and photothermal therapy of cancer. MoOx
nanosheets were generated via a one-step hydrothermal route, grafted
with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and decorated with melanin (Mel),
with successful functionalization confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The
mean diameter and thickness of the MoOx particles were found to be
302 ± 34 nm and 19 ± 2 nm using atomic force microscopy. The
hydrodynamic size of the MoOx nanosheets was 105 ± 17 nm, and
the resulting final MoOx-PEG-Mel-DOX nanocomposite formulation
had a uniform diameter of 161 ± 26 nm. The MoOx-PEG-Mel
nanosheets efficiently convert NIR light to heat, possessing a
photothermal conversion efficiency of 61.7%. They can also be loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), giving a
high drug loading (325.6 mg DOX/g MoOx-PEG-Mel). DOX release from the formulation is influenced by both pH and NIR
irradiation. Systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations reveal that synergistic chemo- and photothermal therapy using MoOxPEG-Mel-DOX can completely eradicate a tumor with no observable off-target cytotoxicity. This is the first report of the
fabrication of enhanced photothermal agents by combining MoOx nanosheets and a natural product. This work proffers a
strategy for efficiently treating cancer as well as potentially extending the photothermal applications of 2D nanomaterials by
surface melanin functionalization.

"Abstract
A simple design for a copolarization wideband metamaterial absorber (MA) for C-band applications is proposed. The unit cell of the proposed MA is designed by combining half-moon-shaped resonator and interior circle resonator structures, on flame retardant 4 substrate. The absorption performance of the proposed absorber is investigated using Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio simulations. The MA design parameters are optimized based on analysis of the equivalent circuit model. The designed absorber achieves copolarization absorptivity above 90% across the entire C-band from 3.95 GHz to 8.02 GHz under normal incidence for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. Moreover, the average absorption remains above 80% even for angles of incidence up to 60° under both TE and TM polarizations. The physical mechanism of the MA is investigated by using the electric and surface current distributions, which is also supported by the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters. The designed structure is compact (unit cell dimension of ∼ λ/6.5 and thickness of ∼ λ/11.8 at the center frequency), broadband, and insensitive to the angle of incidence across a wide range, enabling applications in C-band defense and stealth systems.",1
"Abstract
Background
High rates of revision surgery have been reported for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), with weight regain (WR) as the most frequently reported cause. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed revision procedure, whereas one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is a less popular approach.

Methods
A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred seventy-six patients were enrolled and randomized. After loss to follow-up, 80 patients for RYGB and 80 patients for OAGB were analyzed, with a 2-year follow-up. Patients with grade B or higher gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were excluded. Early and late postoperative complications were recorded. Body mass index (BMI), percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL), nutritional laboratory test results, and the resolution of associated medical problems were assessed after revision surgery.

Results
After 2 years, both groups achieved significantly lower BMI than their post-LSG nadir BMI (p < 0.001). The %EBMIL changes showed significantly faster weight loss in the OAGB group than in the RYGB at the 6-month follow-up (mean difference: 8.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2 to 16.9%). However, at 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, the differences were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Early and late complications were similar between two groups. Both groups showed improvement or resolution of associated medical problems, with no statistically significant differences after 2 years (p = 1.00).

Conclusion
Both revisional RYGB and OAGB have comparable significant weight loss effects when performed for WR after LSG. After a 2-year follow-up, both procedures were safe, with no significant differences in the occurrence of complications and nutritional deficits.",1
"Abstract
Eyewitness identification experiments typically involve a single trial: A participant views an event and subsequently makes a lineup decision. As compared to this single-trial paradigm, multiple-trial designs are more efficient, but significantly reduce ecological validity and may affect the strategies that participants use to make lineup decisions. We examined the effects of a number of forensically relevant variables (i.e., memory strength, type of disguise, degree of disguise, and lineup type) on eyewitness accuracy, choosing, and confidence across 12 target-present and 12 target-absent lineup trials (N = 349; 8,376 lineup decisions). The rates of correct rejections and choosing (across both target-present and target-absent lineups) did not vary across the 24 trials, as reflected by main effects or interactions with trial number. Trial number had a significant but trivial quadratic effect on correct identifications (OR = 0.99) and interacted significantly, but again trivially, with disguise type (OR = 1.00). Trial number did not significantly influence participants’ confidence in correct identifications, confidence in correct rejections, or confidence in target-absent selections. Thus, multiple-trial designs appear to have minimal effects on eyewitness accuracy, choosing, and confidence. Researchers should thus consider using multiple-trial designs for conducting eyewitness identification experiments.",1
"Abstract
Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening disease arising from a progressive
increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, irreversible pulmonary vascular remodeling and resulting in
right ventricular failure. Recent studies suggested that pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell
proliferation and migration played an important role in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced pulmonary
hypertension. However, the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension are complicated
and largely unclear. In this study, we discovered that lncRNA MEG3 was down-regulated in human
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell in hypoxia, and inhibition of MEG3 promoted the cell
proliferation and cell migration in both normal and hypoxia condition. Further study demonstrated that
MEG3 exerted its function via regulation of miR-21 expression in both normal and hypoxia condition.
In addition, we displayed the modulation of PTEN by miR-21 and their role in hypoxia. Ultimately, our
study illustrated that MEG3 exerts its role via miR-21/ PTEN axis in human pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cell under both normal and hypoxia conditions.

"We introduce three modifications to the die-in-a-cup paradigm to gain novel insights into dishonest behavior under time pressure. The regular die is substituted with a custom one that has a distinct color on each side as a way of manipulating familiarity with the decision situation. The cup is substituted with a ‘dice tower' to control the randomization process. Alongside outcome data, we capture mouse cursor trajectories. Results from our preregistered laboratory experiment involving 229 subjects suggest that time pressure increases dishonesty only when the regular die is used. Mouse tracking analysis suggests that it takes more effort to be honest than to lie outright and that partial lying is most difficult.",1

In vitro, down-regulation of microRNA-126 (miR-126) and silencing PIK3R2 gene expression or increasing PIK3
pathway inhibitor were performed to explore whether miR-126-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by
targeting PIK3R2 affects the proliferation, migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells.
Background: Our study explored whether the microRNA-126 (miR-126)-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT (phosphatase and
tensin homology deleted on chromosome 10/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit-b/AKT) signaling
pathway by targeting PIK3R2 affects the proliferation, migration, and invasion of nonesmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
A549 cells. Materials and Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the
expression of miR-126 in A549 cells. The MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) assay, cell scratch test, Transwell assay,
and Western blot were used to detect the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 cells and protein expression in
A549 cells, respectively. Results: The expression of miR-126 decreased and the expression of PIK3R2 increased in
A549 cells (P < .05, for both). Upregulation of miR-126 resulted in the decrease of the proliferation, migration, and
invasive abilities of A549 cells, the downregulation of the expression of PIK3R2, PI3K, and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt)
protein, and the upregulation of PTEN expression (P < .05 for all). Also, these abilities of A549 cells increased, and the
expression of these 3 proteins was upregulated with downregulation of miR-126 (P < .05 for all). The results of the dual
luciferase reporter gene assay showed that PIK3R2 was the target gene of miR-126. PIK3R2, PI3K, and p-Akt proteins
were downregulated, but PTEN protein was upregulated as PIK3R2 was silenced or the inhibitor of the PTEN/PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway increased. Also, downregulation of miR-126 with silencing of PIK3R2 or increasing the inhibitor
of the pathway caused increased PI3K and p-Akt protein expression and increased active proliferation, migration, and
invasive abilities of A549 cells (P < .05 for all). Conclusion: The upregulation of miR-126 in NSCLC A549 cells can
reduce the expression of the target gene PIK3R2 and influence the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suppressing
the proliferation, migration, and invasive abilities of A549 cells.",1
"Abstract
Exposure to media coverage of mass violence has been shown to predict poorer mental health symptomology. However, it is unknown whether such media coverage can have ubiquitous effects on average community members, extending to biological and perceptual processes that underlie everyday decision making and behavior. Here, we used a repeated-measures design over the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings to track participants’ self-reported distress, their eye blink startle reactivity while viewing images of the bombings, and their ability to perceptually distinguish armed from unarmed individuals in a behavioral shooting task. We leveraged a computational linguistics method in which we sampled news content from the sources our participants most commonly self-reported reading, and then quantified both the extent of news coverage about the marathon and the affective tone of that news coverage. Results revealed that participants experienced greater current distress, greater physiological reactivity to threats, and poorer perceptual sensitivity when recent news coverage of the marathon contained more affectively negative words. This is the first empirical work to examine relationships between the media’s affective tone in its coverage of mass violence and individuals’ threat perception and physiological threat reactivity.",1

Objective
Colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) are implicated in colorectal cancer carcinogenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The identification of these cells could help to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has been viewed as a marker for gastrointestinal stem cells that fuel the self-renewal process, however others view them as a marker of Tuft cells or as an enteroendocrine subtype. The purpose of this study was to use a colon cancer cell line to identify and characterize the stem-like characteristics of the DCLK1+ cell population.

Methods
To enrich stem-like cells, HCT116 cells (derived from colon adenocarcinomas) were cultured using serum-free media to form spheres under both normal oxygen and hypoxia condition. DCLK1 transcript expression in the adherent parental cells and spheroids was quantified using quantitative real time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction [(q)RT-PCR]. DCLK1 protein expression was determined using flow cytometry. Self-renewal capability from adherent parental cells and spheroids was determined using extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA).

Results
Under both normal oxygen and hypoxia condition, the adherent parental cells were composed of cells that express low levels of DCLK1. However, spheroids exhibited an increased frequency of cells expressing DCLK1 on both mRNA and protein levels. Cells derived from spheroids also possess stronger self-renewal capability.

Conclusions
The higher fraction of DCLK1+ cells exhibited by spheroids and hypoxia reflects the stem-like characteristics of these cells. DCLK1 may represent an ideal marker to study and develop effective strategies to overcome chemo-resistance and relapse of colon cancer.

"Abstract
The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic value of high spatial resolution time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectory (TWIST) using Gadobutrol to Computed tomography angiography (CTA) for preoperative evaluation of lower extremity tumors.

This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Fifty consecutive patients (31 men, 19 women, age range 18–80 years, average age 42.7 years) with lower extremity tumors underwent TWIST magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CTA. Digital subtraction angiography was available for 8 patients. Image quality of MRA was compared with CTA by 2 radiologists according to a 4-point Likert scale. Arterial involvement by tumor was compared using kappa test between MRA and CTA. The ability to identify feeding arteries and arterio-venous fistulae (AVF) was compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar test, respectively.

Image quality of MRA and CTA was rated without a statistically significant difference (3.88 ± 0.37 vs. 3.97 ± 0.16, P = 0.135). Intramodality agreement was high for the identification of arterial invasion (kappa = 0.806 ± 0.073 for Reader 1, kappa = 0.805 ± 0.073 for Reader 2). Readers found AVF in 27 of 50 MRA cases and 14 of 50 CTA cases (P < 0.001). Mean feeding arteries identified with MRA were significantly more than that with CTA (2.08 ± 1.72 vs. 1.62 ± 1.52, P = .02).

TWIST MRA is a reliable imaging modality for the assessment of lower extremity tumors. TWIST MRA is comparable to CTA for the identification of AVF and feeding arteries.",1
"Abstract: Pain induced by endometriosis with high incidence was common which was reported to be associated
with activation of microglia. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) had been used to treat clinical pathological pain including
migraine, musculoskeletal pain and refractory trigeminal neuralgia effectively. We evaluated the effect of BoNT-A on
microglia activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro and microglia activation of spinal cord using a endometriosis mouse model (EMS). Oxytocin-induced writhing test on EMS mice was performed to investigate the effect
of BoNT-A on endometriosis pain. QPCR was used to measure mRNA expression and western blotting combined
with immunofluorescence and immunochemistry were used to detect protein expression. Inflammatory factors were
measured through ELISA. Our results showed that BoNT-A decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and PGE2 in the
supernatant of BV-2 cells which were activated by LPS. BoNT-A suppressed Iba-1 and OX42 expression mentioned
as markers of microglia activation, down-regulated P2X7, CX3R1, p-P38MAPK and p-JNK protein expression in

"Abstract The dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DLX6-AS1 has been identified to be involved in the development of several cancers, but its functional role and the underlying mechanism of DLX6-AS1 in breast cancer (BC) remains unknown. In the current study, the expression of DLX6-AS1 in BC tissue samples was evaluated, and the correlation between DLX6-AS1 expression and clinicopathological parameters was also analyzed.

We found that DLX6-AS1 expression was much higher in tumor tissues than in adjacent normal tissues and was positively associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. DLX6-AS1 knockdown significantly suppressed BC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while promoting apoptosis. Moreover, a luciferase reporter assay validated that DLX6-AS1 acted as an endogenous sponge to miR-505-3p and negatively regulated its expression.

Additionally, miR-505-3p inhibited runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression by directly binding to its 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR), and overexpression of RUNX2 partially reversed the effect of miR-505-3p mimics on BC cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, in BC tissues, miR-505-3p expression levels were inversely associated with DLX6-AS1 and RUNX2, respectively.

In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that DLX6-AS1 functioned as an oncogenic factor that promoted BC proliferation and invasion through the miR-505-3p/RUNX2 axis, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target for BC treatment.",1
"Abstract
Despite increasing representation in graduate training programs, a disproportionate number of women leave academic research without obtaining an independent position that enables them to train the next generation of academic researchers. To understand factors underlying this trend, we analyzed formal PhD and postdoctoral mentoring relationships in the life sciences during the years 2000 to 2020. Student and mentor gender are both associated with differences in rates of student’s continuation to positions that allow formal academic mentorship. Although trainees of women mentors are less likely to take on positions as academic mentors than trainees of men mentors, this effect is reduced substantially after controlling for several measurements of mentor status. Thus, the effect of mentor gender can be explained at least partially by gender disparities in social and financial resources available to mentors. Because trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender, this association between mentor gender and academic continuation disproportionately impacts women trainees. On average, gender homophily in graduate training is unrelated to mentor status. A notable exception to this trend is the special case of scientists having been granted an outstanding distinction, evidenced by membership in the National Academy of Sciences, being a grantee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or having been awarded the Nobel Prize. This group of mentors trains men graduate students at higher rates than their most successful colleagues. These results suggest that, in addition to other factors that limit career choices for women trainees, gender inequities in mentors’ access to resources and prestige contribute to women’s attrition from independent research positions.",1

Background
Nuclear histone proteins are released into the extracellular space during sepsis and act as major mediators of death. However, circulating histone levels have not been precisely quantified.

Methods
We developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of circulating histone H3 levels and evaluated its performance. Using the ELISA, we measured plasma histone H3 levels in C57BL/6 J mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis.

Results
The newly developed ELISA enabled reproducible measurement of histone H3 levels with a working range up to 250 ng/mL. Using the ELISA, we found that plasma histone H3 levels were elevated in septic mice compared with sham-operated mice (p < 0.01). The elevation of histone H3 levels was abrogated when neutrophils were depleted (p < 0.01).

Conclusions
Our novel ELISA provides reproducible measurements of histone H3 levels. Circulating histone H3 levels are increased in septic mice in a neutrophil-dependent manner. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of histone H3 levels in patients with sepsis.

"Abstract: A progressive neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Studies suggest that highly expressed protein isoaspartate methyltransferase 1 (PCMT1) in brain tissue. In the current study, we explored the effects of neural stem cell-conditioned medium (NSC-CDM) on the PCMT1/MST1 pathway to alleviate Aβ25-35-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells. Our data suggested that Aβ25-35 markedly inhibited cell viability. NSC-CDM or Neural stem cell-complete medium (NSC-CPM) had a suppression effect on toxicity when treatment with Aβ25-35, with a greater effect observed with NSC-CDM. Aβ25-35 + NSC-CDM group exhibited an increase in PCMT1 expression. sh-PCMT1 markedly decreased cell proliferation and suppressed the protective role of NSC-CDM through the induction of apoptosis and improved p-MST1 expression. Overexpression of PCMT1 reversed the Aβ25-35-induced decrease in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In summary, our findings suggest that NSC-CDM corrects the Aβ25-35- induced damage to cells by improving PCMT1 expressions, which in turn reduces phosphorylation of MST1.",1
"Background—Emerging studies suggest that early administration of dual antiplatelet therapy may be better than monotherapy for prevention of early recurrent stroke and cardiovascular outcomes in acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials evaluating dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy for acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA.
Methods and Results—We assessed randomized, controlled trials investigating dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy published up to November 2012 and the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events), for efficacy and safety outcomes in adult patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA with treatment initiated within 3 days of ictus. In total, 14 studies of 9012 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Dual antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced risk of stroke recurrence (risk ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.80; P<0.001) and the composite outcome of stroke, TIA, acute coronary syndrome, and all death (risk ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.81; P<0.001) when compared with monotherapy, and nonsignificantly increased risk of major bleeding (risk ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–2.59, P=0.37). Analyses restricted to the CHANCE Trial or the 7 double-blind randomized, controlled trials showed similar results.
Conclusions—For patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, dual therapy was more effective than monotherapy in reducing risks of early recurrent stroke. The results of the CHANCE study are consistent with previous studies done in other parts of the world. (Circulation. 2013;128:1656-1666.)

"As at mid-October 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been continuing on the rise across the globe, including in India. Historically, homeopathy has been used in a number of epidemics/pandemics. The development of homeopathic medicines is approached uniquely through “drug provings” and clinical verification; these two intrinsic processes establish the background for the application of homeo- pathic medicines, regardless of nosological diagnosis. This article reflects research initiatives on COVID-19 in India and identifies studies listed in the Clinical Trial Registry– India database. We identified 29 studies being undertaken in different settings, including those in conventional medicine: 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 observational studies. Fifteen studies are aimed at prophylaxis and 14 are aimed at treatment. Amongst the treatment studies, 11 are focused on efficacy or compara- tive effectiveness. The findings might provide evidence for clinically repurposing some
of homeopathy’s medicines, an approach that is intrinsic to the therapy, enabling their use in COVID-19 as an adjuvant or stand-alone to help reduce costs and improve patient recovery.",1
"Abstract
The fermentation characteristics and aroma-producing properties of Lactobacilli could influence the flavour quality of fermented milk, an important influencing factor of consumers' preference. In this study, fermented milk was prepared using Lactobacillus helveticus and the dynamic changes in the sensory quality of fermented milk throught fermentation were to assess the dynamic changes in sensory quality of fermented milks throughout the fermentation process, including rheological properties and flavour profiles. Styrene, linalool, octanoic acid, and 1-nonanol were considered as the key flavour components during fermentation. The quality of the fermented milk tends to be stabilized after 24-h, showing the minimal off-flavour at 48-h and optimal fermented aroma at 72-h. Three prebiotics (inulin, Galactooligosaccharides and inulin mixed with Galactooligosaccharides) were added to Lactobacillus spiralis fermented milk separately, and the results showed that inulin mixed with Galactooligosaccharides was the most effective group in improving the organoleptic quality of the fermented milk. Overall, the experimental results provide deeper insights into the release and retention of aroma compounds during fermentation and scientific reference for broadening the application of prebiotics and flavour-producing Lactobacilli in fermented milk processing.",1

Background
A fundamental feature of parasitism is the nutritional exploitation of host organisms by their parasites. Parasitoid wasps lay eggs on arthropod hosts, exploiting them for nutrition to support larval development by using diverse effectors aimed at regulating host metabolism. However, the genetic components and molecular mechanisms at the basis of such exploitation, especially the utilization of host amino acid resources, remain largely unknown. To address this question, here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of the parasitoid wasp Cotesia chilonis and reconstruct its amino acid biosynthetic pathway.

Results
Analyses of the amino acid synthetic pathway indicate that C. chilonis lost the ability to synthesize ten amino acids, which was confirmed by feeding experiments with amino acid-depleted media. Of the ten pathways, nine are known to have been lost in the common ancestor of animals. We find that the ability to synthesize arginine was also lost in C. chilonis because of the absence of two key genes in the arginine synthesis pathway. Further analyses of the genomes of 72 arthropods species show that the loss of arginine synthesis is common in arthropods. Metabolomic analyses by UPLC-MS/MS reveal that the temporal concentrations of arginine, serine, tyrosine, and alanine are significantly higher in host (Chilo suppressalis) hemolymph at 3 days after parasitism, whereas the temporal levels of 5-hydroxylysine, glutamic acid, methionine, and lysine are significantly lower. We sequence the transcriptomes of a parasitized host and non-parasitized control. Differential gene expression analyses using these transcriptomes indicate that parasitoid wasps inhibit amino acid utilization and activate protein degradation in the host, likely resulting in the increase of amino acid content in host hemolymph.

Conclusions
We sequenced the genome of a parasitoid wasp, C. chilonis, and revealed the features of trait loss in amino acid biosynthesis. Our work provides new insights into amino acid exploitation by parasitoid wasps, and this knowledge can specifically be used to design parasitoid artificial diets that potentially benefit mass rearing of parasitoids for pest control.",1
"Abstract
Background
The use of cephalo-medullary nails (CMN) is a widely accepted management option for the treatment of unstable per-trochanteric hip fractures. A growing body of literature has reported good functional and radiological outcomes in patients managed with a dynamic hip screw supplemented with a trochanteric stabilisation plate (DHS w/ TSP). However, a robust meta-analysis does not exist in the current literature comparing the two fixation methods.

Purposes
Management of these kinds of injuries is very challenging in orthopaedic practice, yet no strong evidence is in place to delineate which implant gives the best results. This meta-analysis is the first to determine the efficacy of CMN versus DHS w/ TSP.

Methods
An up-to-date literature search was performed using a predetermined search strategy and eligibility criteria. All suitable literature was appraised for methodological quality using the Cochrane’s collaboration tool. Hospital stay, operative time, intra-operative complication rate, mechanical failure rate, infection rates, revision rates and functional outcomes were all considered.

Results
A total of five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of this analysis suggest that CMN is only associated with lower revision rates when compared to DHS w/ TSP; however, no significant difference was found in terms of hospital stay, operative time, blood transfusion, complications rate and functional outcome.

Conclusion
Both CMN and DHS w/TSP proved to be reliable in the management of unstable per-trochanteric fractures; however, more extensive datasets are required to draw robust conclusions.",1

Wear debris-induced osteolysis is the leading cause of aseptic loosening, which is the most common rea- son for total hip arthroplasty (THA) failure in the medium and long term. Although osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone and make direct contact with implants, the interaction between osteocytes and wear debris remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of TiAl6V4 alloy particles (TiPs) on osteocytes and the subsequent effects on osteoclast formation. Our study demon- strated that osteocyte-conditioned medium (CM) inhibited osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) to osteoclasts. However, TiPs attenuated this inhibitory effect. The expression of sev- eral osteoclastogenesis-associated factors, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), nitric oxide (NO) and interferon-beta (IFN-b), was examined, and we found that TiPs markedly decreased the expression of IFN-b, but not the other factors. In an osteoclasto- genesis assay, our results suggested that the downregulation of IFN-b mediated the stimulatory effect of TiPs on osteoclastogenesis. Additional evidence suggested that TiPs decreased the expression of IFN-b in osteocytes via macroautophagy (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘autophagy”). Moreover, inhibiting autophagy with Atg5 siRNA prevented the increase in osteoclastogenesis induced by TiPs. Collectively, these results suggested a possible mechanism underlying wear debris-induced osteolysis.",1

Background
Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia are the main asbestos-producing countries, and all forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. The objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019 in major producing countries, including Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.

Methods
Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates (ASDR) of disease burden attributable to asbestos by country, age, and sex were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2019. Percentage change and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were used to assess the trends of ASDR and ASMR of disease burden attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019.

Results
Asbestos-related diseases were highly heterogeneous across Global, Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. There was a downward trend in ASMR and ASDR of diseases burden related to asbestos globally. The age-specific mortality rate of disease attributable to asbestos increased in men and women, although it decreased in women aged 85–89, the highest age-specific mortality rate were observed in age 95 + group in men [162.14 (95% UI: 103.76–215.45)] and women [30.58 (95% UI: 14.83–44.33)] per 100 000 population, respectively. Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause of death and DALYS attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019 globally and in Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. China had the highest percentage change (73.31%) and EAPC [3.41 (95% CI: 2.75–4.08)] in ASMR related to exposure to asbestos in men, with the highest percentage change (73.31%) and EAPC [3.41 (95% CI: 2.75–4.08)] in ASDR in men.

Conclusions
The ASMR and ASDR of disease burden attributable to asbestos decreased between 1990 and 2019 globally. TBL cancer was the leading cause of death and DALYs attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019. There has been an increasing trend in mortality and DALYs globally, especially in older men. The burden of disease attributable to asbestos is increasing in China, especially in men.",1
"Abstract
Long non‑coding RNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) exerts inhibitory effects through the modulation of several target microRNAs (miRs) in cancer. However, its potential roles and underlying relationship during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression are unclear. Therefore, we explored the role of the negative feedback loop formed by the GAS5/miR‑34a axis and mammalian target of rapamycin/sirtuin 1 (mTOR/SIRT1) pathway on macroautophagy and apoptosis in CRC. Expression of GAS5, miR‑34a, SIRT1 and mTOR in CRC patients and cell lines was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Online bioinformatic analysis was used to predict the downstream miRs of GAS5. Luciferase assay and western blotting were performed to demonstrate miR‑34a as a downstream target gene of GAS5 in CRC cells. The effects of the GAS5/miR‑34a axis on apoptosis, macroautophagy, and the mTOR/SIRT1 pathway were assessed by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting, respectively. Our results suggested that GAS5 was downregulated and acted as a molecular sponge of miR‑34a during CRC progression. miR‑34a participated in regulating GAS5‑suppressed CRC cell macroautophagy and induced apoptosis through the mTOR/SIRT1 pathway. GAS5‑mediated macroautophagy was maintained in an equilibrium state that might have a protective effect on CRC cell apoptosis. The mTOR signaling pathway suppressed GAS5 expression and formed a negative regulation feedback loop with miR‑34a in CRC cells. Our results suggested that the GAS5/miR‑34a/SIRT1/mTOR negative regulatory feedback loop mediated CRC cell macroautophagy, and maintained the cells in an autonomous equilibrium state, but not excessive activation state, which functions as a strong antiapoptotic phenotype during human CRC progression.",1

Objective
Early surgical resection remains the recommended treatment option for most small renal mass (≤4 cm). We examined long-term overall survival (OS) of patients managed with delayed and immediate nephrectomy of cT1a renal cancer.

Patient and methods
We utilized the National Cancer Database (2005-2010) to identify 14,677 patients (immediate nephrectomy: 14,050 patients vs late nephrectomy: 627 patients) aged <70 years with Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) 0 and cT1aN0M0 renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Immediate nephrectomy and late nephrectomy were defined as nephrectomy performed <30 days and >180 days from diagnosis respectively. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)–adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to compare OS of patients in the two treatment arms. Influence of patient age and CCI on treatment effect was tested by interactions. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the outcome of delaying nephrectomy for >12 months.

Results
Median patient age was 55 years with a median follow-up of 82.5 months. IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves suggest no significant difference between treatment arms (immediate nephrectomy [<30 days] vs delayed nephrectomy [>180 days]) (Hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.26; p=0.77). This outcome was consistent between all patients regardless of age (p=0.48). Sensitivity analysis report no difference in OS even if nephrectomy was delayed by >12 months (p=0.60).

Conclusion
We report that delayed and immediate nephrectomy for cT1a RCC confers comparable long-term OS. These findings suggest that a period of observation of between 6-12 months is safe to allow identification of renal masses, which will benefit from surgical resection.",1
"Abstract
Coccolithophores are unicellular phytoplankton that produce calcium carbonate coccoliths as an exoskeleton. Emiliania huxleyi, the most abundant coccolithophore in the world's ocean, plays a major role in the global carbon cycle by regulating the exchange of CO2 across the ocean-atmosphere interface through photosynthesis and calcium carbonate precipitation. As CO2 concentration is rising in the atmosphere, the ocean is acidifying and ammonium (NH4+) concentration of future ocean water is expected to rise. The latter is attributed to increasing anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, increasing rates of cyanobacterial N2 fixation due to warmer and more stratified oceans, and decreased rates of nitrification due to ocean acidification. Thus, future global climate change will cause oceanic phytoplankton to experience changes in multiple environmental parameters including CO2, pH, temperature and nitrogen source. This study reports on the combined effect of elevated pCO2 and increased NH4+ to nitrate (NO3−) ratio (NH4+/NO3−) on E. huxleyi, maintained in continuous cultures for more than 200 generations under two pCO2 levels and two different N sources. Herein, we show that NH4+ assimilation under N-replete conditions depresses calcification at both low and high pCO2, alters coccolith morphology, and increases primary production. We observed that N source and pCO2 synergistically drive growth rates, cell size, and the ratio of inorganic to organic carbon. These responses to N source suggest that, compared to increasing CO2 alone, a greater disruption of the organic carbon pump could be expected in response to the combined effect of increased NH4+/NO3− ratio and CO2 level in the future acidified ocean. Additional experiments conducted under lower nutrient conditions are needed prior to extrapolating our findings to the global oceans. Nonetheless, our results emphasize the need to assess combined effects of multiple environmental parameters on phytoplankton biology to develop accurate predictions of phytoplankton responses to ocean acidification.",1
"Abstract
Three amino acid transporter genes (AAP3-5) were isolated from Arabidopsis by complementation of a yeast mutant defective in histidine uptake. Transport is driven against a concentration gradient and sensitive to protonophores. Analysis of the substrate specificity demonstrates that the carriers have a broad substrate specificity covering the major transport forms of reduced nitrogen, i.e. glutamine and glutamate. The transporters have similar affinities for glutamate, glutamine, and alanine but differ with respect to valine, phenylalanine, histidine, arginine, and lysine. AAP3 and AAP5 efficiently transport arginine and lysine and are involved in basic amino acid transport. The predicted polypeptides of 53 kDa are highly hydrophobic with 12 putative membrane-spanning regions and show significant homologies to Arabidopsis amino acid transporters AAP1 and AAP2. Each of the genes has a different organ-specific expression in the plant. AAP3 is exclusively expressed in roots and AAP4 mainly in source leaves, stems, and flowers, whereas AAP5 is found in all tissues. The specific distribution in the plant and the different substrate specificities of AAP transporters may indicate that tissues differ both qualitatively and quantitatively regarding import or export of amino acids.
In most plants, the major transport forms for organic nitrogen are amino acids. A spectrum of different amino acids is found in both phloem and xylem. Roots or leaves can be sources for amino acids cycling through the plant, allowing withdrawal in tissues that are dependent on external supply, e.g. seeds (Pate, 1975). Composition of phloem and xylem sap and of mesophyll cytosol are highly similar, indicating that nonspecific loading processes are involved (Jeschke et al., 1991; Riens et al., 1991). Evidence for carrier-mediated phloem loading with sucrose has been shown for several plants including potato, tobacco, and Arabidopsis (von Schaewen et al., 1990; Riesmeier et al., 1994). It is therefore probable that similar mechanisms are used for amino acid transport. Transport measurements have provided evidence for the presence of low and high affinity amino acid transport systems in a number of plant species (for recent reviews see Bush(1993); Frommer et al. (1994b)). Analysis of amino acid transport mutants has indicated that in Nicotiana leaves a single locus is responsible for uptake of a broad spectrum of amino acids (Marion-Poll et al., 1988). Uptake studies in plasma membrane vesicles from sugar beet leaves have revealed complex kinetics that were interpreted to result from the activity of at least four different transporters specific for acidic, neutral, or basic amino acids (Li and Bush, 1990). In all cases, transport was active and proton-coupled (Bush, 1993).
Several amino acid transporter genes have been isolated from Arabidopsis by complementation of yeast transport mutants defective in the uptake of certain amino acids. Up to now, three families of proteins capable of transporting amino acids have been found. All members of the first family of permeases (AAPs) transport a broad spectrum of amino acids and probably function as proton cotransporters (Frommer et al., 1993; Hsu et al., 1993; Kwart et al., 1993). A second class of proteins, AAT, is related to mammalian amino acid transporters and represents a high affinity, broad specificity system.1(1) A third system, NTR1, transports histidine with low efficiency but peptides with high affinity (Frommer et al., 1994a).2(2)
Using a sensitive selection system in a yeast histidine transport mutant, three new amino acid transporters were identified. To analyze this apparent redundance, sequences were compared with known amino acid transporters, substrate specificity was analyzed, and the expression pattern in the plant was determined.",1

Background
Patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who develop severe symptoms need to be determined in advance so that appropriate treatment strategies are in place.

Methods
To determine the clinic features of patients diagnosed definitely with COVID-19 and evaluate risk factors for severe outcome, the medical records of hospitalized patients were reviewed retrospectively by us and data were compiled. Laboratory data from 90 cases were analyzed, and COVID-19 patients were classified into two groups (severe and non-severe) based on the severity.

Results
Severe COVID-19 cases on admission had higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein levels, and lower lymphocyte counts compared with those of non-severe cases (p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for leukocyte counts, neutrophil counts, and levels of C-reactive protein was 0.778, 0.831, and 0.800, respectively. The thresholds were 7.70 × 109/L for leukocyte counts, 5.93 × 10⁹/L for neutrophil counts, and 75.07 mg/L for C-reactive protein, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05–1.71), neutrophil counts (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06–1.73), and C-reactive protein levels (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.0–1.04) were several predictive factors for severe outcome. Severe COVID-19 patients had a reduction in WBC counts, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen upon discharge from hospital, while lymphocyte counts increased (p < 0.05).

Conclusion
Counts of WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte, NLR, and levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and fibrinogen are helpful for prediction of the deterioration trend in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

"Background: Recent evidence highlights the fact that immunotherapy has significantly improved patient outcomes. CD93, as a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was correlated with tumor-associated angiogenesis; however, how CD93 correlates with immunotherapy in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains unclear.

Methods: TCGA, GTEx, GEO, TIMER2.0, HPA, TISIDB, TCIA, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, and ImmuCellAI public databases were used to elucidate CD93 in STAD. Visualization and statistical analysis of data were performed by R (Version 4.1.3), GraphPad (Version 8.0.1), and QuPath (Version 0.3.2).

Results: CD93 was highly expressed in STAD compared with adjacent normal tissues. The overexpression of CD93 was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis in STAD. There was a negative correlation between CD93 expression levels with CD93 mutation and methylation in STAD. Our results revealed that CD93 expression was positively associated with most immunosuppressive genes (including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and LAG3), immunostimulatory genes, HLA, chemokine, and chemokine receptor proteins in STAD. Furthermore, in STAD, CD93 was noticeably associated with the abundance of multiple immune cell infiltration levels. Functional HALLMARK and KEGG term enhancement analysis of CD93 through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was correlated with the process of the angiogenesis pathway. Subsequently, digital image analysis results by QuPath revealed that the properties of CD93+ cells were statistically significant in different regions of stomach cancer and normal stomach tissue. Finally, we utilized external databases, including GEO, TISIDB, ImmuCellAI, and TCIA, to validate that CD93 plays a key role in the immunotherapy of STAD.

Conclusion: Our study reveals that CD93 is a potential oncogene and is an indicative biomarker of a worse prognosis and exerts its immunomodulatory properties and potential possibilities for immunotherapy in STAD.",1
"Abstract
Objectives
To investigate the value of intralesional and perilesional radiomics based on computed tomography (CT) in predicting the bioactivity of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE).

Materials and methods
In this retrospective study, 131 patients who underwent surgical resection and diagnosed HAE in pathology were included (bioactive, n=69; bioinactive, n=62). All patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n=78) and validation cohort (n=53) in a 6:4 ratio. The gross lesion volume (GLV), perilesional volume (PLV), and gross combined perilesional volume (GPLV) radiomics features were extracted on CT images of portal vein phase. Feature selection was performed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), univariate analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Radiomics models were established by support vector machine (SVM). The Radscore of the best radiomics model and clinical independent predictors were combined to establish a clinical radiomics nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and decision curves were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram model.

Results
In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the GLV, PLV, and GPLV radiomic models was 0.774, 0.729, and 0.868, respectively. GPLV radiomic models performed best among the three models in training and validation cohort. Calcification type and fibrinogen were clinical independent predictors (p<0.05). The AUC of the nomogram-model-based clinical and GPLV radiomic signatures was 0.914 in the training cohort and 0.833 in the validation cohort. The decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram had greater benefits compared with the single radiomics model or clinical model.

Conclusion
The nomogram model based on clinical and GPLV radiomic signatures shows the best performance in prediction of the bioactivity of HAE. Radiomics including perilesional tissue can significantly improve the prediction efficacy of HAE bioactivity.

"PURPOSE: Dismissal from residency is most commonly
because of unprofessional conduct rather than cognitive
failure. Disciplinary action by medical boards has also been
associated with prior unprofessional behavior during medical school. Facebook is a social media network that has
become ubiquitous in recent years and has the potential to
offer an unvarnished view into the lives of residents using a
public forum that is open to the public and program
directors alike. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
publically available Facebook profiles of surgical residents to
determine the incidence and degree of unprofessional
conduct.
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons Web site
was used to identify general surgery residencies located in
the Midwest. Resident rosters were then obtained using
departmental Web sites. Facebook was then searched to
determine which residents had profiles available for viewing
by the public. The Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education’s components of professionalism and the
American Medical Association’s report on professionalism
in the use of social media were used to develop the following
3 categories: professional, potentially unprofessional, or
clearly unprofessional.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The chi-square test was used
to determine significance.
RESULTS: A total of 57 residency programs were identified
on the American College of Surgeons Web site, of which 40
(70.2%) provided an institutional Web site with a current
resident roster. A total of 996 surgical residents were
identified, of which 319 (32%) had identifiable Facebook
profiles. Overall, 235 residents (73.7%) had no unprofessional
content, 45 (14.1%) had potentially unprofessional content,
and 39 (12.2%) had clearly unprofessional content. Binge
drinking, sexually suggestive photos, and Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act violations were the most
commonly found variables in the clearly unprofessional group.
There were no statistical differences in professionalism based
on sex (p ¼ 0.93) or postgraduate year status (p ¼ 0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: Unprofessional behavior is prevalent
among surgical residents who use Facebook, and this
behavior does not appear to decrease as residents progress
through training. This represents a risk to the reputations of
hospitals and residency programs, and residents should be
educated on the dangers of social media. Although it may be
perceived as an invasion of privacy, this information is
publically available, and program directors may benefit from
monitoring these sites to identify gaps in professionalism
that require correction. ( J Surg 71:e28-e32. JC 2014

"Abstract
Proteomic studies were performed to identify proteins involved in the response of Oenothera glazioviana seedlings under Cu stress. Exposure of 28-d-old seedlings to 50 μM CuSO4 for 3 d led to inhibition of shoot and root growth as well as a considerable increase in the level of lipid peroxidation in the roots. Cu absorbed by O. glazioviana accumulated more easily in the root than in the shoot. Label-free proteomic analysis indicated 58 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) of the total 3,149 proteins in the roots of O. glazioviana seedlings, of which 36 were upregulated and 22 were downregulated under Cu stress conditions. Gene Ontology analysis showed that most of the identified proteins could be annotated to signal transduction, detoxification, stress defence, carbohydrate, energy, and protein metabolism, development, and oxidoreduction. We also retrieved 13 proteins from the enriched Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes and the protein-protein interaction databases related to various pathways, including the citric acid (CA) cycle. Application of exogenous CA to O. glazioviana seedlings exposed to Cu alleviated the stress symptoms. Overall, this study provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant response to Cu at the protein level in relation to soil properties.",1

Backgrounds
Evidence is scarce on the relation between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy and fetal growth in developing countries. Moreover, the current evidence is inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the association of trimester-specific exposure to air pollution with risk of being born small for gestational age (SGA) and birth weight-markers of fetal growth-among Chinese term births.
Methods
This retrospective population-based cohort study consisted of 2,567,457 singleton term live-births from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017 across 123 Chinese districts and counties. Personal exposure to ambient air pollutants including carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and PM10 was assigned using the inverse distance weighting spatial interpolation algorithm. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were performed to estimate the associations between trimester-specific exposure to air pollution and risk of SGA or low birth weight (LBW), and GEE linear regression to examine the associations between the exposure and term birth weight, adjusting for maternal demographics, maternal cigarette smoking status during pregnancy, mode of delivery, gravidity, gestational age, year and month of conception, neonate’s sex, and meteorological factors. Stratified and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
Results
When mother exposed to ambient air pollutants over the entire pregnancy, per IQR increment (0.122 mg/m3) in ambient CO concentrations was associated with higher risk of SGA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.05) and reduced birth weight among term births (−5.95 g, 95% CI: −8.01, −3.89). This association was also pronounced in the second and third trimesters. Term birth weight was negatively associated with per IQR increase of O3 (−3.52 g, 95% CI: −6.23, −0.81), PM2.5 (−5.93 g, 95% CI: −8.36, −3.49) and PM10 (−7.78 g, 95% CI: −10.41, −5.16) during the entire pregnancy, respectively. No significant association was detected between maternal exposure to air pollutants and term LBW. Effect estimates of heterogeneity suggested that maternal age and infant sex modified the impact of air pollution on birth weight.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is adversely affecting fetal growth. Further studies are warranted to integrate these findings and take clinical or public health interventions in pregnancy.",1
"Abstract
Human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) are restricted in proliferative capacity in vivo. Reduction in the number of hCEC leads to persistent corneal edema requiring corneal transplantation. This study demonstrates the functions of SIRT1 in hCECs and its potential for corneal endothelial regeneration. Cell morphology, cell growth rates and proliferation-associated proteins were compared in normal and senescent hCECs. SIRT1 was activated using the CRISPR/dCas9 activation system (SIRT1a). The plasmids were transfected into CECs of six-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats using electroporation and cryoinjury was performed. Senescent cells were larger, elongated and showed lower proliferation rates and lower SIRT1 levels. SIRT1 activation promoted the wound healing of CECs. In vivo transfection of SIRT1a promoted the regeneration of CECs. The proportion of the S-phase cells was lower in senescent cells and elevated upon SIRT1a activation. SIRT1 regulated cell proliferation, proliferation-associated proteins, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxidative stress levels. In conclusion, corneal endothelial senescence is related with a decreased SIRT1 level. SIRT1a promotes the regeneration of CECs by inhibiting cytokine-induced cell death and senescence. Gene function activation therapy using SIRT1a may serve as a novel treatment strategy for hCEC diseases.

Purpose
Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) with activity in HER2-amplified metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Its role in non–HER2-amplified MBC remains unclear. EGF30001, a phase III trial of lapatinib and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel and placebo, demonstrated lapatinib does not significantly benefit HER2-negative or HER2-unselected patients with MBC. Published data support interactions between steroid hormone and peptide growth factor signaling. We hypothesized that molecular subgroups may exist within EGF30001 that would benefit from lapatinib.
Methods
A blinded, retrospective biomarker evaluation was performed using immunohistochemistry to semiquantitate estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and EGFR expression. HER2 amplification was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Effects of these biomarkers on event-free survival (EFS) were examined in patients with available tissue (n = 493).
Results
Lapatinib improved median EFS in HER2-amplified, ER- or PR-positive MBC (n = 36; 5.7 v 4.5 months; P = .351); benefit was greater and statistically significant in HER2-amplified, ER-negative, PR-negative MBC (n = 42; 8.3 v 5.0 months; P = .007). In HER2-negative, ER-positive MBC, median EFS improvement varied by degree of PR expression (H-score): no benefit if PR-strong (n = 133; 9.3 v 7.3 months; P = .373), benefit if PR-weak (n = 50; 7.3 v 2.4 months; P = .026), and potential antagonism if PR-negative (n = 40; 3.7 v 7.2 months; P = .004). No benefit was seen in triple-negative MBC (n = 131; median EFS, 4.6 v 4.8 months; P = .255). EGFR expression was not correlated with benefit from lapatinib.
Conclusion
Although subgroups are small, these analyses support the hypothesis that semiquantitative determination of hormone receptor status may be a surrogate for EGFR and/or HER2 dependency.",1
"Abstract
Reductions in positive affect are a salient feature of preschool-onset major depressive disorder. Yet, little is known about the psychophysiological correlates of this blunted positive affect and whether reduced physiological responding to pleasant stimuli may differentiate depressed and healthy young children. 120 four-to-seven year old children with current depression and 63 psychiatrically healthy 4-to-7 year old children completed a simple picture-viewing task of pleasant and neutral pictures while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The early-childhood version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Depression was used to establish psychiatric diagnoses. A one-way ANCOVA was used to test for group differences in response to pleasant and neutral pictures. Young children with depression showed a reduced response to pleasant vs. neutral pictures (LPP), after controlling for children’s age. The LPP for the children with preschool-onset depression was significantly smaller than the LPP in the healthy group of young children. This difference did not vary as a function of depression or anhedonia severity within the group with depression or the healthy children. Similar to older children and adolescents with depression, young children with depression display reductions in responsivity to pleasant stimuli as indexed by the LPP. These findings extend prior findings indicating a blunted response to pleasant stimuli in preschool- onset depression. Given the greater neuroplasticity of emotional response and regulation, these findings suggest clinical attention to emotional response to pleasure is an important target in preschool-onset depression.

Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements always had a very poor prognosis. In this study, we report the incidence of MLL rearrangements in AML patients using gene analysis, as well as the clinical significance and prognostic features of these rearrangements.

Material/Methods
This retrospective study took place from April 2008 to November 2011 in the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital. A total 433 AML patients were screened by multiple nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the incidence of the 11 MLL gene rearrangements. There were 68 cases of MLL gene rearrangements, for a positive rate of 15.7%. A total of 24 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT), and 34 patients received at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Ten patients were lost to follow-up.

Results
The median follow-up was 29 months. The complete remission (CR) rate was 85.4%. The overall survival (OS) was 57.4±5.9 months for the Allo-HSCT group and 21.0±2.1 months for the chemotherapy group. The Allo-HSCT group had superior survival compared with the chemotherapy group (5-year OS: 59±17% vs. 13±8%, P<0.01; 5-year disease-free survival [DFS]: 65±10% vs. 40±16%, P>0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that transplantation, platelets >50×109/L at onset, and CR are associated with a better OS in MLL rearranged AML patients. Patients with thrombocytopenia and extramedullary involvement were prone to relapse.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that Allo-HSCT is superior to chemotherapy alone for treating MLL rearranged AML patients. Patients treated with Allo-HSCT have a better prognosis and a longer survival. CR is an independent prognostic factor for OS, and extramedullary involvement is an independent prognostic factor for DFS. MLL rearranged AML patients with thrombocytopenia at onset <50×109 had very bad OS and DFS.

"Abstract
During embryonic development, many organs form by extensive branching of epithelia through
the formation of clefts and buds. In cleft formation, buds are delineated by the conversion of
epithelial cell-cell adhesions to cell-matrix adhesions, but the mechanisms of cleft formation are
not clear. Here we identify Btbd7 as a dynamic regulator of branching morphogenesis. Btbd7
provides a mechanistic link between the extracellular matrix and cleft propagation through its
highly focal expression leading to local regulation of Snail2 (Slug), E-cadherin, and epithelial cell
motility. Inhibition experiments show that Btbd7 is required for branching of embryonic
mammalian salivary glands and lungs. Hence Btbd7 is a regulatory gene that promotes epithelial
tissue remodelling and formation of branched organs.",1
"Abstract
Date (da'te) City in Fukushima Prefecture has conducted a population-wide individual dose monitoring program after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident, which provides a unique and comprehensive data set of the individual doses of citizens. The purpose of this paper, the first in the series, is to establish a method for estimating effective doses based on the available ambient dose rate survey data. We thus examined the relationship between the individual external doses and the corresponding ambient doses assessed from airborne surveys. The results show that the individual doses were about 0.15 times the ambient doses, the coefficient of 0.15 being a factor of 4 smaller than the value employed by the Japanese government, throughout the period of the airborne surveys used. The method obtained in this study could aid in the prediction of individual doses in the early phase of future radiological accidents involving large-scale contamination.",1

Background: It is common today to encounter anxiety in patients facing dental treatment. Virtual reality (VR) is presented as a high-performing and innovative procedure because it can distract patients undergoing dental procedures or prepare them for such treatments. In addition, this meta-analysis has gathered evidence on VR and its ability to reduce dental anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing different treatments. Methods: The major Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched for scientific articles published up to 2023. Studies in which VR was used for children and adults as a measure against anxiety during dental treatments were included. VR was defined as a three-dimensional place where patients experience a sense of immersion as they find themselves in attractive and interactive environments that detach them from reality. Anxiety and pain were examined and measured during dental treatments in which VR was used by comparing them with standard care situations. Results: Twenty-five studies were identified, of which eleven met the inclusion criteria. The effect of VR was studied mainly in the pediatric population as a distractive method. Only two studies (not significant) on an adult population were considered. Conclusions: this review shows that VR is an excellent distraction method that is effective in reducing anxiety before dental treatment; however, due to the few studies in this area, further research on VR as a tool to prepare patients for dental treatment is needed.

"Over the past 5 years, the increase in the number of studies
examining resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has
been nothing short of astonishing. This upsurge is fueled
by the fundamental insights such studies provide regarding the
organization of neural circuitry in health and disease and the fact
that the technique is relatively easy to use. In concert with other
techniques used to assess connectivity, the RSFC literature has
shifted the field’s approach to pathophysiology, such that
investigators now focus less on functioning within individual
brain regions and more on the ways in which these regions
interact to function as part of an integrated circuit",1
"Abstract
Perceptual learning serves as a mechanism for listeners to adapt to novel phonetic information. Distributional tracking theories posit that this adaptation occurs as a result of listeners accumulating talker-specific distributional information about the phonetic category in question (Kleinschmidt & Jaeger, Psychological Review, 122, 148–203, 2015). What is not known is how listeners build these talker-specific distributions—that is, if they aggregate all information received over a certain time period, or if they rely more heavily upon the most recent information received and down-weight older, consolidated information. In the present experiment, listeners were exposed to four interleaved blocks of a lexical decision task and a phonetic categorization task in which the lexical decision blocks were designed to bias perception in opposite directions of a “s”–“sh” contrast. Listeners returned several days later and completed the identical task again. In each individual session, listener’s perception of a “s”–“sh” contrast was biased by the information in the immediately preceding lexical decision block (though only when participants heard the “sh”-biasing block first, which was likely driven by stimulus characteristics). There was evidence that listeners accrued information about the talker over time since the bias effect diminished in the second session. In general, results suggest that listeners initially maintain some flexibility with their talker-specific phonetic representations, but over the course of several exposures begin to consolidate these representations.",1
"Abstract
OBJECTIVE. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) computed from standard coronary CT scans (FFRCT) is a novel noninvasive method for determining the functional significance of coronary artery lesions. Compared with CT alone, FFRCT significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and discrimination for patients with and without hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses. To date, the impact of CT image quality on diagnostic performance of FFRCT is unknown. We evaluated the impact of patient preparation, CT scan protocol, and factors related to image quality on the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We studied stable patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), enrolled from 17 centers, who underwent CT, invasive coronary angiography, FFR, and FFRCT. The accuracy of CT and FFRCT for diagnosis of ischemia was compared against an invasive FFR reference standard. Anatomically obstructive CAD was defined by a stenosis value of at least 50 by CT or invasive coronary angiography, whereas ischemia was defined by an FFR or FFRCT of up to 0.80. Ischemia was assessed at the per-patient and per-vessel levels. Diagnostic performance of FFRCT was then evaluated in relation to patient preparation, including administration before CT of a β-blocker or nitroglycerin, as well as in relation to imaging characteristics, including misalignment, noise, motion, and coronary artery calcium.
RESULTS. Among 252 study participants, 137 (54.0%) had an abnormal FFR. Administration of a β-blocker increased FFRCT specificity (51.0% vs 66.0%; p = 0.03) with lower bias (–0.084 vs −0.048; p = 0.008), whereas nitroglycerin pretreatment within 30 minutes of CT was associated with improved specificity (54.0% vs 75.0%; p = 0.013). Misalignment artifacts resulted in impaired sensitivity (43.0% vs 86.0%; p = 0.001) with resultant reductions in overall accuracy (56.0% vs 71.0%; p = 0.03). No differences in diagnostic performance of FFRCT were noted in the presence of coronary motion or increasing coronary artery calcium score.
CONCLUSION. Use of β-blockade and nitroglycerin administration before CT improve diagnostic performance of FFRCT. Diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT is significantly reduced in the setting of misalignment artifacts.",1
"Abstract
Mandibular mobility accompanying gape change in Northern and Antarctic minke whales was investigated by manipulating jaws of carcasses, recording jaw movements via digital instruments (inclinometers, accelerometers, and goniometers), and examining osteological and soft tissue movements via computed tomography (CT)-scans. We investigated longitudinal (α) rotation of the mandible and mediolateral displacement at the symphysis (Ω1) and temporomandibular joint (Ω2) as the mouth opened (Δ). Results indicated three phases of jaw opening. In the first phase, as gape increased from zero to 8°, there was slight (<1°) α and Ω rotation. As gape increased between 20 and 30°, the mandibles rotated slightly laterally (Mean 3°), the posterior condyles were slightly medially displaced (Mean 4°), and the anterior ends at the symphysis were laterally displaced (Mean 3°). In the third phase of jaw opening, from 30° to full (≥90°) gape, these motions reversed: mandibles rotated medially (Mean 29°), condyles were laterally displaced (Mean 14°), and symphyseal ends were medially displaced (Mean 1°). Movements were observed during jaw manipulation and analyzed with CT-images that confirmed quantitative inclinometer/accelerometer data, including the unstable intermediate (Phase 2) position. Together these shifting movements maintain a constant distance for adductor muscles stretched between the skull's temporal fossa and mandible's coronoid process. Mandibular rotation enlarges the buccal cavity's volume as much as 36%, likely to improve prey capture in rorqual lunge feeding; it may strengthen and stabilize jaw opening or closure, perhaps via a simple locking or unlocking mechanism. Rotated lips may brace baleen racks during filtration. Mandibular movements may serve a proprioceptive mechanosensory function, perhaps via the symphyseal organ, to guide prey engulfment and water expulsion for filtration.

"Abstract
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine application to the umbilical cord in neonates. We searched MEDLINE and other electronic databases, and included all RCTs that evaluated the effect of single or multiple chlorhexidine cord applications on the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and/or the incidence of systemic sepsis and omphalitis. A total of six RCTs—four community-based cluster RCTs and two hospital-based trials—were included in the review. Of the four cluster RCTs, three were conducted in South Asia in settings with high rates of home births (>92%) while the fourth, available only as an abstract, was conducted in Africa. Pooled analysis by the ‘intention-to-treat’ principle showed a significant reduction in NMR after chlorhexidine application (four studies; relative risk (RR) 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.95; fixed effects (FE) model). On subgroup analysis, only multiple applications showed a significant effect (four studies; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99) whereas a single application did not (one study; RR 0.86; 0.73 to 1.02). Similarly, only the community-based trials showed a significant reduction in NMR (three studies; RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95), while the hospital-based study did not find any effect (RR 0.11; 0.01 to 2.03). Since all the studies were conducted in high-NMR settings (⩾30 per 1000 live births), we could not determine the effect in settings with low NMRs. Only one study—a hospital-based trial from India—reported the incidence of neonatal sepsis; it did not find a significant reduction in any sepsis (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.28). Pooled analysis of community-based studies revealed significant reduction in the risk of omphalitis in infants who received the intervention (four studies; RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81). The hospital-based trial had no instances of omphalitis in either of the two groups. Chlorhexidine application delayed the time to cord separation (four studies; mean difference 2.11 days; 95% CI 2.07 to 2.15; FE model). Chlorhexidine application to the cord reduces the risk of neonatal mortality and omphalitis in infants born at home in high-NMR settings. Routine chlorhexidine application, preferably daily for 7 to 10 days after birth, should therefore be recommended in these infants. Given the paucity of evidence, there is presently no justification for recommending this intervention in infants born in health facilities and/or low-NMR settings.",1
"OBJECTIVES
Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) and paravertebral block (PVB) are well known to reduce pain levels after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). However, the relative efficacies of each block and a combination of the 2 have not been fully characterized. The objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of PVB alone, SAPB alone and the combination of PVB and SAPB with regard to the occurrence and intensity of pain after VATS.

METHODS
We conducted the THORACOSOPIC single-centre, double-blind, randomized trial in adult patients due to undergo elective VATS lung resection. The participants were randomized to PVB only, SAPB only and PVB + SAPB groups. The primary end-point was pain on coughing on admission to the postanaesthesia care unit. The secondary end-points were postoperative pain at rest and on coughing at other time points and the cumulative opioid consumption. Pain was scored on a visual analogue scale.

RESULTS
One-hundred and fifty-six patients (52 in each group) were included. On admission to the postanaesthesia care unit, the 3 groups did not differ significantly with regard to the pain on coughing: the visual analogue scale score was 3 (0–6), 4 (0–8) and 2 (0–6) in the PVB, SAPB and PVB + SAPB groups, respectively (P = 0.204). During postoperative care, the overall pain score was significantly lower in the SABP + PVP group at rest and on cough.

CONCLUSIONS
The combination of SABP + PVB could be beneficial for pain management in VATS in comparison to SABP or PVB alone.",1
"Background: Ischemic stroke is clearly affected by microRNAs (miRNAs) due to dys- function of their regulatory networks. Our clinical data confirmed decreased miR- 221 levels in plasma collected from patients with acute ischemia compared with plasma from healthy controls. Therefore, we further aimed to demonstrate the regu- latory mechanisms by which miR-221 exerts its neuroprotective effects in acute ischemic brain injury. Methods: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to establish focal cerebral ischemia in adult male C57BL/6 mice. A miR-221 mimic or a negative mimic control was injected by intracerebroventricular administration 24 h prior to MCAO. After 48 h, cerebral infarction volume and neurological scores were calculated, and to determine the extent of neuroprotection by miR-221, neuro- behavioral tests were performed. Quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry were also performed to identify the expression of inflammation-related cytokines and chemokines as well as infiltration/activation of various immune cells in the brain. Results: The results showed that MCAO mice treated with a miR-221 mimic exhibited significantly decreased cerebral infarction volume and increased amelioration of behavioral deficits. Moreover, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, MCP-1, VCAM-1, and IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) was significantly decreased in the miR-221 mimic-treated group. In addition, the flow cytometry data showed that macrophage infiltration and microglial activation were blocked by miR-221 treatment. Conclusion: our results indicate that miR-221 could decrease brain damage in the setting of acute ischemic stroke by inhibiting the proinflammatory response, which furthered our understanding of the molecular basis of miR-221 and provided a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic stroke .

"Abstract
Activated cell surface and intracellular receptors lead to insulin resistance in obesity. Among these receptors, triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1, toll like receptors (TLRs), and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) play a significant role in the induction of inflammatory response in innate immunity. TREM-1 potentially amplifies TLRs and RAGE synergistically with DNA-binding high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1). The objective of the study was to analyze the association between TREM-1/DAP12 and HMGB-1, RAGE and TLRs in obesity-induced insulin resistance. We examined the mRNA expression by RT-PCR and protein expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence for TREM-1, TREM-2, DAP-12, HMGB-1, RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2 in omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsy tissues of obese diabetic (n=22) and non-diabetic subjects (n=24) and compared with the non-obese non-diabetic controls (n=5). There was a significantly increased expression of TREM-1, DAP-12, HMGB-1, RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2 and decreased expression of TREM-2 in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsy of obese diabetic subjects compared to obese non-diabetics and the non-obese population. Overall, obese diabetic subjects had high expression of TREM-1 in association with HMGB1 (100% vs 58.3%, P=0.003), RAGE (77.3% vs 41.7%, P=0.045), TLR4 (100% vs 58.3%, P=0.003), and TLR2 (100% vs 50%, P=0.003) in liver biopsy samples in comparison to obese non-diabetic subjects. Obese diabetics have significantly increased TREM-1, HMGB1, RAGE, and TLRs compared to obese non-diabetics. Our findings suggest a potential pathophysiological role of TREM-1 in conjunction with HMGB1 and inflammatory cell receptors (RAGE, TLR-4 and TLR-2) in obesity-induced insulin resistance.

"Abstract
Trehalose is a stable disaccharide commonly found in nature, from bacteria to fungi and plants. For the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, claims that trehalose is a stress protectant were based indirectly either on correlation between accumulation of trehalose and high resistance to various stresses or on stress hypersensitivity of mutants deleted for TPS1, which encodes the first enzyme in trehalose biosynthetic pathway. Our goal was to investigate more directly which one, between trehalose and/or the Tps1 protein, may serve yeast cells to withstand exposure to stress. By employing an original strategy that combined the use of mutant strains expressing catalytically inactive variants of Tps1, with MAL+ yeast strains able to accumulate trehalose from an exogenous supply, we bring for the first time unbiased proof that trehalose does not protect yeast cells from dying and that the stress-protecting role of trehalose in this eukaryotic model was largely overestimated. Conversely, we identified the Tps1 protein as a key player for yeast survival in response to temperature, oxidative, and desiccation stress. We also showed by robust RT-quantitative PCR and genetic interaction analysis that the role of Tps1 in thermotolerance is not dependent upon Hsf1-dependent transcription activity. Finally, our results revealed that the Tps1 protein is essential to maintain ATP levels during heat shock. Altogether, these findings supported the idea that Tps1 is endowed with a regulatory function in energy homeostasis, which is essential to withstand adverse conditions and maintain cellular integrity.",1
"Abstract
Energy has become an essential part of today’s lifestyle, especially for using the electronic appliances in homes, offices and
other built environments in a daily basis. Although in modern life, electronic devices have become ubiquitous, the excessive
electromagnetic radiations from these appliances may cause potential health effects. Realizing this significance, a systemic
and comprehensive assessment was performed to study the radiation propagation generating from the energy based electric
appliances. Along with measuring the radiation exposure in buildings, this study examined how the radiation propagation varies
with different construction materials. Moreover, radiation associated human health impacts were also investigated. Evaluation of
five building environment demonstrated that drywall acted as the best shielding object (transmission coefficient: 18% electric
field strength) whereas lumber and glass wall acted as the poor shielding material (96% and 97% electric field strength
respectively). Comparison with the standard values specified by international authorities showed lower field strength values for
some regulatory institute, although these values were higher compared to some more restricted safety levels in some countries,
indicating the possible human health impacts in the assessed built environment. Hence, this study recommends utilization of
proper shielding materials, maintaining exposure distance along with exposure duration reduction.

Background
Although previous studies have shown that aerobic and resistance exercise increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the optimal type of exercise has not been determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association of jogging (a type of aerobic exercise) and weight training (a type of resistance exercise) with HDL-C levels in Taiwanese adults.

Methods
The data used in this cross-sectional study were obtained from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), which is a national health resource that contains the genetic information of Taiwanese volunteers aged 30–70 years. A total of 75,635 subjects (47,881 women and 27,754 men) were included in this study. The subjects were divided into four groups: jogging (n = 2,278), weight training (n = 522), mixed exercise (n = 519), and no exercise (n = 72,316). The TWB data were collected through questionnaires (e.g. basic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and disease history), biochemical tests, and anthropometric measurements.

Results
Compared with no exercise, jogging, weight training, and mixed exercise were all associated with higher HDL-C levels (β = 2.5470, 2.6249, and 3.2117, respectively). As seen, the β value was highest for the mixed exercise group, followed by weight training and then jogging (p for trend <0.0001).

Conclusions
In the current study, jogging and weight training were individually associated with higher levels of HDL-C. Engaging in both activities was associated with much higher levels of HDL-C. Our findings suggest that regular jogging and weight training might play an important role in increasing HDL-C levels.

"Variability in transplant access exists, but barriers to referral and evaluation are underexplored due to lack of national surveillance data. We examined referral for kidney transplantation evaluation and start of the evaluation among 34 857 incident, adult (18-79 years) end-stage kidney disease patients from 690 dialysis facilities in the United States Renal Data System from January 1, 2012 through August 31, 2016, followed through February 2018 and linked data to referral and evaluation data from nine transplant centers in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Multivariable-adjusted competing risk analysis examined each outcome. The median within-facility cumulative percentage of patients referred for kidney transplantation within 1 year of dialysis at the 690 dialysis facilities in Network 6 was 33.7% (interquartile range [IQR]: 25.3%-43.1%). Only 48.3% of referred patients started the transplant evaluation within 6 months of referral. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with referral vs evaluation start among those referred at any time differed. For example, black, non-Hispanic patients had a higher rate of referral (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-1.27), but lower evaluation start among those referred (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88-0.98), vs white non-Hispanic patients. Barriers to transplant varied by step, and national surveillance data should be collected on early transplant steps to improve transplant access.",1
"Abstract
Purpose:
The magnetic fields of linac-MR systems modify the path of contaminant electrons in photon beams, which alters patient skin dose. To accurately quantify the magnitude of changes in skin dose, the authors use Monte Carlo calculations that incorporate realistic 3D magnetic field models of longitudinal and transverse linac-MR systems.

Methods:
Finite element method (FEM) is used to generate complete 3D magnetic field maps for 0.56 T longitudinal and transverse linac-MR magnet assemblies, as well as for representative 0.5 and 1.0 T Helmholtz MRI systems. EGSnrc simulations implementing these 3D magnetic fields are performed. The geometry for the BEAMnrc simulations incorporates the Varian 600C 6 MV linac, magnet poles, the yoke, and the magnetic shields of the linac-MRIs. Resulting phase-space files are used to calculate the central axis percent depth-doses in a water phantom and 2D skin dose distributions for 70μm entrance and exit layers using DOSXYZnrc. For comparison, skin doses are also calculated in the absence of magnetic field, and using a 1D magnetic field with an unrealistically large fringe field. The effects of photon field size, air gap (longitudinal configuration), and angle of obliquity (transverse configuration) are also investigated.

Results:
Realistic modeling of the 3D magnetic fields shows that fringe fields decay rapidly and have a very small magnitude at the linac head. As a result, longitudinal linac-MR systems mostly confine contaminant electrons that are generated in the air gap and have an insignificant effect on electrons produced further upstream. The increase in the skin dose for the longitudinal configuration compared to the zeroB-field case varies from ∼1% to ∼14% for air gaps of 5–31 cm, respectively. (All dose changes are reported as a % of Dmax.) The increase is also field-size dependent, ranging from ∼3% at 20 × 20 cm2 to ∼11% at 5 × 5 cm2. The small changes in skin dose are in contrast to significant increases that are calculated for the unrealistic 1D magnetic field. For the transverse configuration, the entrance skin dose is equal or smaller than that of the zero B-field case for perpendicular beams. For a 10 × 10 cm2 oblique beam the transverse magnetic field decreases the entry skin dose for oblique angles less than ±20° and increases it by no more than 10% for larger angles up to ±45°. The exit skin dose is increased by 42% for a 10 × 10 cm2 perpendicular beam, but appreciably drops and approaches the zero B-field case for large oblique angles of incidence.

Conclusions:
For longitudinal linac-MR systems only a small increase in the entrance skin dose is predicted, due to the rapid decay of the realistic magnetic fringe fields. For transverse linac-MR systems, changes to the entrance skin dose are small for most scenarios. For the same geometry, on the exit side a fairly large increase is observed for perpendicular beams, but significantly drops for large oblique angles of incidence. The observed effects on skin dose are not expected to limit the application of linac-MR systems in either the longitudinal or transverse configuration.",1

surgery in Sweden.
SETTING: Swedish National Cataract Register containing reports on cataract operations from all
Swedish ophthalmic surgical units.
DESIGN: Prospective epidemiologic study.
METHODS: Endophthalmitis case reports were collected from 2005 through 2010. Case and control
parameters pertaining to patient characteristics and surgical technique were generated from the database. In addition, information from annual surveys regarding the topical prophylactic protocol
was analyzed.
RESULTS: The reports showed 135 endophthalmitis cases in 464 996 operations, equaling an incidence of 0.029%. Patient age over 85 years, perioperative communication with the vitreous and,
above all, nonuse of intracameral cefuroxime showed a statistically significant association with
endophthalmitis in the logistic regression. Short-term topical antibiotics given as add-on
prophylaxis to the intracameral regimen before, after, or before and after the operation did not
confer a clear-cut benefit. Groups with topical treatment were small, comprising 14% of the
sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in Sweden is declining,
which appears to be explained by a fall in the frequency of major risk factors. Operating earlier in
the cataract course, avoiding capsule breakage, and giving intracameral antibiotics universally
should further reduce the endophthalmitis rate.

"Abstract
Objective:
Betahistine is frequently used in the pharmacotherapy for Menière’s Disease (MD). Little is known about its mode of action and prescribed dosages vary. While betahistine had an increasing effect on cochlear microcirculation in earlier studies, low dose betahistine of 0.01 mg/kg bw or less was not able to effect this. Selegiline inhibits monoaminooxidase B and therefore potentially the breakdown of betahistine. The goal of this study was to examine whether the addition of selegiline to low dose betahistine leads to increased cochlear blood flow.
Methods:
Twelve Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were anesthetized, the cochlea was exposed and a window opened to the stria vascularis. Blood plasma was visualized by injecting fluoresceinisothiocyanate-dextrane and vessel diameter and erythrocyte velocity were evaluated over 20 minutes. One group received low dose betahistine (0.01 mg/kg bw) and selegiline (1 mg/kg bw) i.v. while the other group received only selegiline (1 mg/kg bw) and saline (0.9% NaCl) as placebo i.v.
Results:
Cochlear microcirculation increased significantly (P < .001) in guinea pigs treated with low dose betahistine combined with selegiline by up to 58.3 ± 38.7% above baseline over a period of up to 11 minutes. In one guinea pig, the increase was 104.6%. Treatment with Selegiline alone did not affect microcirculation significantly.
Conclusions:
Low dose betahistine increased cochlear microcirculation significantly when combined with selegiline. This should be investigated in further studies regarding dose-effect relation in comparison to betahistine alone. Side effects, in particular regarding circulation, should be considered carefully in view of the clinical applicability of a combination therapy in patients with MD.",1
"Complexity algorithms provide information about datasets which is radically diferent from classical moment

Background
Sensory disturbances in fibromyalgia extend beyond nociception. It has been proposed that imbalance in the mutual competition between painful input and non-painful sensory activity may, to a significant extent, account for the augmented subjective perception of pain. In this context, non-nociceptive somatosensory stimulation could arguably attenuate fibromyalgia symptoms by restoring the sensory balance. We specifically tested the effect of vibrotactile stimulation on symptom relief in fibromyalgia patients with a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial.

Methods
Seventy-seven female patients were randomized and data from 63 valid cases were analyzed. Active intervention involved extensive body stimulation with gentle mechanical vibrations administered during 3 h at night for 3 weeks, and the placebo effect was controlled using identical instruments to simulate an alternative treatment option. The primary outcome measure combined pain, fatigue, and complaints of poor cognition.

Results
Vibrotactile stimulation was significantly superior to sham in alleviating fibromyalgia symptoms globally. However, univariate analyses showed that the effect was not universal. Benefits were perceived on unpleasant somatic sensations such as generalized pain and fatigue, but not on poor cognition, anxiety, and depression. Vibrotactile stimulation was notably well tolerated and sleep quality significantly improved despite the fact that vibrations were administered at night.

Conclusions
Results thus provide new evidence that non-nociceptive somatosensory stimulation may favorably act upon altered somatosensory balance in fibromyalgia. From a clinical perspective, both the degree of improvement and the easy application of our proposal would seem to support a potential role for vibrotactile stimulation in the symptomatic treatment of fibromyalgia.",1

"Background: At present, laboratory blood tests to support major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis are not available. This study aimed to screen potential mRNAs for peripheral blood biomarkers and novel pathophysiology of MDD.

Methods: The present study utilized public data from two mRNA microarray datasets to analyze the hub genes changes related to MDD. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed. Finally, some potential mRNA quality biomarkers for hub gene expression in blood were identified.

Results: A total of 25 significantly co-upregulated DEGs and 98 co-downregulated DEGs were obtained from two datasets. The pathway enrichment analyses showed that co-upregulated genes were significantly enriched in the regulation of cell-matrix adhesion and mitochondrial membrane permeability which were involved in the apoptotic process. Co-downregulated genes were mainly involved in the neutrophil activation which in turn was involved in the immune response, degranulation and cell-mediated immunity, positive regulation of immune response, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. From the PPI network, 14 hub genes were obtained. Among them, the subnetworks of PLCG1, BCL2A1, TLR8, FADD, and TLR4 screened out from our study have been shown to play a role in immune and inflammation responses.

Discussion: The potential molecular mechanisms that have been identified simultaneously include innate immunity, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic factors for synapse function and development.

"Abstract
Caffeine’s ergogenic effects persist during various exercise modalities; however, information establishing its efficacy during CrossFit® protocols is limited. This study aimed to determine the effects of caffeine supplementation on CrossFit® performance. Twenty CrossFit®-trained men (age = 26.7 ± 6.2 years, experience = 3.7 ± 2.9 years) were randomized in a double-blind, crossover design. Participants completed two sessions separated by a seven-day washout period, 60 min after consuming 5 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo. In each session, participants completed as many rounds as possible in 20 min of five pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. CrossFit® performance was the total number of repetitions completed in 20 min. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare CrossFit® performance between caffeine and placebo conditions and to test for a potential learning effect between the first and second sessions. CrossFit® performance was not significantly different during the caffeine condition compared to the placebo (468.6 ± 114.7 vs. 466.7 ± 94.3 repetitions, p = 0.861). A significant learning effect was identified between the first and second sessions (452.4 ± 101 vs. 483.8 ± 106.5 repetitions, p = 0.001), with no significant effect of treatment order (p = 0.438). Caffeine’s ergogenic effect were not present during the CrossFit® workout “Cindy”; however, future research should include familiarization sessions and examine other CrossFit® workouts in novice and women participants.

"Abstract
The crash risk of drivers increases significantly while driving under the influence of alcohol. However, the drivers' intention to drink and drive has not been explored yet in the context of a developing country like India. The present study applied an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to investigate the psychosocial predictors of drunk driving intentions of Indian drivers. 252 drivers participated in a self-reported survey designed for the study. Apart from the standard TPB components (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control), the survey also captured the extension measures such as risk perceptions, moral norms, traffic fatalism, sensation-seeking, conformity tendency, past engagement in drunk driving, crash history and driver demographics. The standard TPB model was successful in explaining 68.6% of the variance in the intention to drink and drive. The attitudes displayed the strongest influence on the intention (β = 0.696, p < 0.001), followed by perceived behavioural control (β = 0.180, p < 0.001); whereas subjective norms showed a moderate significance in influencing the intention (β = 0.062, p < 0.1). Among the extension variables, past behaviour showed the strongest influence on the intention to drink and drive (β = 0.123, p < 0.05), followed by sensation-seeking (β = 0.080, p < 0.05) and traffic fatalism (β = 0.072, p < 0.1). The extended TPB model explained 72% of the variance in the intention to drink and drive. The study findings can assist in the development of strategies/interventions to reduce drunk driving incidences.

"Abstract
Rodent acinar cells exhibit a remarkable plasticity as they can transdifferentiate to duct-, hepatocyte- and islet β-like cells. We evaluated whether exocrine cells from adult human pancreas can similarly respond to proendocrine stimuli. Exocrine cells from adult human pancreas were transduced directly with lentiviruses expressing activated MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and cultured as monolayers or as 3D structures. Expression of STAT3 and MAPK in human exocrine cells activated expression of the proendocrine factor neurogenin 3 in 50% to 80% of transduced exocrine cells. However, the number of insulin-positive cells increased only in the exocrine cells grown initially in suspension before 3D culture. Lineage tracing identified human acinar cells as the source of Ngn3- and insulin-expressing cells. Long-term engraftment into immunocompromised mice increased the efficiency of reprogramming to insulin-positive cells. Our data demonstrate that exocrine cells from human pancreas can be reprogrammed to transplantable insulin-producing cells that acquire functionality. Given the large number of exocrine cells in a donor pancreas, this approach presents a novel strategy to expand cell therapy in type 1 diabetes.",1
"CREB-target genetranscription during neuronal excitation is importantfor many aspects of neuronal development andfunction, including dendrite morphogenesis. However, the signaling events that regulate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated
gene transcription during dendritic development are not well understood. Herein we report that the CREB coactivator TORC1 (transducer of regulated CREB 1) is required for activity-dependent CREB-target gene expression and dendrite growth in developing cortical
neurons. Ca 2_x0001_ influx via voltage-gated calcium channels induced TORC1 dephosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus in a
calcineurin-dependent manner. Nuclear accumulation of TORC1 initiated the expression of CREB-target genes, including salt-inducible
kinase 1 (SIK1). In response of persistent depolarization, de novo SIK1 protein inturn promoted TORC1 phosphorylation and consequent
depletion of nucleus-localized TORC1. SIK1 induction thus appears to act as a negative feedback signal that prevents persistent CREB/
TORC1-dependent transcription in the face of long-lasting neuronal activity. Overexpressing wild type TORC1 promoted basal as well as
activity-induced dendritic growth, whereas expressing a dominant-negativeform of TORC1 or downregulating TORC1 inhibited activitydependent dendritic growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggest that neuronal activity-dependent dendritic growth in
developing cortical neurons relies on transient TORC1-mediated CREB-target gene transcription.",1

Background
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that causes significant public health problems in tropical countries. Schistosoma haematobium species are blamable for causing urinary schistosomiasis. The infected person, specifically children, may be carrying the disease. This systematic review aimed to identify the current knowledge of urinary Schistosmiasis in children or USC on its epidemiology, risk factors, and challenges to spread the understanding of controlling the disease and reducing the complications.

Method
In November 2021, a systematic computer-aided literature review was conducted using PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The results were updated in February 2022. We only used papers that have at least the abstract available in English. Relevant articles were screened, duplicates were deleted, eligibility criteria were applied, and studies that met the criteria were reviewed. The keywords Human Schistosoma infections, prevalence, risk factors and challenges were included. The protocol for the review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022311609). Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using the programme R version 4.2.1. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and p-value. A narrative approach was used to describe risk factors and challenges. Studies were selected and finalised based on the review question to prioritise. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed-Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT).

Results
A total of 248 publications met the requirements for inclusion. Fifteen articles were included in this review, with the result showing high heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in children is 4% (95% confidence interval (CI)). Age, poor socioeconomic status, education, exposure to river water, and poor sanitation are the risk factors identified in this review. Challenges are faced due to limitations of clean water, lack of water resources, and poor hygiene.

Conclusion
Modifiable risk factors such as poor knowledge and practices must be addressed immediately. Healthcare providers and schools could accomplish engaging in practical promotional activities. Communicating the intended messages to raise community awareness of urinary schistosomiasis is critical.

"The extremely poor prognosis of patients affected by glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV glioma) prompts the search for new and more effective therapies. In this regard, drug repurposing or repositioning can represent a safe, swift, and inexpensive way to bring novel pharmacological approaches from bench to bedside. Chlorpromazine, a medication used since six decades for the therapy of psychiatric disorders, shows in vitro several features that make it eligible for repositioning in cancer therapy. Using six GBM cell lines, three of which growing as patient-derived neurospheres and displaying stem-like properties, we found that chlorpromazine was able to inhibit viability in an apoptosis-independent way, induce hyperdiploidy, reduce cloning efficiency as well as neurosphere formation and downregulate the expression of stemness genes in all these cell lines. Notably, chlorpromazine synergized with temozolomide, the first-line therapeutic in GBM patients, in hindering GBM cell viability, and both drugs strongly cooperated in reducing cloning efficiency and inducing cell death in vitro for all the GBM cell lines assayed. These results prompted us to start a Phase II clinical trial on GBM patients (EudraCT # 2019-001988-75; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04224441) by adding chlorpromazine to temozolomide in the adjuvant phase of the standard first-line therapeutic protocol.",1

Background
Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is the most frequent repetitive fever syndrome in childhood. It is characterized by fever episodes lasting for approximately 3–6 days, once every 3–8 weeks.

Methods
Clinical and laboratory data for PFAPA syndrome patients between January 2010 and December 2014 followed up at a tertiary pediatric care hospital were reviewed.

Results
Four hundred children (256 male, 144 female; mean age at diagnosis, 4.2 ± 2.2 years), were enrolled in the study. During the episodes, mean leukocyte number was high (12 725/mm3) with predominant neutrophils. The mean number of monocytes was 1256/mm3, and 90.2% had monocytosis. Serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein were high in 84.6% and in 77.8% of the patients, respectively. Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene heterozygous mutation was identified in 57 of the 231 patients (24.7%) in whom genetic analysis had been performed. The most frequent mutation was heterozygous M694V (10%, n = 23). Extension of between-episode interval following prophylaxis was noted in 85% of those on regular colchicine treatment (n = 303). In the colchicine group, between-episode interval was prolonged from 18.8 ± 7.9 days (before colchicine treatment) to 49.5 ± 17.6 days on prophylactic colchicine therapy; also, prophylactic treatment was more effective in reducing episode frequency in patients with MEFV gene variant (n = 54, 96%) than in those without (n = 122, 80%; P = 0.003).

Conclusions
This study has involved the largest number of PFAPA syndrome patients in the literature. It is particularly important to assess and to demonstrate the high rate of response to colchicine prophylaxis in PFAPA syndrome patients, especially those with MEFV variant. On blood screening, neutrophilia associated with monocytosis and low procalcitonin could contribute to diagnosis.",1

Background
The optimal surgical technique for treating tibial plateau fractures remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of arthroscopy-assisted reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) to those of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in treating tibial plateau fractures.

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare surgical outcomes between ARIF versus ORIF for patients with tibial plateau fractures. Relevant studies, comprising randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, were identified through searches in Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase databases. Risk of bias assessments were conducted using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs (RoB 2.0), Newcastle Ottawa scales for non-RCTs, and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for case series studies. Data synthesis utilized a random-effects model meta-analysis. The primary outcome assessed was functional outcomes, with complications considered as secondary outcomes.

Results
There were fifteen studies (one RCT and fourteen non-RCTs) included in this study, comprising a total of 969 participants (548 in the ARIF group and 421 in the ORIF group). Although patients in the ARIF group showed a trend towards better functional outcomes compared to the ORIF group, the difference was not statistically significant (Hospital for special surgery score, mean difference (MD) = 5.13, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-1.67 to 11.92, I²=83%; Knee society score, MD = 5.84, 95% CI=-1.18 to 12.86, I²=74%). No significant differences were noted in infection, stiffness, DVT, and overall complications between two groups. The ARIF group included ten case series studies with a total of 302 patients. The pooled mean Rasmussen Radiological Score was 16.59 (95% CI, 15.72 to 17.50), and the pooled mean Rasmussen Clinical Score was 27.38 (95% CI, 26.45 to 28.33).

Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal no significant difference in clinical outcomes and complication rates between ARIF and ORIF. Additionally, this study found that the complication rate for patients undergoing ARIF falls within previously reported ranges. This suggests that ARIF is a reliable and effective surgical option for treating tibial plateau fractures, even in cases involving high-energy trauma.

"Abstract
Objective—Although studies have found that youth exposed to violence are more likely to carry
guns than non-exposed youth, this association could be due to common causal factors or other preexisting differences between individuals. In this study, within-individual change models were used
to determine whether juvenile offenders exhibit an increased propensity to carry a firearm after
being exposed to gun violence and/or non-gun violence. The advantage of this approach is all
time-invariant factors are eliminated as potential confounders.
Method—1170 racially/ethnically diverse male juvenile offenders were recruited in Arizona and
Pennsylvania (ages 14–19 at recruitment). Participants were interviewed every six months for
three years followed by four annual assessments. The outcome was gun carrying and the primary
predictors were exposure to gun violence and non-gun violence. Time-varying covariates included
exposure to peers who carried guns, exposure to peers who engaged in other (non-gun) criminal
acts, developmental changes in gun carrying, and changes in gun carrying due to incarceration/
institutionalization.

Results—Adolescent offenders were significantly more likely to carry a gun in recall periods
following exposure to gun violence, but not after exposure to non-gun violence. Effect of gun
violence on carrying was significant throughout adolescence and young adulthood, and could not
be accounted for by time-varying and time-invariant confounders.
Conclusions—Interventions to reduce illegal gun carrying should target young men in medical
and mental health settings who experience or witness gun violence, as well as those living in
communities with high rates of gun violence.

Background
Past research suggests that low testosterone levels relate to poorer cognitive function and higher Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk; however, these findings are inconsistent and are mostly derived from male samples, despite similar age-related testosterone decline in females. Both animal and human studies demonstrate that testosterone’s effects on brain health may be moderated by apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE-ε4) carrier status, which may explain some previous inconsistencies. We examined how testosterone relates to cognitive function in older women versus men across healthy aging and the AD continuum and the moderating role of APOE-ε4 genotype.

Methods
Five hundred and sixty one participants aged 55–90 (155 cognitively normal (CN), 294 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 112 AD dementia) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), who had baseline cognitive and plasma testosterone data, as measured by the Rules Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel were included. There were 213 females and 348 males (self-reported sex assigned at birth), and 52% of the overall sample were APOE-ε4 carriers. We tested the relationship of plasma testosterone levels and its interaction with APOE-ε4 status on clinical diagnostic group (CN vs. MCI vs. AD), global, and domain-specific cognitive performance using ANOVAs and linear regression models in sex-stratified samples. Cognitive domains included verbal memory, executive function, processing speed, and language.

Results
We did not observe a significant difference in testosterone levels between clinical diagnostic groups in either sex, regrardless of APOE-ε4 status. Across clinical diagnostic group, we found a significant testosterone by APOE-ε4 interaction in females, such that lower testosterone levels related to worse global cognition, processing speed, and verbal memory in APOE-ε4 carriers only. We did not find that testosterone, nor its interaction with APOE-ε4, related to cognitive outcomes in males.

Conclusions
Findings suggest that low testosterone levels in older female APOE-ε4 carriers across the aging-MCI-AD continuum may have deleterious, domain-specific effects on cognitive performance. Although future studies including additional sex hormones and longitudinal cognitive trajectories are needed, our results highlight the importance of including both sexes and considering APOE-ε4 carrier status when examining testosterone’s role in cognitive health.

Background
The kinins (primarily bradykinin, BK) represent the mediators responsible for local increase of vascular permeability in hereditary angioedema (HAE), HAE I-II associated with alterations of the SERPING1 gene and HAE with normal C1-Inhibitor function (HAE-nC1INH). Besides C1-Inhibitor function and concentration, no biological assay of kinin metabolism is actually available to help physicians for the diagnosis of angioedema (AE). We describe enzymatic tests on the plasma for diagnosis of BK-dependent AE.

Methods
The plasma amidase assays are performed using the Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide peptide substrate to evaluate the spontaneous amidase activity and the proenzyme activation. We analyzed data of 872 patients presenting with BK-dependent AE or BK-unrelated diseases, compared to 303 controls. Anti-high MW kininogen (HK) immunoblot was achieved to confirm HK cleavage in exemplary samples. Reproducibility, repeatability, limit of blank, limit of detection, precision, linearity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used to calculate the diagnostic performance of the assays.

Results
Spontaneous amidase activity was significantly increased in all BK-dependent AE, associated with the acute phase of disease in HAE-nC1INH, but preserved in BK-unrelated disorders. The increase of the amidase activity was associated to HK proteolysis, indicating its relevance to identify kininogenase activity. The oestrogens, known for precipitating AE episodes, were found as triggers of enzymatic activity. Calculations from ROC curves gave the optimum diagnostic cut-off for women (9.3 nmol⋅min−1⋅mL−1, area under curve [AUC] 92.1%, sensitivity 80.0%, and specificity 90.1%) and for men (6.6 nmol·min−1⋅mL−1, AUC 91.0%, sensitivity 87.0% and specificity 81.2%).

Conclusion
The amidase assay represents a diagnostic tool to help physicians in the decision to distinguish between BK-related and –unrelated AE.

"Abstract
Telomerase replenishes telomere tracts by reiteratively copying its RNA template, TER. Unlike other model organisms, Arabidopsis thaliana harbors two divergent TER genes. However, only TER1 is required for telomere maintenance. Here we examine the function of TER2. We show that TER2 is spliced and its 3′ end is truncated in vivo to generate a third TER isoform, TER2S. TERT preferentially associates with TER2 > TER1 > TER2S. Moreover, TER2 and TER2S assemble with Ku and POT1b (protection of telomeres), forming RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complexes distinct from TER1 RNP. Plants null for TER2 display increased telomerase enzyme activity, while TER2 overexpression inhibits telomere synthesis from TER1 and leads to telomere shortening. These findings argue that TER2 negatively regulates telomerase by sequestering TERT in a nonproductive RNP complex. Introduction of DNA double-strand breaks by zeocin leads to an immediate and specific spike in TER2 and a concomitant decrease in telomerase enzyme activity. This response is not triggered by replication stress or telomere dysfunction and is abrogated in ter2 mutants. We conclude that Arabidopsis telomerase is modulated by TER2, a novel DNA damage-induced noncoding RNA that works in concert with the canonical TER to promote genome integrity.

500,000 deaths annually. Considering that the limited therapeutic options for HCC, novel
therapeutic targets and drugs are urgently needed. In this study, we discovered that 1,3,5-
trihydroxy-13,13-dimethyl-2H-pyran [7,6-b] xanthone (TDP), isolated from the traditional
Chinese medicinal herb, Garcinia oblongifolia, effectively inhibited cell growth and induced the
caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in HCC. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
and mass spectrometry-based comparative proteomics were performed to find the molecular
targets of TDP in HCC cells. Eighteen proteins were identified as differently expressed, with
Hsp27 protein being one of the most significantly down-regulated proteins induced by TDP. In
addition, the following gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that Hsp27 mediates
mitochondrial apoptosis induced by TDP. Furthermore, a nude mice model also demonstrated
the suppressive effect of TDP on HCC. Our study suggests that TDP plays apoptosis-inducing
roles by strongly suppressing the Hsp27 expression that is specifically associated with the",1

Background:
While disease-modifying therapies exist for heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), few options are available for patients in the higher range of LVEF (>40%). Sacubitril/valsartan has been compared with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–system inhibitor alone in 2 similarly designed clinical trials of patients with reduced and preserved LVEF, permitting examination of its effects across the full spectrum of LVEF.
Methods:
We combined data from PARADIGM-HF (LVEF eligibility≤40%; n=8399) and PARAGON-HF (LVEF eligibility≥45%; n=4796) in a prespecified pooled analysis. We divided randomized patients into LVEF categories: ≤22.5% (n=1269), >22.5% to 32.5% (n=3987), >32.5% to 42.5% (n=3143), > 42.5% to 52.5% (n=1427), > 52.5% to 62.5% (n=2166), and >62.5% (n=1202). We assessed time to first cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, its components, and total heart failure hospitlizations, all-cause mortality, and noncardiovascular mortality. Incidence rates and treatment effects were examined across categories of LVEF.
Results:
Among 13 195 randomized patients, we observed lower rates of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, but similar rates of noncardiovascular death, among patients in the highest versus the lowest groups. Overall sacubitril/valsartan was superior to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–system inhibition for first cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78–0.90]), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76–0.92]), heart failure hospitalization (HR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.77–0.91]), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81–0.96]). The effect of sacubitril/valsartan was modified by LVEF (treatment-by-continuous LVEF interaction P=0.02), and benefit appeared to be present for individuals with EF primarily below the normal range, although the treatment benefit for cardiovascular death diminished at a lower ejection fraction. We observed effect modification by LVEF on the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan in both men and women with respect to composite total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, although women derived benefit to higher ejection fractions.
Conclusions:
The therapeutic effects of sacubitril/valsartan, compared with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone–system inhibitor alone, vary by LVEF with treatment benefits, particularly for heart failure hospitalization, that appear to extend to patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction. These therapeutic benefits appeared to extend to a higher LVEF range in women compared with men.",1
"Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self-adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non-standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half-infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow-adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self-decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self-adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance. It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision-making and dexterous manipulation.",1
"Abstract
Steep discounting of delayed rewards is linked with a variety of unhealthy behaviors that contribute to
the major causes of preventable death and disease. Growing evidence suggests that decreases in delay
discounting contribute to healthier preferences. This study sought to provide preliminary evidence for
the viability of developing a brief priming task to reduce delay discounting in a large, diverse group of
individuals. Participants (n=1,122) were randomized to one of three conditions: Future Focus (FF),
Present Focus (PF), and Non-Temporal Focus (NTF) intended respectively to decrease, increase, or
have no effect on delay discounting. Participants then completed the Monetary Choice Questionnaire,
a brief assessment of delay discounting rate. Participants randomized to FF exhibited significantly
lower discounting rates than those randomized to PF or NTF conditions. Race, Hispanic background,
social self-monitoring, education, and cigarette smoking also accounted for a significant amount of
variance in the discounting model. These findings provide support for the development of a brief
priming intervention that might be examined in clinical or public health contexts to decrease
discounting and support healthy choices.",1
"Abstract
Research has consistently shown that the appearance of women’s apparel influences men’s behavior and judgment. However, the effect of women’s shoe heels has received little interest. Female confederates wearing black shoes with 0-, 5-, or 9-cm heels walked on the street. In a first experiment, we examined the number of men in the street who smiled at the female confederate. More smiles were addressed to the confederate with high heels. In a second experiment, the confederates asked men and women to respond to a short survey. It was found that high heels increased males’ but not females’ compliance with the request. In a third experiment, photographs of the same woman’s body profile wearing high heels or not were evaluated by men. Results showed that high heels were associated with greater sexiness, overall physical attractiveness, breast attractiveness, beauty, attractiveness to other men, and willingness to date. All the experiments supported the notion that high heels increase women’s attractiveness to men.",1

Background
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) are adjunctive intracoronary imaging modalities used to optimize coronary stent implantation. However, the impact of OCT versus IVUS on clinical outcomes and periprocedural complications is unclear.

Aims
To perform a meta-analysis of all vetted randomized controlled trials comparing OCT-guided versus IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods
We queried MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and clinicalTrials.gov databases from their commencement to February 2024 for all randomized controlled trials that compared OCT-guided versus IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary interventions. The primary endpoint was major adverse periprocedural events (MAPE), a composite of stent thrombosis (ST), distal embolization (DE), and distal edge dissection (DED) at 30 days. The secondary endpoints included ST, DE, DED, major adverse cardiac events (MACE)—(a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction TVMI], and target vessel revascularization [TVR]), all-cause mortality, cardiac death, TVMI, TVR, and nonfatal stroke at 1 year. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was analyzed using a random-effect model.

Results
Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis, and 4446 patients were enrolled. OCT was associated with lower MAPE (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.47–0.91, p = 0.01) compared to IVUS. ST, DE, and DED were similar between OCT and IVUS at 30 days. There were no significant differences in MACE (OR: 0.86, CI: 0.64–1.16, p = 0.32), all-cause mortality (OR: 0.83, CI: 0.42–1.66, p = 0.60), Cardiac death (OR:0.62, CI: 0.20–1.89, p = 0.40), TVMI (OR: 0.69, CI: 0.33–1.46, p = 0.33), TVR, (OR: 1.09, CI: 0.70–1.71, p = 0.70), and Nonfatal stroke (OR: 1.82, CI: 0.67–4.95, p = 0.24) 1 year following the index procedure.

Conclusion
Optical coherence tomographic-guided PCI was associated with lower MAPE, defined as a composite of ST, DE, and DED, compared to IVUS-guided PCI at 30 days of the index procedure. However, there was no difference in overall MACE, TVMI, TVR, and nonfatal stroke at 1 year.",1
"Abstract
Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitously characterized by debilitating social impairments. These difficulties are thought to emerge from aberrant social inference. In order to elucidate the underlying computational mechanisms, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 29), schizophrenia (N = 31), and borderline personality disorder (N = 31) as well as healthy controls (N = 34) performed a probabilistic reward learning task in which participants could learn from social and non-social information. Patients with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder performed more poorly on the task than healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. Broken down by domain, borderline personality disorder patients performed better in the social compared to the non-social domain. In contrast, controls and major depressive disorder patients showed the opposite pattern and schizophrenia patients showed no difference between domains. In effect, borderline personality disorder patients gave up a possible overall performance advantage by concentrating their learning in the social at the expense of the non-social domain. We used computational modeling to assess learning and decision-making parameters estimated for each participant from their behavior. This enabled additional insights into the underlying learning and decision-making mechanisms. Patients with borderline personality disorder showed slower learning from social and non-social information and an exaggerated sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility, both in the non-social and the social domain, but more so in the latter. Regarding decision-making the modeling revealed that compared to controls and major depression patients, patients with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia showed a stronger reliance on social relative to non-social information when making choices. Depressed patients did not differ significantly from controls in this respect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion of a general interpersonal hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia based on a shared computational mechanism characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs about others in making decisions and by an exaggerated need to make sense of others during learning specifically in borderline personality disorder.",1

Background
Total elbow arthroplasty is a relatively uncommon type of arthroplasty, which has undergone several design changes in the past four decades. However, research on improvement requires knowledge of failure mechanisms that can be addressed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review on modes of failure of total elbow arthroplasty.

Methods
We conducted searches on PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify studies describing modes of failure of primary total elbow arthroplasties. The results were coupled per type of total elbow arthroplasty and individual arthroplasty models.

Results
A total of 70 articles were included in this systematic review. 9308 individual total elbow arthroplasties were identified with 1253 revisions (13.5%). Aseptic loosening was the most prevalent reason for revision (38%), followed by deep infection (19%) and periprosthetic fractures (12%).

Conclusion
Revision rates have been found similar to a systematic review published in 2003. The revision percentage of total elbow arthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis is significantly higher than for trauma and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Aseptic loosening was seen less in linked implants. Infections and periprosthetic fractures did not differ between linkage design groups. Aseptic loosening remains the most frequent cause for revision of primary total elbow arthroplasty. Therefore, more research on the occurrence, progression and risk factors of aseptic loosening should be performed and lead to higher implant survival.

Background
In Thailand, dengue fever is one of the most well-known public health problems. The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiology of dengue and determine the seasonal pattern of dengue and its associate to climate factors in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017.

Methods
The dengue cases in Bangkok were collected monthly during the study period. The time-series data were extracted into the trend, seasonal, and random components using the seasonal decomposition procedure based on loess. The Spearman correlation analysis and artificial neuron network (ANN) were used to determine the association between climate variables (humidity, temperature, and rainfall) and dengue cases in Bangkok.

Results
The seasonal-decomposition procedure showed that the seasonal component was weaker than the trend component for dengue cases during the study period. The Spearman correlation analysis showed that rainfall and humidity played a role in dengue transmission with correlation efficiency equal to 0.396 and 0.388, respectively. ANN showed that precipitation was the most crucial factor. The time series multivariate Poisson regression model revealed that increasing 1% of rainfall corresponded to an increase of 3.3% in the dengue cases in Bangkok. There were three models employed to forecast the dengue case, multivariate Poisson regression, ANN, and ARIMA. Each model displayed different accuracy, and multivariate Poisson regression was the most accurate approach in this study.

Conclusion
This work demonstrates the significance of weather in dengue transmission in Bangkok and compares the accuracy of the different mathematical approaches to predict the dengue case. A single model may insufficient to forecast precisely a dengue outbreak, and climate factor may not only indicator of dengue transmissibility.",1
"Abstract
Overexpression of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and its receptor in breast cancer is correlated with poor prognosis. Based on the hypothesis that blockade of CSF-1 would be beneficial in breast cancer treatment, we developed a murinized, polyethylene glycol–linked antigen-binding fragment (Fab) against mouse (host) CSF-1 (anti-CSF-1 Fab). Mice bearing human, chemoresistant MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts were treated with combination chemotherapy (CMF: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil; cycled twice i.p.), anti-CSF-1 Fab (i.p., cycled every 3 days for 14 days), combined CMF and anti-CSF-1 Fab, or with Ringer's solution as a control. Anti-CSF-1 Fab alone suppressed tissue CSF-1 and retarded tumor growth by 40%. Importantly, in combination with CMF, anti-CSF-1 Fab reversed chemoresistance of MCF-7 xenografts, suppressing tumor development by 56%, down-regulating expression of the chemoresistance genes breast cancer–related protein, multidrug resistance gene 1, and glucosylceramide synthase, and prolonging survival significantly. Combined treatment also reduced angiogenesis and macrophage recruitment and down-regulated tumor matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-12 expression. These studies support the paradigm of CSF-1 blockade in the treatment of solid tumors and show that anti-CSF-1 antibodies are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of mammary cancer.

"Abstract
A high sensitivity method for detecting low level mutations is under development. A PCR reaction is performed in which a restriction site is introduced in wild-type DNA by alteration of specific bases. Digestion of wild-type DNA by the cognate restriction endonuclease (RE) enriches for products with mutations within the recognition site. After reamplification, mutations are identified by a ligation detection reaction (LDR). This PCR/RE/LDR assay was initially used to detect PCR error in known wild-type samples. PCR error was measured in low |ΔpKa| buffers containing tricine, EPPS and citrate, as well as otherwise identical buffers containing Tris. PCR conditions were optimized to minimize PCR error using perfect match primers at the MspI site in the p53 tumor suppressor gene at codon 248. However, since mutations do not always occur within pre-existing restriction sites, a generalized PCR/RE/LDR method requires the introduction of a new restriction site. In principle, PCR with mismatch primers can alter specific bases in a sequence and generate a new restriction site. However, extension from 3′ mismatch primers may generate misextension products. We tested conversion of the MspI (CCGG) site to a TaqI site (TCGA). Conversion was unsuccessful using a natural base T mismatch primer set. Conversion was successful when modified primers containing the 6H,8H-3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-c][1,2]oxazine-7-one (Q6) base at 3′-ends were used in three cycles of preconversion PCR prior to conversion PCR using the 3′ natural base T primers. The ability of the pyrimidine analog Q6 to access both a T-like and C-like tautomer appears to greatly facilitate the conversion.",1
"Abstract
Hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization is a major pathological condition in many vision-threatening diseases. In the present study, we determined whether interleukin (IL)-12, a cytokine that regulates angiogenesis, plays a role in the neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). We found that the expressions of the mRNAs of both IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 were significantly reduced in the OIR retinas compared to that of the room air-raised control. The sizes of the avascular areas and neovascular tufts were larger in IL-12p40 knock-out (KO) mice than that in wild type (WT) mice. In addition, an intravitreal injection of recombinant IL-12 reduced both avascular areas and neovascular tufts. IL-12 injection enhanced the expressions of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and other downstream chemokines. In an in vitro system, IL-12 had no significant effect on tube formation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs). Moreover, a blockade of IFN-γ suppressed the inhibitory effect of IL-12 on pathological neovascularization. These results suggest that IL-12 plays important roles in inhibiting pathological retinal neovascularization.",1
"Abstract
Circadian rhythms in the Syrian hamster can be markedly phase shifted by 3 h of wheel running or arousal stimulation during their usual daily rest period (“subjective day”). Continuous wheel running is predictive but not necessary for phase shifts of this “nonphotic” type; hamsters aroused by gentle handling without running can also show maximal shifts. By contrast, physical restraint, a standard stress procedure and thus presumably arousing, is ineffective. To resolve this apparent paradox, phase-shifting effects of 3-h sessions of restraint or other stress procedures were assessed. In a preliminary study, phase shifts to arousal by gentle handling were significantly potentiated by the cortisol synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, suggesting that stress-related cortisol release may inhibit phase shifts to arousal. Next, it was confirmed that restraint in the subjective day does not induce phase shifts, but behavioral observations revealed that it also does not sustain arousal. Restraint combined with noxious compressed air blasts did sustain arousal and induced a significant cortisol response compared with arousal by gentle handling but did not induce shifts. Restraint combined with continuous horizontal rotation was also ineffective, as was EEG-validated arousal via confinement to a pedestal over water. However, 3 h of resident-intruder interactions (an intense psychosocial stress) or exposure to an open field (a mild stress) did induce large shifts that were positively correlated with indexes of forward locomotion. The results indicate that large phase shifts associated with arousal in the usual sleep period are neither induced nor prevented by stress per se, but are dependent on the expression of at least low levels of locomotor activity. Sustained arousal alone is not sufficient.",1

Background
The efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unclear. This meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

Hypothesis
Short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment may be beneficial in reducing major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and improving myocardial blood flow in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically reviewed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to March 2013, in which short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment was compared with control for patients with ACS undergoing PCI. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of MACEs at 30 days. The meta-analysis was performed with the fixed effect model or random-effects model according to the heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.0 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Results
Nine RCTs incorporating 952 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment significantly reduced the incidence of MACEs at 30-day follow-up (risk ratio [RR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.25 to 0.61, P < 0.001) and improved the final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade (RR 1.08, 95% Cl: 1.02 to 1.14, P = 0.01) compared with controls. There were no significant differences in peak creatine kinase-myocardial band and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level post-PCI between the 2 groups, though there were favorable trends related to statin use. As to the safety end points, no significant difference was observed in elevated liver aminotransferase level between short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment and control groups (RR 1.36, 95% Cl: 0.67 to 2.74).

Conclusions
The use of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment is safe and significantly improves the final TIMI flow grade as well as reduces the 30-day MACEs in ACS patients post-PCI. This finding encourages the use of short-term high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment as an alternative for ACS patients undergoing PCI, but more high-quality randomized clinical trials are still needed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety.",1
"Abstract
Background
The efficacy of amodiaquine (AQ), sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and the combination of SP+AQ in the treatment of Cameroonian children with clinical malaria was investigated. The prevalence of molecular markers for resistance to these drugs was studied to set the baseline for surveillance of their evolution with time.

Methods
Seven hundred and sixty children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were studied in three ecologically different regions of Cameroon - Mutengene (littoral equatorial forest), Yaoundé (forest-savannah mosaic) and Garoua (guinea-savannah). Study children were randomized to receive either AQ, SP or the combination AQ+SP. Clinical outcome was classified according to WHO criteria, as either early treatment failure (ETF), late clinical failure (LCF), late parasitological failure (LPF) or adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). The occurrence of mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhfr and dhps genes was studied by either RFLP or dot blot techniques and the prevalence of these mutations related to parasitological and therapeutic failures.

Results
After correction for the occurrence of re-infection by PCR, ACPRs on day 28 for AQ, SP and AQ+SP were 71.2%, 70.1% and 80.9%, in Garoua, 79.2%, 62.5%, and 81.9% in Mutengene, and 80.3%, 67.5% and 76.2% in Yaoundé respectively. High levels of Pfcrt 76T (87.11%) and Pfmdr1 86Y mutations (73.83%) were associated with quinoline resistance in the south compared to the north, 31.67% (76T) and 22.08% (86Y). There was a significant variation (p < 0.001) of the prevalence of the SGK haplotype between Garoua in the north (8.33%), Yaoundé (36.29%) in the savannah-forest mosaic and Mutengene (66.41%) in the South of Cameroon and a weak relation between SGK haplotype and SP failure. The 540E mutation on the dhps gene was extremely rare (0.3%) and occurred only in Mutengene while the pfmdr1 1034K and 1040D mutations were not detected in any of the three sites.

Conclusion
In this study the prevalence of molecular markers for quinoline and anti-folate resistances showed high levels and differed between the south and north of Cameroon. AQ, SP and AQ+SP treatments were well tolerated but with low levels of efficacy that suggested alternative treatments were needed in Cameroon since 2005.",1
"Abstract
Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) mortality, cardiovascular (CV) complications and kidney disease progression. However, their association with clinical outcomes remains poorly evaluated. We used real-time qPCR to measure serum levels of miR-126 and miR-223 in a large cohort of 601 CKD patients (CKD stage G1 to G5 patients or on renal replacement therapy – CKD G5D) from Ghent University Hospital and 31 healthy controls. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular and renal events were registered as endpoints over a 6 year follow-up period. miR-126 levels were significantly lower from CKD stage G2 on, compared to controls. The serum levels of miR-223 were significantly lower from CKD stage G3B on. When considering overall mortality, patients with levels of either miR-126 or miR-223 below the median had a lower survival rate. Similar results were observed for CV and renal events. The observed link between the two miRNAs’ seric levels and mortality, cardiovascular events or renal events in CKD appears to depend on eGFR. However, this does not preclude their potential role in the pathophysiology of CKD. In conclusion, CKD is associated with a decrease in circulating miR-223 and miR-126 levels.",1
"Abstract
The present study investigates if mothers and fathers have similar ways of thinking and feeling about their babies during late pregnancy and how aspects of parental–fetal attachment are related to maternal depressive mood. Two hundred and ninety-eight Swedish-speaking women at 30–32 weeks of gestation and partners (n = 274) participated in the study. Socio-demographic background data were collected. Prenatal attachment was assessed with the maternal/paternal–fetal attachment scale (MFA/PFA), and depressive symptoms were assessed by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). MFA and PFA scores mirrored each other. After factor analysis, five different factors loaded somewhat differently for men were revealed as significant. These factors were (I) concerns about the fetus and health behavior, (II) mental preparation to take care of the unborn child, (III) experiences of pregnancy, (IV) experiences of fetal movements, and (V) naming of the baby. Factors III and IV were related to depressive symptoms. Mothers with slight depressive symptoms were somewhat less positive about the pregnancy but showed more attention to the fetal movements. Midwives should conduct interviews on the women’s psychosocial history and use validated instruments, which may help them to identify problems with the psychosocial health of the mother and her partner as they journey through pregnancy and transition to parenthood.",1
"ABSTRACT
Objective:
To investigate the effects of wobbling angle on the stability measures of orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) during insertion and removal procedures in artificial bone blocks.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 36 OMIs (self-drilling type, cylindrical shape, 7 mm in length, 1.45 mm in diameter) were allocated into three groups according to the amount of wobbling angle (W-0°, W-2°, and W-4° groups; N = 12 per group). The OMIs were installed and subsequently removed from artificial bone blocks (Sawbone) using a driving torque tester with a uniform speed of 28 rpm. Insertion peak time (IPT), maximum insertion torque (MIT), total insertion energy (TIE), near-peak insertion energy (NPIE), maximum removal torque (MRT), and near-peak removal energy (NPRE) were measured.

Results:
The W-4° group showed the longest IPT and highest TIE and NPIE, followed by the W-2° and W-0° groups (W-0° < W-2° < W-4°, all P < .001). The W-2° and W-4° groups showed significant increase in MIT compared with the W-0° group (W-0° < [W-4°,W-2°]; P < .001). Although there was no significant difference in NPRE among the three groups, the W-4° group showed a decrease in MRT compared with the W-0° and W-2° groups (W-4° < {W-2°,W-0°]; P < .05). Although the W-4° group showed a 14.5% (2.9 Ncm) increase in MIT compared with the W-0° group, there was only a 6% (1.3 Ncm) decrease in MRT from the W-0° group to the W-4° group.

Conclusion:
Slight wobbling during the OMI insertion procedure may be acceptable in terms of the stability measures of OMIs during insertion and removal procedures.",1

Background
It has been well established that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important regulatory role during tumor progression. Recent studies have indicated that even though circRNAs generally regulate gene expression through miRNA sponges, they may encode small peptides in tumor pathogenesis. However, it remains largely unexplored whether circRNAs are involved in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer (CC).

Methods
The expression profiles of circRNAs in CC tissues were assessed by circRNA microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR, RNase R digestion assay and tissue microarray were used to confirm the existence and expression pattern of circPPP1R12A. The subcellular distribution of circPPP1R12A was analyzed by nuclear mass separation assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). SDS-PAGE and LC/MS were employed to evaluate the protein-coding ability of circPPP1R12A. CC cells were stably transfected with lentivirus approach, and cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as tumorigenesis and metastasis in nude mice were assessed to clarify the functional roles of circPPP1R12A and its encoded protein circPPP1R12A-73aa. RNA-sequencing and Western blotting analysis were furthered employed to identify the critical signaling pathway regulated by circPPP1R12A-73aa.

Results
We firstly screened the expression profiles of human circRNAs in CC tissues and found that the expression of hsa_circ_0000423 (termed as circPPP1R12A) was significantly increased in CC tissues. We also found that circPPP1R12A was mostly localized in the cytoplasm of CC cells. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that patients with higher levels of circPPP1R12A had a significantly shorter overall survival. By gain- and loss-of-function approaches, the results suggested that circPPP1R12A played a critical role in proliferation, migration and invasion of CC cells. Furthermore, we showed that circPPP1R12A carried an open reading frame (ORF), which encoded a functional protein (termed as circPPP1R12A-73aa). Next, we found that PPP1R12A-C, not circPPP1R12A, promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of CC in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified that circPPP1R12A-73aa promoted the growth and metastasis of CC via activating Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. In addition, the YAP specific inhibitor Peptide 17 dramatically alleviated the promotive effect of circPPP1R12A-73aa on CC cells.

Conclusions
In the present study, we illustrated the coding-potential of circRNA circPPP1R12A in the progression of CC. Moreover, we identified that circPPP1R12A-73aa promoted the tumor pathogenesis and metastasis of CC via activating Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Our findings might provide valuable insights into the development of novel potential therapeutic targets for CC.",1
"Abstract
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to recanalization of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play regulatory roles in functions of EPCs, which is becoming a promising therapeutic choice for thrombus resolution. The main purpose of this study was to explore the effect of miR-125a-5p on EPC functions in deep vein thrombosis (DVT). EPCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with DVT. In DVT mouse models, DVT was induced by stenosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The levels of miR-125a-5p and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) in EPCs and thrombi of DVT mice were detected by RT-qPCR. EPC migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were estimated by Transwell assay, tube formation assay, and flow cytometry analysis. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized for detecting the binding of miR-125a-5p and MCL-1. The phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT was estimated by western blot. DVT formation in vivo was observed through hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining. The expression of thrombus resolution marker, CD34 molecule (CD34), in the thrombi was measured by immunofluorescence staining. MiR-125a-5p upregulation repressed EPC migration and angiogenesis and facilitated apoptosis. MiR-125a-5p downregulation showed the opposite effect. MCL-1 was targeted and negatively regulated by miR-125a-5p. Additionally, miR-125a-5p inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in EPCs. Inhibition of MCL-1 or PI3K/AKT pathway reversed the effect of miR-125a-5p knockdown on EPC functions. The in vivo experiments revealed that miR-125a-5p downregulation repressed thrombus formation and promoted the homing capability of EPCs to the thrombosis site, thereby alleviating DVT mice. Downregulation of miR-125a-5p promotes EPC migration and angiogenesis by upregulating MCL-1, thereby enhancing EPC homing to thrombi and facilitating thrombus resolution.

"Abstract
The HLA molecules are membrane-bound transporters that carry peptides from the cytoplasm to the cell surface for surveillance by circulating T lymphocytes. Although low levels of soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) are normally released into the blood, many types of tumor cells release larger amounts of these sHLA molecules, presumably to counter immune surveillance by T cells. Here we demonstrate that these sHLA molecules are still bound with their authentic peptide repertoires, similar to those of the membranal HLA molecules (mHLA). Therefore, a single immunoaffinity purification of the plasma sHLA molecules, starting with a few milliliters of patients’ blood, allows for identification of very large sHLA peptidomes by mass spectrometry, forming a foundation for development of a simple and universal blood-based cancer diagnosis. The new methodology was validated using plasma and tumor cells of multiple-myeloma and leukemia patients, plasma of healthy controls, and with cultured cancer cells. The analyses identified thousands of sHLA peptides, including some cancer-related peptides, present among the sHLA peptidomes of the cancer patients. Furthermore, because the HLA peptides are the degradation products of the cellular proteins, this sHLA peptidomics approach opens the way for investigation of the patterns of protein synthesis and degradation within the tumor cells.",1
"Abstract Different methods to estimate the plasma membrane potential difference (PMP) of yeast cells with
fluorescent monitors were compared. The validity of the
methods was tested by the fluorescence difference with or
without glucose, and its decrease by the addition of 10 mM
KCl. Low CaCl2 concentrations avoid binding of the dye to
the cell surface, and low CCCP concentrations avoid its
accumulation by mitochondria. Lower concentrations of
Ba2+ produce a similar effect as Ca2+, without producing
the fluorescence changes derived from its transport.
Fluorescence changes without considering binding of the
dyes to the cells and accumulation by mitochondria are
overshadowed by their distribution between this organelle and
the cytoplasm. Other factors, such as yeast starvation, dye
used, parameters of the fluorescence changes, as well as
buffers and incubation times were analyzed. An additional
approach to measure the actual or relative values of PMP,

"Abstract
When activated, the proapoptotic protein Bax permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing the release of proteins into the cytosol and thus initiating the execution phase of apoptosis. When activated Bax was reconstituted into phospholipid membranes, we discovered a new, to our knowledge, property of Bax channels: voltage gating. We also found that the same Bax sample under the same experimental conditions could give rise to two radically different channels: Type A, which is small, well behaved, homogeneous, and voltage-gated, and Type B, which is large, noisy, and voltage-independent. One Type B channel can be converted irreversibly into a population of Type A channels by the addition of La3+. This conversion process appears to involve a two-dimensional budding mechanism. The existence of these two types of Bax channels suggests a process for controlling the degree of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.",1

Objective: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequent degenerative disease representing an important health
and economic burden. Symptomatic medical treatments available include intra-articular (IA) injections
of corticosteroids (GC) but their efficacy and safety profile are debated.
Methods: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) and a meta-analysis (MA) of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of IA GC injections for knee OA. The effect of the interventions
on pain and function was extracted from the single studies and pooled. Standardized mean differences
(SMD) are reported.
Results: Of 520 studies screened, 23 were included in the SLR and 15 subsequently included in the MA.
IA GC showed a trend towards a superior effect compared to control on both pain (SMD −0.61 (95% CI:
−1.25, 0.03)) and function (SMD −1.02 (95% CI: −2.14, 0.10)) in short term follow-up (≤ 6 weeks), while
long term follow-up (≥ 24 weeks) analysis showed a trend towards superiority of controls (IA HA, IA
NSAID, physiotherapy) for pain (SMD 0.68 (95% CI: −0.11, 1.47)) and function (SMD 0.88 (95% CI: −0.36,
2.12). There were no differences between interventions in medium term (> 6 weeks & < 24 weeks).
Conclusion: In this work, IA GC injections reduced pain and improved function early after administration
(≤ 6 weeks) compared to placebo; while this result was no longer statistically significant with other
comparators (IA hyaluronic acid or physiotherapy). Other interventions seem to be more efficient in the
long term (≥ 24 weeks) but this effect was largely driven by single studies with large effect sizes.

"Abstract
Purpose of Review
The purpose of this review is to investigate the use and efficacy of fertility tracking applications as a natural contraceptive method since there has been a worldwide increase in the development and use of applications that monitor the menstrual cycle and fertility window. An anonymous online survey had been conducted in order to achieve this goal, and a total of 375 married women from Jordan responded to our survey.

Recent Findings
Topics discussed include fertility awareness-based methods (FAM) of contraception in which mobile applications fall into, and their efficacy and failure rates, comparing them with other methods of contraception while taking into account the typical and perfect use of each method. Motivation has also been looked at as a factor affecting the efficacy of FAM and advantages/disadvantages of this method were discussed. The prevalence of mobile applications that monitor fertility signs and their expected increased use over the next years was also discussed.

Summary
The use of fertility tracking applications is not uncommon amongst sexually active women in reproductive age, and the majority of users rely on them to track their fertility window. However, the efficacy of such applications as a method of contraception is not high and there is a significant failure rate especially if used alone. It is worth noting that 50% of women who reported failure relied solely on mobile applications and fertility window assessment without using other methods of contraception, and thus we advise women to use more reliable methods of contraception and not rely solely on such applications.

"Objectives: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by pervasive deficits
in social interaction, impairment in verbal and non-verbal communication, and stereotyped patterns of
interests and activities. Vitamin-D deficiency was previously reported in autistic children. However, the
data on the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of autism are limited.
Methods: We performed a case–controlled cross-sectional analysis conducted on 122 ASD children, to
assess their vitamin D status compared to controls and the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and
the severity of autism. We also conducted an open trial of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children.
Results: Fifty-seven percent of the patients in the present study had vitamin D deficiency, and 30% had
vitamin D insufficiency. The mean 25-OHD levels in patients with severe autism were significantly lower
than those in patients with mild/moderate autism. Serum 25-OHD levels had significant negative
correlations with Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores. Of the ASD group, 106 patients with lowserum 25-OHD levels (<30 ng/ml) participated in the open label trial. They received vitamin D3 (300 IU/
kg/day not to exceed 5000 IU/day) for 3 months. Eighty-three subjects completed 3 months of daily
vitamin D treatment. Collectively, 80.72% (67/83) of subjects who received vitamin D3 treatment had
significantly improved outcome, which was mainly in the sections of the CARS and aberrant behavior
checklist subscales that measure behavior, stereotypy, eye contact, and attention span.
Conclusion: Vitamin D is inexpensive, readily available and safe. It may have beneficial effects in ASD
subjects, especially when the final serum level is more than 40 ng/ml.

"Abstract: The interaction mechanism between hydraulic fractures and natural
15 fractures has been the focus of hydraulic fracturing research. To reveal the effect of
16 natural fracture morphology on hydraulic fracture propagation during the fracturing
17 process, this study first presets natural fractures with different degrees of curvature in
18 artificial rock samples and then conducted large-size true triaxial hydraulic fracturing
19 physical model experiments to simulate the propagation behaviors of hydraulic
20 fractures with natural fractures of different curvature degrees under the normal state of
21 geostress. The results show that when the approach angle is 90°, with the gradual
22 decrease of fracturing fluid injection rate, the interaction between the hydraulic fracture
23 and the natural fracture shows that the hydraulic fracture penetrates through the natural
24 fracture directly, and gradually changes to the hydraulic fracture penetrating through
25 the natural fracture and simultaneously extending along the natural fracture, and then
26 only the hydraulic fracture extending along the natural fracture occurs in the end. When
27 the injection rate is constant and the angle of approximation is 90°, as the degree of

"It is well known that glycogen and trehalose accumulate in yeast under
nutrient starvation or entering into the stationary phase of growth, and that
high levels of trehalose are found in heat-shocked cells. However, effects of
various types of stress on trehalose, and especially on glycogen, are poorly
documented. Taking into account that almost all genes encoding the enzymes
involved in the metabolism of these two reserve carbohydrates contain
between one and several copies of the stress-responsive element (STRE), an
investigation was made of the possibility of a link between the potential
transcriptional induction of these genes and the accumulation of glycogen and
trehalose under different stress conditions. Using transcriptional fusions, it
was found that all these genes were induced in a similar fashion, although to
various extents, by temperature, osmotic and oxidative stresses. Experiments
performed with an msn2/msn4 double mutant proved that the transcriptional
induction of the genes encoding glycogen synthase (GSY2) and trehalose-6-
phosphate synthase (TPS7) was needed for the small increase in glycogen and
trehalose upon exposure to a mild heat stress and salt shock. However, the
extent of transcriptional activation of these genes upon stresses in wild-type
strains was not correlated with a proportional rise in either glycogen or
trehalose. The major explanation for this lack of correlation comes from the
fact that genes encoding the enzymes of the biosynthetic and of the
biodegradative pathways were almost equally induced. Hence, trehalose and
glycogen accumulated to much higher levels in cells lacking neutral trehalase
or glycogen phosphorylase exposed to stress conditions, which suggested that
one of the major effects of stress in yeast is to induce a wasteful expenditure
of energy by increasing the recycling of these molecules. We also found that
transcriptional induction of STRE-controlled genes was abolished at
temperatures above 40 ""C, while induction was still observed for a heat-shockelement-regulated gene. Remarkably, trehalose accumulated to very high
levels under this condition. This can be explained by a stimulation of trehalose
synthase and inhibition of trehalase by high temperature. ",1
"Abstract
Aim
To assess the relationship between marijuana use, cigarette smoking and metabolic syndrome among adults in the United States who reported they use marijuana or cigarettes in comparison to non-marijuana and non-cigarette users.
Method
We conducted multiple logistic regression analyses using data from the 2011–2012 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate relationships between cardio-metabolic risk factors and increasing years of smoking cigarette or marijuana use. Statistical adjustments were made for both demographic and endogenous factors related to recreational substance use.
Results
Each year increase in marijuana use was significantly associated with increased odds of metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), and hypertension (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07) adjusting for both demographic and endogenous factors related to recreational substance use. Each year increase in cigarette smoking was significantly associated with increased odds of hypertension (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06) and hyperglycemia (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) after adjusting for confounders.
Conclusion
The results of this investigation suggest that increased years of marijuana or cigarette use are important factors in metabolic health; and consequently calls for the need to consider the potential negative effects of marijuana or cigarette for metabolic syndrome and its associated cardio-metabolic risk components.",1
"ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Positive effects have been reported after mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in diverse clinical and nonclinical populations. Primary care is a key
health care setting for addressing common chronic conditions, and an effective
MBI designed for this setting could benefit countless people worldwide. Metaanalyses of MBIs have become popular, but little is known about their efficacy
in primary care. Our aim was to investigate the application and efficacy of MBIs
that address primary care patients.
METHODS We performed a meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials
addressing the effect of MBIs in adult patients recruited from primary care settings. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses) and Cochrane guidelines were followed. Effect sizes were calculated
with the Hedges g in random effects models.
RESULTS The meta-analyses were based on 6 trials having a total of 553
patients. The overall effect size of MBI compared with a control condition for
improving general health was moderate (g=0.48; P=.002), with moderate heterogeneity (I2=59; P <.05). We found no indication of publication bias in the
overall estimates. MBIs were efficacious for improving mental health (g=0.56;
P=.007), with a high heterogeneity (I2=78; P <.01), and for improving quality
of life (g=0.29; P=.002), with a low heterogeneity (I2=0; P >.05).
CONCLUSIONS Although the number of randomized controlled trials applying
MBIs in primary care is still limited, our results suggest that these interventions
are promising for the mental health and quality of life of primary care patients.
We discuss innovative approaches for implementing MBIs, such as complex intervention and stepped care.",1
"In the last 50 years, archaeological finds from Amazonia have forced revision of some theories about human evolution. A common assumption had been that human evolution was restricted by environmental limitations which favored slow progression from simple, unspecialized, economically unproductive cultures to complex, specialized, and highly productive ones. This assumption has long influenced interpretations of human evolution in the humid tropics 1 4. It presumed that the first Americans would not have been broad spectrum foragers but instead big game hunters following herds from the Siberian steppes into similar American habitats 8.Only after those megafauna went extinct at the end of the Ice Age were people hypothesized to have developed agriculture in the dry, open vegetation valleys of the Central Andes and Mesoamerica, before finally migrating into the tropical forests and coastal lowlands 9. According to the environmental limitation theory, only cooler agricultural zones fostered conditions that gave rise to civilized achievements like math, astronomy, and calendars exhibited by the Maya, Aztec, and Inca. Hunter gatherers were notpredicted to need, nor deemed capable of devising such cultural achievements.",1
"Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to improve ALI, and the imbalance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells is associated with mortality in ALI/ARDS patients. However, whether administration of lung-resident MSC (LRMSC) improves lung injury and regulates the balance of Tregs and Th17 cells remains unknown. An ALI animal model was induced by LPS, and PBS or LRMSC were administered via tail vein after 4 h. LRMSC were subsequently detected in the lungs by a live imaging system (Berthold LB983, Germany). Lung morphology; lung wet-to-dry weight ratio; and total protein concentration, inflammatory cells, and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma were determined. The percentage of Tregs in lung and spleen, and of Th17 cells in lung and blood, were also evaluated. The results showed that LRMSC not only attenuated histopathological damage but also mediated the downregulation of lung wet-to-dry weight ratio and the reduction of total protein concentration and inflammatory cells in BALF. LRMSC also decreased inflammatory cytokines in both BALF and plasma and increased KGF-2 and surfactant protein C (SPC) expression in the lung. Flow cytometry revealed the upregulation of Tregs and the downregulation of Th17 cells, and the increase in the ratio of Tregs and Th17 cells. The live imaging system showed that LRMSC migrated to and were retained in the injured area. In conclusion, the results indicated that administration of LRMSC attenuates LPS-induced ALI via upregulating the balance of Tregs and Th17 cells.

"Objective: We aimed to clarify the long-term risk development of EAC after
antireflux surgery.
Summary of Background Data: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
increases EAC risk, but whether antireflux surgery prevents EAC is uncertain.
Methods: Multinational, population-based cohort study including individuals with GERD from all 5 Nordic countries in 1964–2014. First, EAC risk
after antireflux surgery in the cohort was compared with the corresponding
background population by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Second, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, providing hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs,
compared EAC risk in GERD patients with antireflux surgery with those
with nonsurgical treatment.
Results: Among 942,071 GERD patients, 48,863 underwent surgery and
893,208 did not. Compared to the corresponding background population,
EAC risk did not decrease after antireflux surgery [SIR 4.90 (95% CI 3.62–
6.47) 1–<5 years and SIR 4.57 (95% CI 3.44–5.95) 15 years after surgery].
Similarly, no decrease was found for patients with severe GERD (esophagitis
or Barrett esophagus) after surgery [SIR 6.09 (95% CI 4.39–8.23) 1–<5 years
and SIR ¼ 5.27 (95% CI 3.73–7.23) 15 years]. The HRs of EAC were stable

"Abstract
The authors report a new graphene oxide nanosheet (GONS) based fluorescence method for mRNA assay with duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted signal amplification. Following hybridization between the target mRNA and its complementary DNA probe, the ssDNA in the DNA/mRNA hybrid is selectively cleaved by DSN to produce small fragments. The released mRNA molecule then initiates another cycle of hybridization and DSN digestion. In this manner, each mRNA molecule can specifically trigger many cycles of hybridization and DNA cleavages to produce numerous small DNA fragments. The short DNA fragments can exhibit strong fluorescence signals due to the weak adsorption of GONS to them. This fluorescence assay for mRNA with increased selectivity has a 1 fM detection limit under optimal conditions. Furthermore, this assay was successfully used for mRNA imaging in situ.",1
"Abstract
Objective
To profile the prevalence of the three body mass index (BMI) categories by sociodemographic characteristics, and to calculate the percentage transitioning (or not) from one BMI category to another, to inform South African health policy for the control of obesity and noncommunicable diseases.

Methods
We used data from the National Income Dynamics Study, including sociodemographic characteristics and BMI measurements collected in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2017. For each data collection wave and each population group, we calculated mean BMI and prevalence by category. We also calculated the percentage making an upwards transition (e.g. from overweight to obese), a downwards transition or remaining within a particular category. We used a multinomial logistic regression model to estimate transition likelihood.

Findings
Between 2008 and 2017, mean BMI increased by 2.3 kg/m2. We calculated an increased prevalence of obesity from 19.7% (3686/18 679) to 23.6% (3412/14 463), with the largest increases in prevalence for those aged 19–24 years and those with at least high school education. The percentages of upwards transitions to overweight or obese categories increased sharply between the ages of 19 and 50 years. Once overweight or obese, the likelihood of transitioning to a normal BMI is low, particularly for women, those of higher age groups, and those with a higher income and a higher level of education.

Conclusion
In the development of national strategies to control obesity and noncommunicable diseases, our results will allow limited public health resources to be focused on the relevant population groups.

"Background: It has been proposed that night shift work could increase breast cancer incidence. A 2007 World Health Organization review concluded, mainly from animal evidence, that shift work involving circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans. We therefore aimed to generate prospective epidemiological evidence on night shift work and breast cancer incidence.

Methods: Overall, 522 246 Million Women Study, 22 559 EPIC-Oxford, and 251 045 UK Biobank participants answered questions on shift work and were followed for incident cancer. Cox regression yielded multivariable-adjusted breast cancer incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for night shift work vs no night shift work, and likelihood ratio tests for interaction were used to assess heterogeneity. Our meta-analyses combined these and relative risks from the seven previously published prospective studies (1.4 million women in total), using inverse-variance weighted averages of the study-specific log RRs.

Results: In the Million Women Study, EPIC-Oxford, and UK Biobank, respectively, 673, 28, and 67 women who reported night shift work developed breast cancer, and the RRs for any vs no night shift work were 1.00 (95% CI = 0.92 to 1.08), 1.07 (95% CI = 0.71 to 1.62), and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.61 to 1.00). In the Million Women Study, the RR for 20 or more years of night shift work was 1.00 (95% CI = 0.81 to 1.23), with no statistically significant heterogeneity by sleep patterns or breast cancer risk factors. Our meta-analysis of all 10 prospective studies included 4660 breast cancers in women reporting night shift work; compared with other women, the combined relative risks were 0.99 (95% CI = 0.95 to 1.03) for any night shift work, 1.01 (95% CI = 0.93 to 1.10) for 20 or more years of night shift work, and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.87 to 1.14) for 30 or more years.

Conclusions: The totality of the prospective evidence shows that night shift work, including long-term shift work, has little or no effect on breast cancer incidence.",1

"Abstract
The dopamine D3 receptor is a prime target for developing treatments for cocaine use disorders (CUDs). In this study, we conducted a pre-clinical investigation of the therapeutic potential of a long-acting, D3 receptor partial agonist, MC-25-41. Male rats were pre-treated with MC-25-41 (vehicle, 1.0, 3.0, 5.6, or 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP)) five minutes prior to tests of cocaine or sucrose intake on either a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement or a variable interval 60 s multiple schedule consisting of 4, 15-min components with sucrose or cocaine available in alternating components. A separate cohort of rats was tested on a within-session, dose-reduction procedure to determine the effects of MC-25-41 on demand for cocaine using a behavioral economics analysis. Finally, rats were tested for effects of MC-25-41 on spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion. MC-25-41 failed to alter locomotion, but reduced reinforcement rates for both cocaine and sucrose on the low-effort, multiple schedule. However, on the higher-effort, progressive ratio schedule of cocaine reinforcement, MC-25-41 reduced infusions, and active lever presses at doses that did not alter sucrose intake. The behavioral economics analysis showed that MC-25-41 also increased cocaine demand elasticity compared to vehicle, indicating a reduction in consumption as price increases. Together, these results suggest that similar to other D3-selective antagonists and partial agonists, MC-25-41 reduces motivation for cocaine under conditions of high cost but has the added advantage of a long half-life (>10 h). These findings suggest that MC-25-41 may be a suitable pre-clinical lead compound for development of medications to treat CUDs.

Objective
Antibodies against posttranslationally modified proteins are a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the emergence and pathogenicity of these autoantibodies are still incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the antigen specificities and mutation patterns of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) derived from RA synovial plasma cells and address the question of antigen cross-reactivity.

Methods
IgG-secreting cells were isolated from RA synovial fluid, and the variable regions of the immunoglobulins were sequenced (n = 182) and expressed in full-length mAb (n = 93) and also as germline-reverted versions. The patterns of reactivity with 53,019 citrullinated peptides and 49,211 carbamylated peptides and the potential of the mAb to promote osteoclastogenesis were investigated.

Results
Four unrelated anti–citrullinated protein autoantibodies (ACPAs), of which one was clonally expanded, were identified and found to be highly somatically mutated in the synovial fluid of a patient with RA. The ACPAs recognized >3,000 unique peptides modified by either citrullination or carbamylation. This highly multireactive autoantibody feature was replicated for Ig sequences derived from B cells from the peripheral blood of other RA patients. The plasma cell–derived mAb were found to target distinct amino acid motifs and partially overlapping protein targets. They also conveyed different effector functions as revealed in an osteoclast activation assay.

Conclusion
These findings suggest that the high level of cross-reactivity among RA autoreactive B cells is the result of different antigen encounters, possibly at different sites and at different time points. This is consistent with the notion that RA is initiated in one context, such as in the mucosal organs, and thereafter targets other sites, such as the joints.",1
"Abstract
Darkness can conceal identity and encourage moral transgressions; it may also induce a psychological
feeling of illusory anonymity that disinhibits dishonest and self-interested behavior regardless of actual
anonymity. Three experiments provided empirical evidence supporting this prediction. In Experiment 1,
participants in a room with slightly dimmed lighting cheated more and thus earned more undeserved
money than those in a well-lit room. In Experiment 2, participants wearing sunglasses behaved more
selfishly than those wearing clear glasses. Finally, in Experiment 3, an illusory sense of anonymity
mediated the relationship between darkness and self-interested behaviors. Across all three
experiments, darkness had no bearing on actual anonymity, yet it still increased morally questionable
behaviors. We suggest that the experience of darkness, even when subtle, may induce a sense of
anonymity that is not proportionate to actual anonymity in a given situation.

Importance  Between 1980 and 2000, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly among adult men and women in the United States; further significant increases were observed through 2003-2004 for men but not women. Subsequent comparisons of data from 2003-2004 with data through 2011-2012 showed no significant increases for men or women.

Objective  To examine obesity prevalence for 2013-2014 and trends over the decade from 2005 through 2014 adjusting for sex, age, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and education.

Design, Setting, and Participants  Analysis of data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional, nationally representative health examination survey of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population that includes measured weight and height.

Exposures  Survey period.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Prevalence of obesity (body mass index ≥30) and class 3 obesity (body mass index ≥40).

Results  This report is based on data from 2638 adult men (mean age, 46.8 years) and 2817 women (mean age, 48.4 years) from the most recent 2 years (2013-2014) of NHANES and data from 21 013 participants in previous NHANES surveys from 2005 through 2012. For the years 2013-2014, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 37.7% (95% CI, 35.8%-39.7%); among men, it was 35.0% (95% CI, 32.8%-37.3%); and among women, it was 40.4% (95% CI, 37.6%-43.3%). The corresponding prevalence of class 3 obesity overall was 7.7% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.3%); among men, it was 5.5% (95% CI, 4.0%-7.2%); and among women, it was 9.9% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.3%). Analyses of changes over the decade from 2005 through 2014, adjusted for age, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and education, showed significant increasing linear trends among women for overall obesity (P = .004) and for class 3 obesity (P = .01) but not among men (P = .30 for overall obesity; P = .14 for class 3 obesity).

Conclusions and Relevance  In this nationally representative survey of adults in the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in 2013-2014 was 35.0% among men and 40.4% among women. The corresponding values for class 3 obesity were 5.5% for men and 9.9% for women. For women, the prevalence of overall obesity and of class 3 obesity showed significant linear trends for increase between 2005 and 2014; there were no significant trends for men. Other studies are needed to determine the reasons for these trends.",1
"ABSTRACT
Genotype data from dairy cattle selection programs have greatly facilitated GWAS to identify variants related to economic traits. Results can enhance the accuracy of genomic prediction, analyze more complex models that go beyond additive effects, elucidate the genetic architecture of a trait, and finally, decipher the underlying biology of traits. The entire process, comprising data generation, quality control, statistical analyses, interpretation of association results, and linking results to biology should be designed and executed to minimize the generation of false-positive and false-negative associations and misleading links to biological processes. This review aims to provide general guidelines for data analysis that address data quality control, association tests, adjustment for population stratification, and significance evaluation to improve the reliability of conclusions. We also provide guidance on post-GWAS strategy and the interpretation of results. These guidelines are tailored to dairy cattle, which are characterized by long-range linkage disequilibrium, large half-sib families, and routinely collected phenotypes, requiring different approaches than those applied in human GWAS. We discuss common limitations and challenges that have been overlooked in the analysis and interpretation of GWAS to identify candidate sequence variants in dairy cattle.",1

Background: 
The aim of this study was to check the effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation on the disease activity of Vitamin D-deficient systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients.

Materials and Methods: 
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 45 Vitamin D-deficient SLE patients were studied in two groups, namely interventional and placebo groups. The interventional group patients were treated with Vitamin D (50,000 unit/weekly Vitamin D for 12 weeks and then 50,000 unit/monthly for 3 months) and placebo group patients were only administered the placebo. The level of Vitamin D and the level of disease activity using SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) were measured before and after intervention period in each group, and for intra- and between-groups comparison, we used t-test and repeated measure ANOVA.

Results: 
A total of 90 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean of Vitamin D was increased significantly after therapy in interventional group (17.36 ± 4.26 ng/ml vs. 37.69 ± 5.92 ng/ml, P < 0.001). The mean of Vitamin D had no significant difference before and after intervention in placebo group (16.78 ± 4.39 ng/ml vs. 16.62 ± 4.61 ng/ml, P = 0.53). The mean of disease activity (SLEDAI) was not different significantly before and after Vitamin D administration in interventional group (3.09 vs. 1.62 ± 1.25, P = 0.39). The mean of disease activity (SLEDAI) was not different significantly before and after intervention in placebo group (3.09 vs. 1.98 ± 2.47, P = 0.42).

Conclusion: 
According to our study, it is suggested that using Vitamin D in patients with SLE could not have better outcomes in this regard. However, there are many unknown environmental or biological factors which are associated with the disease activity of SLE and have not been identified yet.",1

Background
Inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system are recommended as the first-line medications for diabetic hypertensive patients. However, there is less evidence supporting this recommendation especially among East Asians, a population with a unique distribution of cardiovascular disease compared to the Western population.
Methods and results
The NAGOYA HEART Study is a prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint study to compare an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan, and a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, regarding their efficacies on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Japanese hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance. Of 1168 eligible patients, we enrolled 1150 patients from October 2004 to January 2009. The participants will be followed for more than a median follow-up period of 3 years. The primary composite endpoint includes myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and admission due to congestive heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Any of these events are adjudicated by an independent committee under blinded information regarding the treatment arm. Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, changes in glucose tolerance status, kidney function, left ventricular structure measured by echocardiogram, and incident atrial fibrillation/flutter. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00129233.
Conclusion
The NAGOYA HEART Study will provide us with a relevant insight for appropriate treatment of hypertension with glucose intolerance.",1
"Abstract
Background/Objectives: Sweet taste preferences are currently targeted to aid with reducing free sugar intakes, but associations between sweet taste liking, sweet food intakes, and sugar intakes are not well established. Methods: UK consumers (n = 179) who were consuming >5% of total energy intakes from free sugars provided several laboratory measures of sweet taste liking, laboratory test meal measures of sweet food choice and sugar intakes, and 3-day food diary measures of free-living free sugar and total sugar intakes. Liking measures included liking for a 1 M sucrose solution, and pleasantness, desire to eat, and sweet taste intensity ratings for seven foods of a range of sweet taste intensities in a taste test. Results: Wide individual differences in sweet taste liking, in liking for a high sweet taste intensity, and in the relationships between sweet taste intensity and sweet taste liking were found. The majority of participants confirmed high liking and increasing liking for increasingly sweet tastes, but differing patterns of responses were also found. Higher liking for sweet foods was associated with increased sweet food selection and consumption at the test meal, and to some degree with free sugar and total sugar consumption in this restricted scenario. However, we found no associations between sweet taste liking, regardless of measure, and either free-living free sugar or total sugar intakes. Conclusions: These findings cast doubt on assumptions that sweet taste preferences are high for all and that these high sweet taste preferences drive high free sugar intakes.

"Background The alginate–antacid Gaviscon Double Action (Gaviscon DA) has a combined acid-neutralizing and refluxsuppressing action. Response to treatment in a symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) population has not yet
been tested in a large-scale clinical study.
Aim The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Gaviscon DA compared with matched placebo tablets in the
reduction of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with GERD.
Participants and methods In this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adults with GERD
symptoms (N=424) received Gaviscon DA or placebo tablets for 7 days. The primary endpoint was a clinically important
reduction of at least 1.5 points in the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) GERD dimension (combined heartburn/regurgitation)
between baseline and the end of the treatment. Secondary endpoints included the change in RDQ score from baseline for
individual RDQ dimensions and Overall Treatment Evaluation.
Results A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with Gaviscon DA met the primary endpoint compared with placebo
(47.8 vs. 33.2%, respectively, P=0.0031; odds ratio: 1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–2.78). A significant treatment effect
was also observed for heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia individually. Patients in the Gaviscon DA group rated their overall
treatment response greater than patients in the placebo group [mean Overall Treatment Evaluation (SD): 3.2 (3.08) vs. 2.2 (3.34);
P< 0.001]. No notable differences in the incidence of adverse events were observed between treatments.
Conclusion The alginate–antacid combination, Gaviscon DA, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment to reduce reflux
symptoms and associated dyspepsia in symptomatic GERD patients. Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 31:86–93

"Introduction: In 2018, the first Medically Supervised Injecting Room in Melbourne, Australia was
officially opened. This study assessed whether this facility attracted people who inject drugs, who
were socially vulnerable, and who engaged in drug-related behaviors associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of the frequency of Medically Supervised Injecting
Room use during the first 18 months after opening (July 2018−December 2019) among 658 people
who inject drugs participating in the Melbourne Injecting Drug User Cohort Study (SuperMIX). To
examine the differences between no Medically Supervised Injecting Room use, infrequent use (<50%
injections within the facility), and frequent use (≥50% of injections within the facility), RRRs were estimated using bivariate multinomial logistic regression analyses and postestimation Wald tests. Analyses
were conducted in 2020.
Results: A total of 451 participants (68%) reported no Medically Supervised Injecting Room use, 142
(22%) reported infrequent use, and 65 (10%) reported frequent use. Participants who reported either
infrequent or frequent use of the facility were more socially vulnerable (e.g., more often homeless) and
more likely to report risky drug-related behaviors and poor health outcomes than those who reported
no use. Participants who reported frequent use of the facility were also more likely to live close to the
facility than those reporting infrequent use.
Conclusions: The Melbourne Medically Supervised Injecting Room attracted socially marginalized
people who inject drugs who are most at risk of harms related to injecting drug use and therefore
who are most in need of the service. To determine the long-term impact use of this facility on key
health outcomes such as overdose, future studies should consider the differences in vulnerability
and risk behavior of people who inject drugs who use the Medically Supervised Injecting Room
when examining the outcomes associated with the use of the facility.

"Summary
Background
In addition to their key role in hemostasis, platelets and megakaryocytes regulate immune and inflammatory responses, in part through their expression of Toll‐like receptors (TLRs). Among the TLRs, TLR3 recognizes dsRNA associated with viral infection. Thrombocytopenia is a frequent complication of viral infection. However, the expression and functionality of TLR3 in megakaryocytes and platelets is not yet well understood.
Objective
To study the expression and functionality of TLR3 in the megakaryocytic lineage.
Methods and results
RT‐PCR, flow cytometric and immunofluorescence assays showed that TLR3 is expressed in CD34+ cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets. Immunoblotting assays showed that stimulation of megakaryocytes with two synthetic agonists of TLR3, Poly(I:C) and Poly(A:U), activated the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB), phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal‐related kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 pathways. TLR3–megakaryocyte activation resulted in reduced platelet production in vitro and interferon‐β release through the PI3K–Akt and NF‐κB signaling pathways. TLR3 ligands potentiated the aggregation mediated by classic platelet agonists. This effect was also observed for ATP release, but not for P‐selectin or CD40L membrane exposure, indicating that TLR3 activation was not involved in α‐granule release. In addition, TLR3 agonists induced activation of the NF‐κB, PI3K–Akt and ERK1/2 pathways in platelets. Reductions in platelet production and platelet fibrinogen binding mediated by Poly(I:C) or Poly(A:U) were prevented by the presence of an inhibitor of the TLR3–dsRNA complex.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that functional TLR3 is expressed in CD34+ cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets, and suggest a potential role for this receptor in the megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis alterations that occur in viral infections.",1
"Abstract
Objectives
Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with increased mortality and morbidity rates due to acute renal failure (ARF). Oxidative stress induced with renal I/R injury directly affects glomerular and tubular epithelium through reactive oxygen species. Several studies have been directed to the treatment of renal I/R injury. The aim of this study was to test the attenuation with silymarin (SM) treatment of renal I/R injury-induced morphological changes in the rat kidney.

Methods
A total of 32 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated in four groups. Group I (sham), Group II (renal I/R), Group III (renal I/R injury + SM 50 mg per kg) and Group IV (renal I/R injury + SM 100 mg per kg) were designed to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of SM on the morphological changes of renal I/R injury. Renal I/R injury were induced with left renal pedicle occlusion for 45 min followed with reperfusion for 6 h under anesthesia. After induction of I/R injury, left nephrectomies were performed for histopathological examinations.

Results
After renal I/R injury, significant tubular dilatation, tubular vacuolization, pelvic inflammation, interstitial inflammation, perirenal adipose infiltration, tubular necrosis and glomerular necrosis (cortical necrosis) were observed. However, even with low dose SM in Group III (50 mg per kg SM), histopathological changes due to I/R injury were prevented.

Conclusions
The results of this study have demonstrated that SM significantly prevents renal I/R injury-induced renal tubular changes in the rat. SM in 50 mg/kg was observed to be sufficient to significantly prevent renal tubular necrosis. Further, to our literature knowledge, this is the first specific study to demonstrate the preventive effect of SM on renal I/R injury.

"Abstract. To estimate the extent of the release of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1
(PAI-1) from platelets following their accidental activation in vitro during blood collection,
we studied the antigen levels of PAI-1 and p-thromboglobulin (PTG) in plasma and sera from
38 healthy volunteers. For each volunteer, we calculated the ratio of platelet-derived PAI-1/
platelet-derived PTG from the difference in their respective concentrations in serum and
plasma. The mean ± SD (0.012 ± 0.003) and median (0.012) ratios were identical before
and after 10 or 20 min of venous occlusion. The platelet contribution of PAI-1 in plasma was
estimated by multiplying the plasma concentration of pTG (as a marker of platelet activation) with the above-mentioned individual ratio. Under our conditions of blood collection
(>/,0 vol of 0.1 M citrate, pH 4.5, as anticoagulant, and handling of blood at 4 °C and within
30 min), the platelet contribution to the PAI-1 concentration in plasma was on average 12%
and always negligible in plasma with high levels of PAI-1",1
"Abstract
Aims and objectives
To evaluate and quantify the best available evidence regarding risk factors for severe perineal lacerations.

Background
Many studies have evaluated the risk factors for severe perineal lacerations. However, the results of those studies are inconsistent, and meta-analysis which thoroughly evaluates the risk factors for severe perineal lacerations is still lacking.

Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies based on the PRISMA guideline.

Methods
PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP and SinoMed were systematically searched for cohort studies reporting at least one risk factor for severe perineal lacerations from 1 January 2000 to 2 June 2021. Two reviewers independently conducted quality appraisal by NOS scale and extracted data. Data synthesis was conducted via RevMan 5.3 using a random-effects or fixed-effects model.

Results
A total of 47 studies with 7,043,218 women were included. The results showed that prior caesarean delivery (OR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.12–1.92) and pre-pregnant underweight (OR: 1.31, 95% CI 1.22–1.41) significantly increased the risk of severe perineal lacerations. The results also demonstrated that episiotomy was protective against severe perineal lacerations in forceps delivery (OR: 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.74), but not spontaneous vaginal delivery (OR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.81–2.07) or vacuum delivery (OR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.45–1.28). Nulliparity, foetus in occipitoposterior or occipitotransverse position, and midline episiotomy were also independent risk factors for severe perineal lacerations.

Conclusions
Severe perineal lacerations are associated with many factors, and evidence-based risk assessment tools are needed to guide the midwives and obstetricians to estimate women's risk of severe perineal lacerations.

"Abstract: Aims. The transradial approach (TRA) in coronary
angiography is used less frequently than the transfemoral approach;
the learning curve and transradial failure (TRF) have slowed its widespread use. We evaluate the incidence, causes, and predictors of TRF
in TRA coronary angiographies in an unselected population. Methods
and Results. All elective coronary angiographies using TRA from January 2002 to December 2009 were analyzed in this single-center, prospective, observational study. TRF occurred in 465/8463 procedures
(5.5%). The main causes of TRF were puncture failure in 48.3% and
tortuous brachiocephalic arteries in 22.8% of cases. The annual TRF
percentage decreased from 9.1% in 2002 to 4.1% in 2009 (P<.001).
In a multivariable regression model, the independent factors associated
with TRF included use of >3 catheters (odds ratio [OR], 3.973; confidence interval [CI], 3.198-4.937), abnormal Allen test (OR, 3.231;
CI, 1.839-5.676), radial spasm (OR, 3.896; CI, 2.903-5.229), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 1.900; CI, 1.426-2.532), female sex (OR,
1.451; CI, 1.094-1.925), and age >80 years (OR, 1.441; CI, 1.020-
2.036). Intra-arterial administration of verapamil (OR, 0.137; CI,
0.098-0.190) and nitroglycerin (OR, 0.455; CI, 0.317-0.653), and
height (OR, 0.974; CI, 0.959-0.990) reduced the risk of TRF. Conclusions. Experience with TRA was associated with a low incidence of
TRF. Independent factors associated with TRF were identified.

"Abstract
Background. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and drugs in the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With document quality evaluations and data extraction, Network Meta-Analysis was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. Results. A total of 29 studies (n = 9369) were included; 19 were high-quality studies, and 10 were low-quality studies. NMA showed the following: (1) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is acupuncture, sham acupuncture, pinaverium bromide, alosetron = eluxadoline, ramosetron, and rifaximin; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of severity of side effects in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is rifaximin, alosetron, ramosetron = pinaverium bromide, sham acupuncture, and acupuncture; and (3) the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome includes common acupoints such as ST25, ST36, ST37, SP6, GV20, and EX-HN3. Conclusion. Acupuncture may improve diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome better than drugs and has the fewest side effects. Sham acupuncture may have curative effect except for placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform highly qualified research to prove this result. Pinaverium bromide also has good curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.",1
"Abstract
NaCT mediates citrate uptake in the liver cell line HepG2. When these cells were exposed to iron (Fe3+), citrate uptake/binding as monitored by the association of [14C]-citrate with cells increased. However, there was no change in NaCT expression and function, indicating that NaCT was not responsible for this Fe3+-induced citrate uptake/binding. Interestingly however, the process exhibited substrate selectivity and saturability as if the process was mediated by a transporter. Notwithstanding these features, subsequent studies demonstrated that the iron-induced citrate uptake/binding did not involve citrate entry into cells; instead, the increase was due to the formation of citrate-Fe3+ chelate that adsorbed to the cell surface. Surprisingly, the same phenomenon was observed in culture wells without HepG2 cells, indicating the adsorption of the citrate-Fe3+ chelate to the plastic surface of culture wells. We used this interesting phenomenon as a simple screening technique for new iron chelators with the logic that if another iron chelator is present in the assay system, it would compete with citrate for binding to Fe3+ and prevent the formation and adsorption of citrate-Fe3+ to the culture well. This technique was validated with the known iron chelators deferiprone and deferoxamine, and with the bacterial siderophore 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid and the catechol carbidopa.",1
"Abstract
Background
Actinobacteria from freshwater habitats have been explored less than from other habitats in the search for compounds of pharmaceutical value. This study highlighted the abundance of actinobacteria from freshwater sediments of two rivers and one lake, and the isolates were studied for their ability to produce antimicrobial bioactive compounds.

Results
16S rRNA gene sequencing led to the identification of 84 actinobacterial isolates separated into a common genus (Streptomyces) and eight rare genera (Nocardiopsis, Saccharopolyspora, Rhodococcus, Prauserella, Amycolatopsis, Promicromonospora, Kocuria and Micrococcus). All strains that showed significant inhibition potentials were found against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeast pathogens. Further, three biosynthetic genes, polyketide synthases type II (PKS II), nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and aminodeoxyisochorismate synthase (phzE), were detected in 38, 71 and 29% of the strains, respectively. Six isolates based on their antimicrobial potentials were selected for the detection and quantification of standard antibiotics using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC–ESI–MS/MS) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Four antibiotics (fluconazole, trimethoprim, ketoconazole and rifampicin) and 35 VOCs were quantified and determined from the methanolic crude extract of six selected Streptomyces strains.

Conclusion
Infectious diseases still remain one of the leading causes of death globally and bacterial infections caused millions of deaths annually. Culturable actinobacteria associated with freshwater lake and river sediments has the prospects for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites.",1
"Summary Claudins are major tight junction proteins that regulate the integrity and function of tight
junctions. Aberrant expression of claudins has been shown in various carcinomas with diverse prognostic
implications. However, their expression pattern and prognostic value have not been investigated in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This is the first study to characterize the expression pattern of claudins 1, 4, and 7
in a cohort of 176 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a minimum follow-up of 9.4 years.
Immunohistochemistry with semiquantitative assessment of expression of claudins 1, 4, and 7 was
performed on 176 biopsy specimens. Results were correlated with sex, age, extent of tumor, lymph node
status, the presence or absence of distant metastasis, and patient survival. High expression of claudins 1 and 4
(72.2% and 88.1%) and low expression of claudin 7 (82.4%) were frequently detected. Low claudin 4
expression (P = .020) and high claudin 7 expression (P b .001) were associated with distant metastasis.
Elevated claudin 7 expression also correlated with high tumor stage (P = .001). Furthermore, decreased
claudin 4 expression (P = .003) and increased claudin 7 expression (P b .001) independently predicted
shorter distant metastasis-free survival by Cox regression analysis. Claudin 4 and claudin 7 may be a novel
biomarker for the prediction of distant metastasis and unfavorable prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Background
Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown inverse associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk.
Methods
In a multicenter trial in Spain, we assigned 7447 participants (55 to 80 years of age, 57% women) who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was a major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the trial was stopped on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis. In 2013, we reported the results for the primary end point in the Journal. We subsequently identified protocol deviations, including enrollment of household members without randomization, assignment to a study group without randomization of some participants at 1 of 11 study sites, and apparent inconsistent use of randomization tables at another site. We have withdrawn our previously published report and now report revised effect estimates based on analyses that do not rely exclusively on the assumption that all the participants were randomly assigned.
Results
A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants; there were 96 events in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (3.8%), 83 in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (3.4%), and 109 in the control group (4.4%). In the intention-to-treat analysis including all the participants and adjusting for baseline characteristics and propensity scores, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.91) for a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95) for a Mediterranean diet with nuts, as compared with the control diet. Results were similar after the omission of 1588 participants whose study-group assignments were known or suspected to have departed from the protocol.
Conclusions
In this study involving persons at high cardiovascular risk, the incidence of major cardiovascular events was lower among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts than among those assigned to a reduced-fat diet.

"Abstract
Background
Dynamic interspinous spacers, such as X-stop, Coflex, DIAM, and Aperius, are widely used for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. However, controversy remains as to whether dynamic interspinous spacer use is superior to traditional decompressive surgery.

Methods
Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched during August 2013. A track search was performed on February 27, 2014. Study was included in this review if it was: (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or non-randomized prospective comparison study, (2) comparing the clinical outcomes for interspinous spacer use versus traditional decompressive surgery, (3) in a minimum of 30 patients, (4) with a follow-up duration of at least 12 months.

Results
Two RCTs and three non-randomized prospective studies were included, with 204 patients in the interspinous spacer (IS) group and 217 patients in the traditional decompressive surgery (TDS) group. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference between the IS and TDS groups for low back pain (WMD: 1.2; 95% CI: −10.12, 12.53; P = 0.03; I2 = 66%), leg pain (WMD: 7.12; 95% CI: −3.88, 18.12; P = 0.02; I2 = 70%), ODI (WMD: 6.88; 95% CI: −14.92, 28.68; P = 0.03; I2 = 79%), RDQ (WMD: −1.30, 95% CI: −3.07, 0.47; P = 0.00; I2 = 0%), or complications (RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 0.61, 3.14; P = 0.23; I2 = 28%). The TDS group had a significantly lower incidence of reoperation (RR: 3.34; 95% CI: 1.77, 6.31; P = 0.60; I2 = 0%).

Conclusion
Although patients may obtain some benefits from interspinous spacers implanted through a minimally invasive technique, interspinous spacer use is associated with a higher incidence of reoperation and higher cost. The indications, risks, and benefits of using an interspinous process device should be carefully considered before surgery.

"Summary
Background
The prevalence of diabetes has increased in the UK and other high-income countries alongside a substantial decline in cardiovascular mortality. Yet data are scarce on how these trends have changed the causes of death in people with diabetes who have traditionally died primarily of vascular causes. We estimated how all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in people with diabetes have changed over time, how the composition of the mortality burden has changed, and how this composition compared with that of the non-diabetes population.
Methods
In this epidemiological analysis of primary care records, we identified 313 907 individuals with diabetes in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a well described primary care database, between 2001 to 2018, and linked these data to UK Office for National Statistics mortality data. We assembled serial cross sections with longitudinal follow-up to generate a mixed prevalence and incidence study population of patients with diabetes. We used discretised Poisson regression models to estimate annual death rates for deaths from all causes and 12 specific causes for men and women with diabetes. We also identified age-matched and sex matched (1:1) individuals without diabetes from the same dataset and estimated mortality rates in this group.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2001, and Oct 31, 2018, total mortality declined by 32% in men and 31% in women with diagnosed diabetes. Death rates declined from 40·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 27·8 deaths per 1000 person-years in men and from 42·7 deaths per 1000 person-years to 29·5 deaths per 1000 person-years in women with diagnosed diabetes. We found similar declines in individuals without diabetes, hence the gap in mortality between those with and without diabetes was maintained over the study period. Cause-specific death rates declined in ten of the 12 cause groups, with exceptions in dementia and liver disease, which increased in both populations. The large decline in vascular disease death rates led to a transition from vascular causes to cancers as the leading contributor to death rates in individuals with diagnosed diabetes and to the gap in death rates between those with and without diabetes.
Interpretation
The decline in vascular death rates has been accompanied by a diversification of causes in individuals with diagnosed diabetes and a transition from vascular diseases to cancers as the leading contributor to diabetes-related death. Clinical and preventative approaches must reflect this trend to reduce the excess mortality risk in individuals with diabetes.",1

ABSTRACT
Ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) and ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) MICs were evaluated for a collection of 309 beta-lactam-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered from three institutions in the area of Los Angeles, CA. Overall, 12.0% of isolates were susceptible to imipenem, 15.9% were susceptible to meropenem, 20.7% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam, 24.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime, 25.9% were susceptible to cefepime, 72.5% were susceptible to C/T, and 61.8% were susceptible to CZA. Among C/T-resistant isolates, 9.1% were CZA susceptible, whereas 36.4% of CZA-resistant isolates were susceptible to C/T.",1
"Abstract
Background: Use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) has been associated with increased risk of breast cancer in some, but not all, studies. Differences in reported associations from prior studies may be due, in part, to inadequate control of confounding factors.

Methods: Participants were 28,561 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative who reported use of either CCBs or other antihypertensive medications (AHMs) at baseline; 1,402 incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed during 12 years of follow-up. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between CCB use relative to other AHM use and breast cancer risk.

Results: Use of CCBs was not associated with breast cancer risk (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20) relative to use of other AHMs. Associations approximated the null value when CCBs were considered by duration of use, length of action, or drug class.

Conclusions: We provide additional evidence that CCBs do not influence breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women.

Impact: The results from this study, which includes strong control for potential confounding factors, cast doubt on increases in risk with CCBs. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(8); 1345–8. ©2017 AACR.",1
"Abstract
Wild species of crops serve as a valuable germplasm resource for breeding of modern cultivars. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a vital global staple food. However, research on genome evolution and diversity of wild rice species remains limited. Here, we present nearly complete genomes of 13 representative wild rice species. By integrating with four previously published genomes for pangenome analysis, a total of 101,723 gene families are identified across the genus, including 9834 (9.67%) core gene families. Additionally, 63,881 gene families absent in cultivated rice species but present in wild rice species are discovered. Extensive structural rearrangements, sub-genomes exchanges, widespread allelic variations, and regulatory sequence variations are observed in wild rice species. Interestingly, expanded but less diverse disease resistance genes in the genomes of cultivated rice, likely due to the loss of some resistance genes and the fixing and amplification of genes encoding resistance genes to specific diseases during domestication and artificial selection. This study not only reveals natural variations valuable for gene-level studies and breeding selection but also enhances our understanding on rice evolution and domestication.",1
"The kinesin-2 family motor KIF3A/B works together with dynein to bidirectionally transport intraflagellar particles, melanosomes, and neuronal vesicles. Compared with kinesin-1, kinesin-2 is less processive, and its processivity is more sensitive to load, suggesting that processivity may be controlled by different gating mechanisms. We used stopped-flow and steady-state kinetics experiments, along with single-molecule and multimotor assays to characterize the entire kinetic cycle of a KIF3A homodimer that exhibits motility similar to that of full-length KIF3A/B. Upon first encounter with a microtubule, the motor rapidly exchanges both mADP and mATP. When adenosine 5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate was used to entrap the motor in a two-head-bound state, exchange kinetics were unchanged, indicating that rearward strain in the two-head-bound state does not alter nucleotide binding to the front head. A similar lack of front head gating was found when intramolecular strain was enhanced by shortening the neck linker domain from 17 to 14 residues. In single-molecule assays in ADP, the motor dissociates at 2.1 s−1, 20-fold slower than the stepping rate, demonstrating the presence of rear head gating. In microtubule pelleting assays, the KDMt is similar in ADP and ATP. The data and accompanying simulations suggest that, rather than KIF3A processivity resulting from strain-dependent regulation of nucleotide binding (front head gating), the motor spends a significant fraction of its hydrolysis cycle in a low affinity state but dissociates only slowly from this state. This work provides a mechanism to explain differences in the load-dependent properties of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2.",1
"Abstract
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is important for tumor initiation and progression. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is an essential Wnt co-receptor for Wnt/β-catenin signaling and represents a promising anticancer target. Recently, the antihelminthic drug, niclosamide was found to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although the mechanism was not well defined. We found that niclosamide was able to suppress LRP6 expression and phosphorylation, block Wnt3A-induced β-catenin accumulation, and inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on LRP6 expression/phosphorylation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling were conformed in human prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells. Moreover, we showed that the mechanism by which niclosamide suppressed LRP6 resulted from increased degradation as evident by a shorter half-life. Finally, we demonstrated that niclosamide was able to induce cancer cell apoptosis, and displayed excellent anticancer activity with IC50 values less than 1 µM for prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells. The IC50 values are comparable to those shown to suppress the activities of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells. Our data indicate that niclosamide is a unique small molecule Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor targeting the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 on the cell surface, and that niclosamide has a potential to be developed a novel chemopreventive or therapeutic agent for human prostate and breast cancer.",1

Methods
In this work we used a modification of the mouse model for
measuring iron excretion previously used in this laboratory [13].
The mice were overloaded with iron dextran given intraperitoneally at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. The iron stores were then radiolabelled with (59Fe)-lactoferrin. This treatment preferentially delivers iron to the liver [14]. Iron excretion was allowed to equilibrate
for 3 weeks when a plateau was reached. At this stage the mice were
used to measure the 59Fe excretion induced by the test compounds
given either orally or intraperitoneally. Both faeces and urines were
collected separately [15] over defined time periods for a number of
days and the 59Fe excretion was monitored.
The excretion following the administration of each compound
was expressed as a percentage of the counts excreted during the previous 24-hour period. This facilitated the comparison of results between animals even though the total counts showed considerable
variation. A typical excretion pattern is shown in figure 1. The results for each compound were then combined and the linear correa

line constrained to pass through the control value which was defined as 100%. The slopes of the .lines were compared using a onetailed t distribution.
Materials
The bidentate 3-hydroxypyrid-4-ones (fig. 2a) were prepared by
the general method of Mohrle and Weber [16; also see 10, 17]. Benzylmaltol was treated with a range of amines in alkaline aqueous
ethanol solution (pH 12.5) for periods between 6 h and 3 weeks, the
length of time depending on the size of the amine, bulky amines requiring longer reaction times. The resulting benzylpyridones were
isolated as hydrochloride salts, and hydrogenated in the presence
of Pd-charcoal. The 3-hydroxypyrid-4-one hydrochlorides were
recrystallized from aqueous ethanol. Six compounds were synthesized (table I).
The hexadentate ligand, CP130 (fig. 2b) N,N,N-tri[2-(3-hydroxy-2-oxopyrid-l-ylacetamido)]ethylamine was prepared by
conjugation of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine with 3-benzyloxy-l-succinimyloxycarbonylmethyl-pyrid-2-one using the corresponding
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The benzyl-protecting groups were
removed by hydrogenation over a Pd-charcoal catalyst. The ligand
was recrystallized from ethanol.
The purity of the compounds was established to be greater than
99% by elemental analysis and proton nuclear magnetic resonance.",1
"Abstract
Introduction: Angiotensin II (AngII) induces hypertension
and pathophysiological vascular thickening and atherosclerosis. This study aims to validate the effects of Angiopoietinlike 7 (ANGPTL7) in AngII-induced hypertension. Methods:
ANGPTL7 in blood samples were determined by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction. AngII-induced cell
growth were detected by CCK-8. Cell cycle arrest and cell
apoptosis by downregulation of ANGPTL7 were detected by
flow cytometric assay. AngII-induced inflammation was
evaluated by Western blotting and ELISA. Results: ANGPTL7
was highly expressed in patients with hypertension. AngII
promoted cell viability and the expression level of ANGPTL7
in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Downregulation of
ANGPTL7 inhibited AngII-induced cell proliferation and cell
inflammation. Moreover, ANGPTL7 expression decreases
also promoted cell apoptosis. Conclusions: Downregulation
of ANGPTL7 reversed AngII-induced cell proliferation and
cell inflammation and promoted apoptosis in AngII-induced
VSMC cells. Therefore, ANGPTL7 can be a potential target in
AngII-induced hypertension. ",1
"Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is emblematic of unresolved
heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders— the variation in biological, clinical, and psychological
correlates that impedes progress on etiology. One approach to this problem is to characterize
subgroups using measures rooted in biological or psychological theory, consistent with NIMH’s
RDoC initiative. Within ADHD, a promising application involves using emotion trait profiles
that can address the role of irritability as a complicating feature for ADHD. Here, a new sample
of 186 children with ADHD was evaluated using community detection analysis to determine if
meaningful subprofiles existed and if they replicated those previously identified. The new
sample and a prior sample were pooled for evaluation of a) method dependence, b) longitudinal
assessment of the stability of classifications, and c) clinical prediction two years later. Three
temperament profiles were confirmed within the ADHD group: one with normative emotional
functioning (“Mild”), one with high surgency (“Surgent”), and one with high negative affect
(“Irritable”). Profiles were similar across statistical clustering approaches. The Irritable group
had the highest external validity: it was moderately stable over time and it enhanced prospective
prediction of clinical outcomes beyond standard baseline indicators. The Irritable group was not
reducible to ADHD+ODD, ADHD+DMDD, or other patterns of comorbidity. Among the
negative affect domains studied, trait proneness to anger uniquely contributed to clinical
prediction. Results extend our understanding of chronic irritability in psychiatric disorders and
provide prospects for a fresh approach to assessing ADHD heterogeneity focused on the
distinction between ADHD with and without anger/irritability.

"Abstract
Objectives: The authors present 3 cases of various pathologically confirmed malignancies (one gallbladder, one periampullary, and one liver). These patients underwent Psorinum therapy as the primary cancer treatment. Psorinum therapy is a homeopathic approach to treat patients with cancer.
Subjects: According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, nodes, metastasis system, all 3 patients were diagnosed at Stage IV. Their Karnofsky performance status was between 20% and 50% and their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score status was between 3 and 4. In these cases, conventional cancer treatments could not be initiated due to the advanced stage of their disease, poor general health performance status, and their financial constraints.
Interventions and outcome: In these patients, Psorinum-6x was administered orally at a dose of 0.02 mL/kg body weight/day on an empty stomach for a complete course duration of 2 years, along with allopathic and homeopathic supportive treatment. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, complete tumor response occurred in 1 case and partial tumor response occurred in the other 2 cases. All 3 patients remained alive and maintained a stable quality of life for at least 2 years. The patients reported no adverse side-effects from Psorinum-6x.
Conclusions: This report indicates the clinical efficacy of Psorinum therapy in treating those 3 patients. Thorough basic research and well-designed clinical trials should be conducted for further investigation of this homeopathic cancer treatment in order to integrate it into the mainstream of oncology treatments.",1
"The decoy state protocol has been considered to be one of the most important methods to protect
the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) with a weak coherent source. Here we test two
experimental approaches to generating the decoy states with different intensities: modulation of
the pump current of a semiconductor laser diode, and external modulation by an optical intensity
modulator. The former approach shows a side-channel in the time domain that allows an attacker to
distinguish s signal state from a decoy state, breaking a basic assumption in the protocol. We model
a photon-number-splitting attack based on our experimental data, and show that it compromises the
system’s security. Then, based on the work of K. Tamaki et al. [New J. Phys. 18, 065008 (2016)],
we obtain two analytical formulas to estimate the yield and error rate of single-photon pulses when
the signal and decoy states are distinguishable. The distinguishability reduces the secure key rate
below that of a perfect decoy-state protocol. To mitigate this reduction, we propose to calibrate
the transmittance of the receiver (Bob’s) unit. We apply our method to three QKD systems and
estimate their secure key rates",1
"Recent studies have shown that application of conductive materials including magnetite and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can promote the methanogenic decomposition of short-chain fatty acids and even more complex organic matter in anaerobic digesters and natural habitats. The linkage to microbial identity and the mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the effects of nanoscale magnetite (nanoFe3O4) and multiwalled CNTs on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate in an enrichment obtained from lake sediment. The microbial populations were composed mainly of Smithella, Syntrophomonas, Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina and Methanoregula. In addition to acetate, butyrate was transiently accumulated indicating that propionate was oxidized by Smithella via the dismutation pathway and part of the leaked butyrate was oxidized by Syntrophomonas. Propionate oxidation and CH4 production were significantly accelerated in the presence of nanoFe3O4 and CNTs. While propionate oxidation was suppressed upon H2 application and suspended completely upon formate application in the control, this suppressive effect was substantially compromised in the presence of nanoFe3O4 and CNTs. The tests on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of a pure culture methanogen and of the enrichment culture without propionate showed negative effect by both materials. The positive effect of nanoFe3O4 disappeared when it was insulated by surface-coating with silica. Observations made with fluorescence in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscope indicated the extensive formation of microbial cell-conductive material mixture aggregates. Our results suggest that direct interspecies electron transfer is likely activated by the conductive materials and operates in concert with H2/formate-dependent electron transfer for syntrophic propionate oxidation in the sediment enrichment.",1
"Abstract
Exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induces acute colitis, which is normally resolved after DSS removal. To study chronicity, mice are typically subjected to three to five cycles of weekly DSS exposures, each followed by a 1- to 2-wk rest period. Here, we describe a novel and convenient way of inducing chronic, progressive colitis by a single exposure to DSS. C57BL/6 mice exposed to DSS for 5 days developed acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation. The plasma haptoglobin levels remained high during the chronic phase, showing that the inflammation was active. Surprisingly, the mice regained their original weight along with the progression of colitis, and the only apparent symptom was loose feces. Histopathological changes 4 wk after DSS removal were dense infiltrates of mononuclear cells, irregular epithelial structure, and persistent deposits of collagen. A progressive production of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-12 p70, and IL-17 correlated with the extensive cellular infiltration, whereas high IFN-γ production was mainly found late in the chronic phase. Similar to C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice exposed to 5 days of DSS developed acute colitis as previously described. The acute colitis was accompanied by elevated plasma levels of haptoglobin and increased colonic levels of IL-1α/β, IL-6, IL-18, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. However, soon after DSS removal, BALB/c mice recovered and were symptom free within 2 wk and completely recovered 4 wk after DSS removal in terms of histopathology, haptoglobin levels, and local cytokine production. In summary, these data stress the effect of genetic background on the outcome of DSS provocation. We believe that the present protocol to induce chronic colitis in C57BL/6 mice offers a robust model for validating future therapies for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",1

Objectives
Using data from a randomized experiment, to examine whether moving youth out of areas of concentrated poverty, where a disproportionate amount of crime occurs, prevents involvement in crime.

Methods
We draw on new administrative data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment. MTO families were randomized into an experimental group offered a housing voucher that could only be used to move to a low-poverty neighborhood, a Section 8 housing group offered a standard housing voucher, and a control group. This paper focuses on MTO youth ages 15–25 in 2001 (n = 4,643) and analyzes intention to treat effects on neighborhood characteristics and criminal behavior (number of violent- and property-crime arrests) through 10 years after randomization.

Results
We find the offer of a housing voucher generates large improvements in neighborhood conditions that attenuate over time and initially generates substantial reductions in violent-crime arrests and sizable increases in property-crime arrests for experimental group males. The crime effects attenuate over time along with differences in neighborhood conditions.

Conclusions
Our findings suggest that criminal behavior is more strongly related to current neighborhood conditions (situational neighborhood effects) than to past neighborhood conditions (developmental neighborhood effects). The MTO design makes it difficult to determine which specific neighborhood characteristics are most important for criminal behavior. Our administrative data analyses could be affected by differences across areas in the likelihood that a crime results in an arrest.",1
"In plants and algae, chloroplast gene expression is controlled by nucleus-encoded proteins that bind to mRNAs in a specific manner, stabilizing mRNAs or promoting their splicing, editing, or translation. Here, we present the characterization of two mRNA stabilization factors of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which both belong to the OctotricoPeptide Repeat (OPR) family. MCG1 is necessary to stabilize the petG mRNA, encoding a small subunit of the cytochrome b6f complex, while MBI1 stabilizes the psbI mRNA, coding for a small subunit of photosystem II. In the mcg1 mutant, the small RNA footprint corresponding to the 5′-end of the petG transcript is reduced in abundance. In both cases, the absence of the small subunit perturbs assembly of the cognate complex. Whereas PetG is essential for formation of a functional cytochrome b6f dimer, PsbI appears partly dispensable as a low level of PSII activity can still be measured in its absence. Thus, nuclear control of chloroplast gene expression is not only exerted on the major core subunits of the complexes, but also on small subunits with a single transmembrane helix. While OPR proteins have thus far been involved in translation or trans-splicing of plastid mRNAs, our results expand the potential roles of this repeat family to their stabilization.",1
"Abstract
The potential release of Pb, Zn, Cr, and Cu in municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ash was investigated by batch leaching experiments using sodium acetate solution as the extractant. The concentrations of heavy metals decreased against the increase of liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio with the exception of Zn. In the case of low L/S ratios, the concentration of Pb and Zn was relatively high. Leaching solvents with a wide pH range (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) were used to determine the acid neutralizing capacity of MSWI fly ash. The concentrations of heavy metals declined evidently along with the increase of initial pH of leaching solvent when the L/S ratio was fixed at 20. The turning point appeared at the pH value close to 6. When the pH value was higher than 6, the concentrations of heavy metals remained at a low level. Sequential extraction tests were also performed to reveal the long-term leaching behavior. The results showed that Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cr were mainly present in the last three fractions, which were Fe-Mn oxides, organic matters bound and residual fractions and their leachability could be well-controlled in common natural environment. However, the long-term leaching risk would be increased with the presence of reducing agents and the change of the pH value of the surrounding environment.",1
"Abstract
Different stress conditions can induce changes in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC
1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6). The enzyme activities of all SOD and APX
isoforms detected in young Arabidopsis leaves remained unaffected or slightly decreased after moderate paraquat treatment. While
CAT2 activity also remained unaffected under these conditions, CAT3 enzyme activity was enhanced. In contrast to the enzyme
activities, mRNA levels of both cat2 and cat3 were enhanced under oxidative stress induced by either paraquat or the fungal toxin
cercosporin. This indicates that, with respect to enzyme activity level, CAT3 is the enzyme which is most sensitive to oxidative
stress in this developmental stage and that the enzyme activity of CAT2 is possibly regulated at the post-transcriptional level.
Interestingly, cat3 mRNA level and CAT3 activity are not elevated by paraquat treatment in senescing leaves. In contrast, the
response to other stress conditions, such as water stress induced by flooding of detached leaves and heat stress, is maintained in
senescing leaves. Since changes in stress response are not a general phenomenon in leaf senescence but appear to be restricted to
oxidative stress, this might be a specific mechanism to promote senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland

Background
There is no clear consensus on the better therapy [radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus hepatic resection (HR)] for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) eligible for surgical treatments. This study is a meta-analysis of the available evidence.

Methods
Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing RFA with HR for small HCC published from 1997 to 2009 in PubMed and Medline. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using either the fixed effects model or random effects model.

Results
One randomized controlled trial, and 9 nonrandomized controlled trials studies were included in this analysis. These studies included a total of 1411 patients: 744 treated with RFA and 667 treated with HR. The overall survival was significantly higher in patients treated with HR than in those treated with RFA at 3 years (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44-0.71), and at 5 year (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.36-1.01). RFA has a higher rates of local intrahepatic recurrence compared to HR (OR: 4.50, 95% CI: 2.45-8.27). In the HR group the 1, 3, and 5 years disease -free survival rates were significantly better than in the HR-treated patients (respectively: OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28-0.68; OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.99). The postoperative morbidity was higher with HR (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.13-0.65), but no significant differences were found concerning mortality. For tumors ≤ 3 cm HR did not differ significantly from RFA for survival, as reported in three NRCTs .

Conclusions
HR was superior to RFA in the treatment of patients with small HCC eligible for surgical treatments, particularly for tumors > 3 cm. However, the findings have to be carefully interpreted due to the lower level of evidence.

"The replication fork helicase in eukaryotic cells is comprised of Cdc45, Mcm2–7, and GINS (CMG complex). In budding yeast, Sld3, Sld2, and Dpb11 are required for the initiation of DNA replication, but Sld3 and Dpb11 do not travel with the replication fork. Sld3 and Cdc45 bind to early replication origins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas Sld2, GINS, polymerase ϵ, and Dpb11 form a transient preloading complex that associates with origins during S phase. We show here that Sld3 binds tightly to origin single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). CDK-phosphorylated Sld3 binds to origin ssDNA with similar high affinity. Origin ssDNA does not disrupt the interaction between Sld3 and Dpb11, and origin ssDNA does not disrupt the interaction between Sld3 and Cdc45. However, origin ssDNA substantially disrupts the interaction between Sld3 and Mcm2–7. GINS and Sld3 compete with one another for binding to Mcm2–7. However, in a mixture of Sld3, GINS, and Mcm2–7, origin ssDNA inhibits the interaction between Sld3 and Mcm2–7, whereas origin ssDNA promotes the association between GINS and Mcm2–7. We also show that origin single-stranded DNA promotes the formation of the CMG complex. We conclude that origin single-stranded DNA releases Sld3 from Mcm2–7, allowing GINS to bind Mcm2–7.",1
"Altered connectivity of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC) and hippocampus during working memory is
considered an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia
(SCZ), but the relevance for other mental disorders with
shared genetic background remains unknown. Here we
investigated its presence in unaffected first-degree relatives
of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive
disorder (MDD). Furthermore, we aimed to provide an
independent replication of this phenotype in first-degree
relatives of SCZ patients. We acquired functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 309 healthy controls
and 218 healthy first-degree relatives of index patients
with SCZ (n = 62), BD (n = 66) and MDD (n = 90), who
completed the n-back working memory paradigm. We
observed a significant group effect on DLPFC–hippocampus coupling (PFWE = .031, all P-values region of interest
[ROI] corrected). Post hoc comparisons revealed that this
effect was driven by the SCZ relatives, who showed a significant increase in the negative functional connectivity of
the DLPFC and right hippocampus compared to controls
(PFWE = .001), BD relatives (PFWE = .015) and trend-wise
also MDD relatives (PFWE = .082). Comparison of BD and
MDD relatives to the controls revealed no difference (PFWEvalues > .451). Supplementary analyses suggested that the
SCZ relatives finding is robust to a range of potential confounds, including structural differences. Our data further
support altered DLPFC–hippocampus connectivity during
working memory as an intermediate phenotype for SCZ.
This suggests that this phenotype is relatively specific to
SCZ and does not translate to other genetically related
disorders in the mood-psychosis spectrum.

"Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are suggested to be responsible for high recurrence rate and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Identifying novel targets that can suppress CSCs proliferation and metastasis may provide novel approach to combat against CRC. In the present study, we examined the role of miR-148a in cisplatin-resistant CRC cells with enhanced stem cell marker expression and explored the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used cisplatin to selectively enrich cisplatin-resistant CRC cells from SW480 cell line, and these selected cisplatin-resistant SW480 cells were with significantly enhanced expression of stem cell markers and increased chemoresistance. MicroRNA (miRNA) array and qRT-PCR assay identified the down-regulation of miR-148a in cisplatin-resistant SW480 cells. Overexpression of miR-148a suppressed expression of stem cell markers, inhibited sphere formation, invasion and migration, induced apoptosis, and reduced chemo-resistance in cisplatin-resistant SW480 cells. Bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay revealed that WNT10b was a downstream target of miR-148a, and overexpression of miR-148a suppressed WNT10b expression and β-catenin signaling activities. Enforced expression WNT10b attenuated the effects of miR-148a on cisplatin-resistant SW480 cells sphere formation, invasion and migration. Further study showed that overexpression of miR-148a also suppressed in vivo tumor growth, and WNT10b expression and β-catenin signaling activities in tumor tissues were suppressed by miR-148a overexpression. In the clinical samples, miR-184a was found to be down-regulated in CRC tissues, down-regulation of miR-148a predicted poor prognosis in CRC patients. In conclusion, our study for the first time enriched the cisplatin-resistant CRC cells with enhanced stem cell marker expression from sphere-forming and chemo-resistant SW480-derived tumor xenografts in immune-deficient mice, and miR-148a suppressed the expression of stem cell markers, increased chemo-sensitivity, cell invasion and migration at least partly via regulating WNT10b and β-catenin signaling pathway.",1
