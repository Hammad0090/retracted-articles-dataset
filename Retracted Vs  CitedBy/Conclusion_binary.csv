"In summary, this work has presented a novel compound, YL-0919, acting as both serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Such pharmacological profile of dual functions may account for its antidepressant-like activity demonstrated in animal models. Future studies are needed to further assess the feasibility of its clinical application in eliciting an efficacious antidepressant response in patients.",0
"Through the means of a systematic review and a focused
meta-analysis, this study reveals that human adults born
preterm have a reduced VO2max and FEV1 independent of
physical activity levels. Consequently, in adults born preterm, exercise interventions may result in a lower beneft
compared with adults born at term, and additional therapeutic interventions or higher exercise intensities/volumes
may be required.

"Concluding Remarks

This study was designed to investigate the hand movement effects on visual word recognition and ERP neural correlates of handwriting effect among L2 learners. The finding that drawing lines/shapes enhances word recognition should be further investigated in future research as our previous study (
Guan et al., 2021b
) showing facilitative effects of drawing straight line on Chinese character recognition and curved-line on English word recognition among typical and dyslexic readers. Moreover, future research should employ various methodologies to examine whether and to what extent hand writing and drawing affect orthographic perception in other bilingual and monolingual groups. For instance, neural correlates of age of acquisition on visual word recognition in L2 learners. Based on the findings of the current study, it is reasonable to argue that writing, as a basic manual sensorimotor skill, directly influences the way in which knowledge of words is acquired (
Van-Hove et al., 2017
). Modes of writing are at the core of human learning. They have a profound influence on learners’ cognitive and language development (
Mangen and Velay, 2010
). The current study further demonstrates the impact of perceptual experiences and sensorimotor interactions with the physical environment on language processing, consistent with theories of embodied cognition (
Smith and Gasser, 2005
).",0
"According to the study’s findings, adult smokers experience vertigo more than non-smokers. Additionally, demographic characteristics have been demonstrated to have a major impact on vertigo, necessitating a discussion of these issues. We anticipate that this study will highlight the need for additional research in the areas of smoking prevention and treatment, as well as the demographic characteristics and their impact on vertigo. Moreover, we need to have health promotion and smoking cessation programs and awareness about the risk of smoking",0
"Within its limitations, the present study concludes that better dentin wettability is seen with Tubli-seal compared to BC sealer. The contact angle was lesser between dentin and sealers used in the root canal for the remaining calcium hydroxide samples. Also, calcium hydroxide can be removed from the polished dentin surface with two minutes of irrigation with 17% EDTA and 6% NaOCl. The limitations of the present study were single-assessment time and a smaller number of included samples, warranting more long-term studies on a greater number of samples.",0

"Conclusions
Considering that green innovation and digital transformation are important ways to achieve carbon peaking and
carbon neutrality in China, this paper uses 452 high energy-consuming listed enterprises as a research sample
and uses a double fxed-efects model to explore the impact efect of green innovation on the carbon emission
reduction performance of high energy-consuming enterprises and the moderating efect of digital transformation. Te fndings show that, frstly, green innovation has a positive efect on the level of carbon emission reduction performance of high energy-consuming enterprises, and the results are robust when tested by endogeneity,
standard error clustering bias and dynamic panel selection bias. Secondly, digital transformation can improve
the contribution of green innovation to the carbon emission reduction performance of high energy-consuming
enterprises. Tird, the heterogeneity of the impact of digital transformation on the relationship between green
innovation and the carbon emission reduction performance of energy-intensive enterprises is due to the differences in the characteristics of industries. Te impact of green innovation and digital transformation on the
processing industry is not yet evident.",0

"We observed an increased probability of a favorable discharge disposition with EVT versus BMM for
patients with BAO and mild neurological deficits in this
representative database of US patients. The higher
rate of favorable discharge with EVT (as a surrogate

null difference in in-hospital mortality and hospitalization duration. However, based on the limitations of the

In order to mitigate the risk for virological failure, it is important to perform targeted clinical assessments and
examinations at every ART clinic visit to identify early clinical signs or symptoms of virological failure. In addition,
it is important that regular education sessions about the risk of virological failure should be provided at each clinic

"This scoping review shows that CBT intervention is one of interventions carried out
by nurses to reduce PTSD symptoms in children who are victims of violence. There are
three methods in the CBT intervention, namely psychoeducation, self-management, and
counseling. CBT interventions have been shown to reduce negative emotional and behavioral responses in children, increase resilience, adaptive coping, stress management, and
increase self-confidence. CBT interventions carried out by nurses must pay attention to the
physical, psychological, spiritual, and cultural conditions of students to optimally reduce
PTSD symptoms in children. Each intervention was adjusted to the characteristics and
severity of the trauma experienced by the respondent. CBT intervention can be the basis for
nurses in providing comprehensive nursing intervention to children as victims of violence.
The results of this study can also be the basis for further research to analyze the effectiveness
of CBT interventions in managing other symptoms that arise due to violence in children",0
"The current study provides evidence for the potential neuroprotective effect of ipriflavone
through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities (Fig 9). Data presented in this study shows that; Ipriflavone (50mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80 ameliorated LPS
induced brain inflammation of adult male rats. The neuroprotective effects of ipriflavone can
be accredited to its anti-inflammatory effect, its ability in alleviating oxidative stress and anticholinesterase effect (Fig 9). Polysorbate 80, possesses high BBB permeability thus, it can be
used for effective brain targeting in neurodegenerative diseases.
It is reasonable to deem that ipriflavone nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 at dose
equivalent to 5mg/kg significantly attenuated LPS-induced brain inflammation whereas free
drug at same dose (5mg/kg) didn’t show the same effect against LPS induction of neuroinflammation. This may be considered as a significant improvement in attenuating neuroinflammation using nanoparticles by decreasing the dose ten times the effective therapeutic dose of free
drug (50 mg/kg) while showing better biochemical results. However, further studies to consider it as a drug delivery system is required.",0

"In conclusion, in this observational study, we found that non-operative management in children for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in selected cases is a safe and effective treatment method. Based on our findings, we propose that the success rate of non-operative management for clinically and radiologically proven acute appendicitis cases could be improved by applying two significant treatment criteria, i.e., less than 24 hours of symptom duration and fever-free at the time of admission.

"We have established herein that, due to the evolving boundary layer and the corresponding area blockage in the
upstream port of any internal nanofuid fow system with sudden expansion or divergent region, the creeping
diabatic nanofow (Mi< <1) originated from the upstream port of the system could accelerate to the supersonic
fow leading to an undesirable phenomenon of pressure-overshoot due to shock wave generation as a result of
the Sanal fow choking. Trough the proposed mathematical methodology, we could disprove the general belief
of the impossibilities of internal fow choking in such real-world nanoscale fuid fow systems at the creeping
infow conditions. Tere was a general belief in the scientifc community over the centuries that the subsonic/
creeping fow would not be augmented up to supersonic fow without passing through a geometric throat, which
we have disproved herein through the closed-form analytical model. Note that if the total-to-static pressure ratio
at the fuid-throat is lower than the LCDI the detonation would not occur even if the blockage factor is relatively
high in nanoscale fuid fow systems. Te physical insight of the nanoscale Sanal fow choking and streamtube
fow choking14 presented in this article sheds light on fnding solutions to numerous unresolved scientifc problems carried forward over the centuries. We concluded that the 3D-boundary-layer-blockage factors presented
herein are universal-benchmark-data for performing high-fdelity in silico, in vitro and in vivo experiments in

"Based on the electric load dispatching model, this paper further considers the dispatching value of heat load
participating in demand response, and establishes an electric-heat integrated demand response model. In order
to verify the validity of the proposed electrothermal comprehensive demand response model, three diferent cases
were set up for simulation comparison analysis. At the same time, in order to verify the superiority of IGWO, the
simulation comparison analysis was carried out with traditional GWO and IPSO, and the results showed that:
(1) When only considering the electric-heat substitution response, the system can cut peaks and fll valleys
within a certain range, but the operating cost is high and the utilization rate of new energy is low.(2) When considering the dispatcher’s expected signal and electric load response, the system can achieve peak
shaving and valley flling, and appropriately increase the electric load demand when the heat demand is
large at night, which can improve the accommodation level of new energy.
(3) When considering the integrated electric and heat demand response of the dispatcher’s desired signal, the
operating cost of the system can be reduced to a greater extent, the utilization rate of new energy can be
improved, and the benign interaction between the source and the load can be promoted.
(4) IGWO can improve the defect of insufcient population diversity in the later stage of evolution, so that
the population diversity can be better maintained during the entire evolution process. While taking into
account the speed of optimization, it improves the algorithm’s ability to jump out of the local optimum and
realizes continuous deep search.
Since the uncertainty on both sides of the source-load afects the reliability and economy of the system
operation, the integrated demand response of the system under multiple uncertainties will be considered in the
subsequent research work.",0
"This meta-analysis is the first to synthesize research on associations between the ERI model and markers of the HPA axis. The
CAR and waking cortisol assessments were most associated
with ERI, whereas cortisol in the afternoon and evening was most
associated with OC, although prospective evidence is required to
confirm these associations. Both ERI and OC were significantly
associated with HPA responsivity. However, because OC moderated the relationship between ERI and HPA axis markers, the importance of OC should not be overlooked. Because OC is likely
more malleable than ERI to intervention, this may be a promising
area of focus for future research. Furthermore, when we consider
that much research has shown the imbalance between workplace
efforts and rewards leads to ill-health, and that the current metaanalysis reports an association between ERI and indicators of
HPA axis dysregulation, altering the structural components of the
workplace that lead to ERI may result in improved employee health.",0

"Advanced laparoscopic training is difficult to come by in a developing nation like India. As a result, approaches with a low learning curve should be used in a variety of advanced laparoscopic operations. We believe that Hem-o-lok® will be a simpler procedure for novices to master, saving operating time. Hem-o-lok® is statistically cheaper than ENDOLOOP®, according to a cost comparison assessment and Hem-o-lok® surgery took less time on average. There were no intra-operative or post-operative problems in the Hem-o-lok® group. Hence, we advocate the use of Hem-o-lok® as a safe, simpler and cost-effective way to ligate an appendicular stump in uncomplicated laparoscopic appendicectomy.

Co3O4 nanoparticles composite was synthesized and used as
an anode material in LIBs. The prepared Co3O4@MnO2 electrode delivered a capacity of 1080 mAh g−1
 at 300 mA g−1
 after
160 cycles and 696 mAh g−1
 at 1 A g−1
 after 210 cycles. The high
energy density, excellent structural stability, and outstanding
electrochemical performance of this composite electrode were
ascribed to the unique structure and the synergetic effect of the
two metal oxides. This work will be of benefit to the design and
controllable synthesis of high-performance LIBs with metaloxide-based electrode materials in the future.",0

"Iron deficiency is common in mothers with PPD who, by
appearance, have normal hemoglobin and serum iron levels
after delivery. Early iron supplementation in these mothers
significantly improves the status of iron stores and causes
a significant reduction in EPDS scores, as well as a significant increase in the improvement rate for PPD. In addition,
continued PPD might be related to the low postpartum ferritin levels in untreated mothers. Based on these results,
iron stores should be evaluated in all mothers with PPD
regardless of anemia and hematologic indices, and when
detecting iron deficiency without anemia, daily iron supplementation should be considered for the early improvement
in PPD and iron stores. However, it is important to note
that these results need to be confirmed by further studies,
as both PPD prevalence and ferritin levels are affected by
socioeconomic, nutritional, and cultural characteristics present within different societies. Additional studies are also
required to evaluate how inflammation and inflammatory
markers after delivery could affect ferritin levels and PPD
symptoms. Furthermore, prospective studies are required to
evaluate the possible side effects of iron supplementation
in these mothers, as well as to assess the clinical effects of
iron supplementation on infants’ colic, breastfeeding, sleep

"The occurrence of phase transition for NaVO2F2 is oen excited

The expected microstructure and structure can be obtained by
controlling the different modes of phase transitions at different

exploited. Therefore, it is very signicant to determine the phase
transition temperature. In the present study, the shi and peak
intensity of Raman characteristic spectra for the NaVO2F2 crystal
change with temperature were analyzed by observing the in situ
Raman spectra, creating a new observation and analysis method
for the phase transition of the NaVO2F2 crystal. The results indicated that different phase transitions occurred near the temperature points of 93 K, 233 K and 453 K during the heating process,
and it was conrmed that the transition from the P21/c phase to
the P21/m phase took place near the temperature point of 453 K,

" The RPH/FPS allows hospital-based clinicians to expand past numerical scores and facial expressions to assess the level of disruption that pain imposes on patients. The RPH/FPS can be used by auxiliary services such as physical therapy and occupational therapy (PT/OT) to glean information about how pain affects function. The care coordinator will also be able to find helpful information regarding the patient's ability to concentrate due to pain, i.e., ""Is now a good time to discuss POC, or is the patient unable to concentrate due to pain."" Auxiliary services are unable to find any of this information using the NPS or any other unidimensional pain scale.

"A new friction reduction technology, termed “earthworm-like drilling” is proposed in this
paper. A mathematical model based on a “soft-string” model is established to verify the technology’s feasibility and advantages. A comparison of three vibration manners reveals that
multi-point vibration drilling is more effective than single-point vibration drilling under the
same conditions. Compared with multi-point simultaneous vibration, the decrease in the friction reduction effect of earthworm-like drilling due to pressure pulse attenuation can be offset
by increasing the number of shakers. The amplitude and frequency of the pulse pressure and
the installation position of the shakers have a substantial impact on friction reduction and the
load transfer effect. Frequency also affects the attenuation and propagation distance of the
pulse pressure aroused by the hydraulic vibrators. In addition, an optimization model based
on the projection gradient method is established and used to optimize the position of three
shakers of a horizontal well. WOB increases significantly after the position optimization. The
new positions of the shakers move toward the bottom of well, and the shakers are close to one
another. Based on the discussion of the feasibility, advantages and influence factors of earthworm-like drilling presented in this paper, earthworm-like drilling is a technology with broad
application prospects.",0

"The present study demonstrates broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of Aspergillus clavatonanicus strain MJ31, against both plant and human pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of
strain MJ31 was established by detection and production of known antibiotics and antimicrobial volatile compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for detection and
quantification of known antibiotics like ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, miconazole, ketokonazole and fluconazole from a single strain of endophytic fungi. We
reported significantly high amount of miconazole in the crude ethyl acetate extract which
again supports its ability to synthesize antimicrobial bioactive compounds. Moreover, detection of betaketosynthase (KS) domain in PKS gene cluster and adenylation domain (A) in
NRPS gene clusters suggests that this strain can serve as a resource for bioactive natural products. We conclude that, the endophytic fungus A. clavatonanicus strain MJ31 associated with
root tissues of M. jalapa showed the ability to resist fungal pathogens which can be exploited
not only in developing biocontrol agents in crop disease management, but also as sustainable
and alternative resource for the discovery of potent antimicrobial metabolites.",0
"and optimization of the emergency logistics network is constructed. In each decision-making cycle, there are four decisionmaking steps which are cyclical and progressive. The four steps include the analysis of public health emergency transmission, design of emergency logistics network, data collection and processing, and the adjustment and update of parameter. In
this decision-making framework, the entire emergency response process of public health emergencies is transformed into
a collaborative decision-making process of data learning and the optimization of resource allocation. The main theoretical
contributions of this paper include the following four aspects: (1) From the perspective of data-driven, we built a real-time

The problem of capacity combination optimization is embedded in the proposed network model of emergency location, so it
is much difficult to solve the general coverage problem within the sets, which has great practical significance; (4) Taking into
account the characteristics of the linear equation system and the principle of trend prediction, the relevant parameters of
health events are dynamically adjusted and updated.
In this paper, we assumed that the population of the infected area remained generally balanced during the transmission of public health emergencies, regardless of population movements in the inflected area. For the study of the
transmission of public health emergencies in the future, we will further consider the impact of the characteristics of
population mobility as well as various government control measures on the transmission dynamics of public health
emergencies. As for the design of emergency logistics networks, we will further consider the impact brought by
emergency budget restrictions, emergency service as well as other factors in the future. The emergency logistics network
model under various scenarios will be compared with the existing emergency modeling methods.",0
"Here we presented an integrative study where comparative analysis and computational prediction have been applied to assess the cross-species transportation of miRNAs, particularly focusing on inferring the likelihood of exogenous miRNA in human circulation. Given the limited
understanding about miRNA circulation, this study will contribute substantially in overcoming
the aforementioned scientific limitations and dramatically reducing the extensive lab-load in
miRNA biology research by using a revolutionary systems-driven strategy to study this complex problem. Specifically, this bioinformatics-driven study enables bypass the following key
issues: (1) Lack of supporting information to discern between endogenous miRNA synthesis or
dietary miRNA absorption in the miRNA expression change in human blood test subjects; (2)
Inference from endogenous miRNA synthesis [67] that might compensate for dietary miRNA
deficiency; (3) potential distinct metabolism of dietary miRNAs in the intestinal mucosa. Substantial follow-up studies will be conducted to extend the analysis and clarify in greater detail

tools developed for characterizing miRNA circulation and targeting will be useful for other

Hence, adjunctive Pulse D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19.",0
"To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine a comprehensive theoretical model of weight bias in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms in bariatric surgery candidates. Our study advances
the understanding of the risk and protective mechanisms associated with

role for weight bias and shame in psychological health among people
with obesity seeking bariatric surgery and implicate self-compassion,
a trainable affect-regulation strategy, as an important protective factor
that may confer some resiliency against EWB-related risk of depression
or anxiety. Continued investigation of the contributions of weight bias,
shame, and self-compassion to psychiatric health in bariatric surgery
patients may contribute to improved screening, detection, and treatment
of those vulnerable to adverse postoperative psychiatric sequelae. Such
efforts will be complemented by ongoing efforts to reduce social stigma

"The present study performed on nearly three hundred university students showed that CMV infection is associated with seemingly increased intelligence measured with The Intelligence Structure Test I-S-T 2000 R. The negative correlation between intelligence and duration of the infection estimated on the basis of concentration of anti-CMV antibodies and the results of the permutation test suggests that the seemingly increased intelligence of CMV-infected subjects is a result of presence of the subpopulation of subjects with very old infection and therefore also the most decreased intelligence in the subpopulation of seronegative subjects. In accordance with the Bradford-Hill 5th criterion of causality, this negative correlation between intelligence and concentration of anti-CMV antibodies also suggests, but, of course, not definitively proves, that the CMV-intelligence association is rather the effect than the cause of the CMV infection. CMV infection in both developing and developed countries is very high; most of the world population is probably infected with this herpetic virus. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human intelligence, and secondarily on all the other aspects of human life, including quality of life and economy, may be extremely high.

"Reference absorbed dose rate measurements of a prototype 106Ru/106Rh eye plaque developed indigenously were carried out using
an extrapolation chamber. Both planar and curved eye plaque were used
for the study to investigate the effect of air gap and positioning un

measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved
106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28
mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate
of curved eye plaque is about ~ 5% as compared to planar eye plaque
which is attributed to differences in the source configuration. The
FLUKA-based dose rates per μCi of 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08
mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06 mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye
plaques which match well with the measurements. It is demonstrated
that an estimate of activity can be derived by comparing the Monte

one has to know the exact geometry of the curved eye plaque and
extrapolation chamber for reliable simulation results and hence the

"RPMD with non-equilibrium initial conditions in combination with
FSSH. RPSH performs well for all one-dimensional scenarios discussed. For cases where the crossing point is below the initial excitation, RPSH performs as well as FSSH, which can capture most of
the exact quantum dynamics. For dynamics involving an energetically higher-lying crossing point, RPSH clearly outperforms standard FSSH with and without Wigner sampling. RPSH can reproduce the time-dependent dissociation probability well and also gives
reasonable adiabatic and diabatic populations. Although only onedimensional scenarios are discussed in this work, the generalization of the approach to any number of degrees of freedom is
straightforward. Both RPMD and FSSH have been employed to treat
high-dimensional systems efficiently, and any equations presented

In order to study the thermoresponsive microspheres-assisted

dilution method, especially around LCST of P(NIPAM-coBMA) brushes. The optimal structural features of PSP(NIPAM-co-BMA) microspheres are medium particle sizes,
large pore sizes, and high brush grafting amounts. Another
important advantage of the particles is the self-precipitation
ability after refolding, which can promote the recovery of the
microspheres through facile filtration",0

"To our knowledge, the present experiments are the first to demonstrate a

task. We replicated Walker and Hulme’s (1999, see also Tse & Altarriba, 2005) item
concreteness effect and further specified that this effect occurred for positive words
but not for negative words. These results indicate that word valence can modulate
immediate serial recall performance above and beyond the influence of word
concreteness. Hulme et al.’s (1997) item redintegration account might explain the
current findings by assuming that an attentional avoidance mechanism is in operation
when participants try to retrieve negative words. Whether the interactive effect
between word valence and word concreteness could also occur in other memory
paradigms, such as working memory tasks and sequential learning paradigms, such as
serial reaction time tasks, should be further investigated in future studies. Future

"In conclusion, a total of 62 volatile compounds (table 1) were identified in all the six flavoured tobacco IQOS HeatSticks, complementing the offline studies submitted by PMI and others. The difference in the identified species arises from the contrasting analytical methodologies, with ours being designed to target volatiles in real time. However, the GC-MS set-up displayed low sensitivities to some compounds and was not able to resolve all isomers. Moreover, compounds beyond a mass of 350 Da could not be analysed due to the imposed limit. Future real-time studies will employ highly sensitive instruments like Orbitrap MS and expand the mass scan range. With this approach, we expect to identify more compounds that may exhibit high toxicity for human health and thereby help improve the tobacco regulatory system. Future work will also focus on quantitative studies on nicotine, humectants (glycerol and propylene glycol) and potential carcinogenic species (carbonyls, furans and phthalates) identified in the GC-MS chromatogram. Quantitative measurements of these studies are relevant for determining the toxicity of the IQOS tobacco sticks.

"We could detect no widespread negative health effects in the unvaccinated other than the rare but
significant vaccine-targeted diagnosis. We can conclude that the unvaccinated children in this practice
are not, overall, less healthy than the vaccinated and that indeed the vaccinated children appear to be
significantly less healthy than the unvaccinated.
We concur with Mawson et al., 2017 [9], who reported: “Further research involving larger,
independent samples is needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in order to
optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health.”
We also concur with Hooker and Miller 2020 [14], who wrote: “Further study is necessary to
understand the full spectrum of health effects associated with childhood vaccination”.
Other pediatric practices with variably vaccinating populations should be studied using a
methodology similar to ours to attempt to refute or validate our findings and those of Mawson et al.,
2017 [9], Hooker and Miller 2020 [14], and the numerous studies that have reported adverse health
following vaccination. We are particularly interested in further study of the relationship between specific
vaccines and combination of vaccines on specific outcomes as well as the relationship between the
uptake of specific types of vaccines—inactivated, live virus, and aluminum-adjuvanted—with specific
outcomes. Larger studies using electronic medical records from major medical institutions should be
undertaken by research teams with no financial interest in the outcome of the studies (e.g., revenue from
vaccination and from treatment of vaccine-related adverse outcomes).
Unintended and nonspecific consequences of vaccination, such as increased risk of chronic health
conditions from vaccine exposures, must also be examined to determine if for any vaccine-targeted
infection alternative methods of infection-avoidance or effective treatments that reduce disease sequela
are available and preferable to vaccination in various circumstances, as has been reported by Cowling

vaccination may increase respiratory virus infection risk, clearly a grave concern in the age of COVID-19.
Our finding of a robust signal of anemia deserves follow up: aluminum is known to bind
to transferrin [26] and, in so doing, may interfere with the proper deposition of iron in the bones
of children. Iron deficiency can also contribute to febrile seizures, a known side effect of some
vaccines. Our society should work to identify safer vaccine schedules and safer adjuvants [27–35] and
to reduce autoimmunity risk by removing unsafe epitopes—peptide sequences from pathogens or
human cell line remnants in vaccines that match human proteins in sequence or structure from any
tissue [36]—would seem expeditious, kind, and wise.

"""Conclusions
        The immunization strategy discussed in this paper is not the only option for outbreak control agencies. In fact, there are three possible general courses of action with regard to ORI. The outbreak can run its course, maximizing the number of infections at the lowest cost. Or, the outbreak control agency can immunize as many persons as possible, thus minimizing the number of infections and maximizing cost. However, there is middle road, the one facilitated by the RPORITA developed in this research: the outbreak control agency can immunize the minimum number of persons required to achieve the ORIT at that point in the outbreak. This approach strikes a balance between these inversely related objectives by limiting both infections and cost, resulting in an optimal strategy for impoverished nations seeking to preserve limited funds.
        It is duly noted that higher vaccination coverage will reduce the number of infections caused by the outbreak, as it would further reduce the individual reproduction number. However, once the individual reproduction number has become less than unity, the outbreak will eventually cease regardless of its exact value within the range from 0 to 1. The specific individual reproduction number determines the number of infections.
        The model for the individual reproduction number in equation (19) can be applied to outbreak control strategy to determine the effects of vaccination on the ability of the VPD to spread through the population at different points in an outbreak. This equation incorporates three critical factors affecting the ability of vaccination to reduce the individual reproduction number: the point in the outbreak at which these vaccinations would occur (involves variables c, S, and I), the vaccination coverage before the new vaccinations (which determines V), and the number of additional vaccinations (). With this tool the time at which vaccination has the optimum impact on the individual reproduction number may be determined. Also, equation (19) may help answer the question: are these vaccinations worth their financial cost at this point in the outbreak?
        Overall, the primary purpose of the RPORITA is to predict, several days in advance, the minimum number of vaccines required to achieve ORIT and thereby gradually stop an outbreak. This prediction capability would allow poorer nations to plan and coordinate an immunization drive that implements the minimum amount of resources needed to guarantee the end to a VPD outbreak at that point. Despite the moderate prediction error, considering the multitude of variables and factors that affect the ORIT during an outbreak, the RPORITA proves to be accurate in its prediction of the ORIT. Overall, the RPORITA strikes a delicate balance between real-time applicability (through simplicity) and accuracy, thus achieving the overall goal of this research.""",0

"Conclusions
      The present study suggested that long-period exposure to TiO2 NPs resulted in severe kidney pathological changes and apoptosis, coupled with unbalance of mineral elements and severe oxidative stress. Furthermore, the nephrotoxicity following exposure to TiO2 NPs may be closely related to significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in immune/inflammatory responses, apoptosis, biological processes, oxidative stress, metabolic processes, the cell cycle, ion transport, signal transduction, cell component, transcription, translation, and cell differentiation. Axud1, Bcl6, Cf1, Cfd, Cyp4a12a, Cyp4a12b, Cyp2d9, Birc5, Crap2, and Tfrc genes may be potential biomarkers of kidney toxicity caused by TiO2 NPs exposure. Therefore, the application of TiO2 NPs in food, toothpastes, cosmetics and medicine should be carried out cautiously.",0
"Conclusions
      This study showed that brain activation decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning, when a patient with schizophrenia was changed from FGA to a SGA medication. Total motor activity, however, was not altered during this change in medication, although our findings interestingly indicate that a change to SGA alters variability measures towards what was seen in a healthy control group shown in one of our prior studies
[11].
      We do not have test-retest data for fMRI from this particular study. This may represent a limitation of the study, since intra- and inter-individual variability generally is a problem in fMRI studies. However we do not think that our findings are caused by such confounding effects, since other studies, using variants of the same paradigm have shown similar patterns as found after medication in the present study
[9,12]. An additional limitation of the fMRI data is the possibility that some of the changes from the first to the second session could be driven by learning effects and by the instruction to press the response button on target trials, which could lead to reduced activation due to facilitation. This is however not likely to explain all the findings that also were outside of areas to be affected. Another limitation is the rather weak statistical effects, not surviving standard correction procedures for multiple significance tests. Such procedures are typically applied to group average data, and may have reduced applicability for a single case study.
      A case study like the current study has its obvious limitations when it comes to generalizations to the population of schizophrenia patients. However, group averages based on large samples could equally be criticised for lacking in representativeness for a single patient, which is what the clinician is facing. Group averages are by definition not fully representative for any individual subject in the group, both because of the effect of statistical averaging and from the perspective of individual variation in response to antipsychotic medication (which is substantial in schizophrenia). Thus, reporting data for a single patient, measured longitudinally, being his own control, may yield clinically relevant data.
      The patterns of variability in the motor activity after switching antipsychotics from a FGA to a SGA are not easy to interpret. While the mean motor activity level and sample entropy were unchanged, risperidone reduced variability, particularly the variability from minute to minute, reflected in the RMSSD and also the RMSSD/SD ratio, towards what has been reported in healthy controls
[11]. Nonlinear methods have addressed the severe disturbances in neurocognitive dysfunctioning as one of the core features of schizophrenia
[13,14]. Wrist worn actigraphy for motor registration and magnetic resonance imaging for brain activation have shown correlations between motor activity and changes in brain structure
[15]. Our findings comparing a patient switching from a first to a second generation antipsychotic supports these findings.
      The high perphenazine level observed in our patient could be explained by the low CYP2D6 metabolic capacity
[16].
      The decreased activation in the right inferior frontal and insula region is somewhat of a puzzle since one would have expected increased activation. It has been suggested that the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula areas are involved in complex attentional and working memory processing. Possibly, these brain areas are involved in cognitive control related to attentional focus on stimuli that are urgent or close in time and space
[17], and it is unclear how such functions relate to reduced activation. Moreover, the right fronto-insular cortex has been implicated in a wide range of cognitive control mechanisms involved in a variety of cognitive control processes, including conflict and error monitoring, interference resolution, and response selection
[18]. The inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula has also been associated with psychosis. Insular dysfunction may be important for the development of psychosis due to its influence on the salience network
[19]. Furthermore, the right inferior frontal area and posterior insula has been indicated in auditory hallucinations
[20].
      We conclude that changes in neuronal brain activation decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning when a patient with schizophrenia was changed from a FGA to a SGA. At the same time although the total motor activity was not altered, variability measures changed towards values seen in healthy controls. Our study underscores the value of casuistic reports of schizophrenic patients examined during different conditions using objective recording methods in pharmacological treatment studies. Although the actigraph data were partly in accordance with the hypothesis, the brain activation results were unexpected, and not hypothesized and would need careful replication in a group study with proper statistical power, before any firm conclusions can be reached.",0

"A facile design of an ultra-thin broadband MA for C-band applications is proposed using a numerical method. The proposed MA is composed of a single layer metal-dielectric-metal structure based on FR-4 substrate. The broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with the absorption efficiency greater than 90% and RAB of 66.67% at normal incidence is achieved. The high absorptivity of proposed MA is also retained over 80% for the large incident angle up to 40° under both TE and TM polarizations. The absorption mechanism of broadband metamaterial absorber is investigated by using electric and surface current distributions, which is also confirmed via the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for the C-band applications such as radar cross section and EM interference reduction.",0

      In summary, PPI was observed for the first time on nano oxide electronic transistors. Representative artificial synaptic behaviors, such as synaptic transmission, PPF and PPI were processed and mimicked here.

When an electrical stimulus was applied, the artificial bio synapse had a temporary increase and then spontaneous decay of conductance along time. The increase in conductance could be amplified or reduced by applying successive stimuli at short intervals. Repeated stimuli made the transition have a residual current for the next round of CC, or could have electrons injected to decrease the next round of CC due to the large amplitude and Vo impact on the device insulator. This research could, thus, help improve neuromorphic electronics for neurocomputing based on biocompatible artificial synapses as well as the development of medical research.",0

"4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported a facile synthesis of nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx via
6 h, 12 h and 20 h hydrothermal treatments of C6H12N4 solution. TiO2/TiN nanoparticles inserted
between the Ti3C2Tx layers, which effectively prevent the self-restacking of Ti3C2Tx during fabrication
and enable more pesudocapacitances. Moreover, benefiting from the introduction of nitrogen and
the NH4
+ intercalation, the accessibility of the Ti3C2Tx layers to electrolyte ions is also enhanced.
When employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the 20 h N-TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx electrode
exhibited high performances with a specific capacitance of 361 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a capacitance
retention of 85.8% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles when used in a three-electrode configuration
in 1 M H2SO4. Besides, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivered an energy density of
4.42 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.14 kW kg−1
. Furthermore, the influence of ionic radius in
different electrolytes were studied by using H2SO4, Li2SO4, Na2SO4, LiOH and KOH electrolytes.
The H2SO4 electrolyte possessed excellent conductivity and empowered faster and easier surface redox
reactions, which brought about greater contributions to intercalation-pseudocapacitance. The excellent
electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique architecture with physical confinement
preventing the restacking of Ti3C2Tx, and the minimized pass path between electrolyte and electrodes.
This facile synthesis paves a new strategy to achieve promising pseudocapacitance MXene electrode
materials in practical applications",0

"5. Conclusion
We found that enemy-mediated conspecific distance- and density-dependence is more likely to happen at the seedling stage
than at the seed stage. There is strong evidence that fungal
pathogens are key drivers in causing conspecific distanceand density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, but
there have been too few studies so far to rule out a role for
specialist insects. Different sizes of mammals had opposite
effects on distance-dependent mortality at the seed stage;
small mammals could cause significant negative distancedependence, but large mammals may overwhelm this effect.
More manipulative experiments considering multiple natural
enemy types combined and separately should be conducted
in the future to reveal the mechanisms behind negative
conspecific density-dependence and make predictions for

"Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice.
Evidence for the benefits and harms of radioembolisation with or without sorafenib and compared with sorafenib alone in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is highly insufficient. We cannot determine if radioembolisation plus sorafenib compared with sorafenib alone affects all‐cause mortality or the occurrence of adverse events. Radioembolisation compared with sorafenib seemed to achieve equivalent survival and to cause fewer adverse effects, but our level of certainty was very low. Evidence for the benefits and harms of radioembolisation versus chemoembolisation in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is also highly insufficient. Radioembolisation did not seem to differ from chemoembolisation in terms of serious adverse events and health‐related quality of life, but the certainty of evidence was very low. Additional well‐performed and high‐quality placebo‐controlled randomised clinical trials are needed to assess patient‐centred outcomes.",0

"Conclusions
In this study, an injectable and thermosensitive hydrogel encapsulating Cu2MnS2 nanoparticles for photothermal therapy against cancer was reported. The Cu2MnS2 particles show nanoplate structure with a diameter of about 35 nm. The nanoplates evenly distributed in the hydrogel matrix and, maintained its particle size unchanged. The PTA loaded hydrogel shows excellent photo-heat conversion ability and outstanding repeated irradiation stability. The hydrogel not only exhibited thermo-responsive in situ gel-forming capacity at body temperature, but also reduced the chemical toxicity of the Cu2MnS2 by “prisoning” the nanoplates in the matrix. Moreover, the concentrated PTA in the hydrogel performed more promising therapeutic effects against cancer cells than the nanoplates solution. At last, the Cu2MnS2 nanoplates embedded hydrogel displayed pronouncing tumor curing effects after peritumoral administration due to the enhanced retention in vivo and elevated local temperature surrounding the tumor tissue upon the NIR exposure. Meantime, the preparation shows insignificant systemic toxicity.",0
"Conclusion
A facile design of an ultra-thin broadband MA for C-band applications is proposed using a numerical method. The proposed MA is composed of a single layer metal-dielectric-metal structure based on FR-4 substrate. The broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with the absorption efficiency greater than 90% and RAB of 66.67% at normal incidence is achieved. The high absorptivity of proposed MA is also retained over 80% for the large incident angle up to 40° under both TE and TM polarizations. The absorption mechanism of broadband metamaterial absorber is investigated by using electric and surface current distributions, which is also confirmed via the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for the C-band applications such as radar cross section and EM interference reduction.",0

of the fermented bases. However, it was shown that it was different in all three bases.
This reflects an important role of the base on the texture. Supplementation with LGG®

Abstract
The present investigation aimed to assess the impact of copper (Cu) stress on the physiological and proteomic behavior of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. E. camaldulensis is likely a potential phytoremediator in areas vulnerable to Cu contamination, such as the industrial areas of Riyadh. To realize this objective, young seedlings of E. camaldulensis were potted in an open area with soil comprised of clay and sand. Different doses of Cu (30, 50, and 100 µM) were applied to the plants as CuSO4·5H2O for 6 weeks. Plant growth was monitored during the Cu exposure period, and morphological and physiological indicators were measured once a week to determine the growth rates. A proteomics study was also conducted to find out the influence of Cu stress on proteins. Our results showed that growth was negatively affected by Cu treatment, particularly at the highest concentrations. Moreover, using a proteomic analysis showed 26 targets involved in protein expression. Elevated levels of Cu increased the expression of 11 proteins and decreased the expression of 15 proteins. Changes were detected in proteins involved in photosynthesis, translation, transcription, metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings provided insights into the molecular mechanisms related to Cu stress, in addition to its influence on the morphological and physiological attributes of E. camaldulensis seedlings. This investigation aimed to characterize the mechanism behind the impact of Cu stress on the plant.

1. Introduction
Today the globe is facing critical environmental crises, posing severe problems to humans and natural habitats [1]. Among such ecological complications is the stress in plants caused by water and soil contaminated with heavy metals, leading to stress in the overall food chain. Recently, a variety of factors have substantiated the pollution levels of air, water, and soil. Such factors include industrial activities, abandonment, sewage discarding practices, and the growth of cities, all posing toxic threats to living organisms [2,3]. Heavy metals are broadly recognized by their relatively high atomic masses (usually above 4 g/cm3), and are poisonous even at low concentrations [4,5]. For adequate plant development, some heavy metals are considered essential nutrients that play significant roles in plant life. However, accumulation of such metals in the environment has increased dramatically, often higher than that necessary for the plant’s growth. Under these elevated levels, all heavy metals have increased toxic effects and can be regarded as ecological impurities [6].
Many reports indicate plants are equipped with specialized tolerance mechanisms that mitigate the adverse effects of heavy metal exposure, although significant damage in plants, such as suppression of photosynthesis, was also observed as a consequence of elevated heavy metal exposure [7,8]. However, Maisto et al. [9] reported contrasting observations related to photosynthesis in Quercus ilex L. leaves when studying metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as indicators of pollution.
The toxicity of heavy metals involves its binding to functional sites in biologically vital molecules (enzymes), disturbing cell integrity by changing proteins and nucleic acids, as well as disrupting other important metabolites in the cell [10]. Among the heavy metals, copper (Cu2+) is a toxic metal. In the current investigation we focus on Cu2+. Cu2+ is a redox-active transition ion and a necessary micro-element for plant development [11], however, it can be considered a toxic element when its concentrations in plant tissue exceeds that of the optimum requirement [12,13,14]. The positive influence of Cu on plant growth has long been observed, and has been well-recognized when fungicides containing Cu salts are used [15]. However, the common and continued use of fungicides in cultivated areas has led to a high accumulation of Cu, putting both the ecological value and the fertility of the soil at hazardous levels [16]. Plants exposed to heavy metals may also be subjected to a widespread range of physiological and biochemical alterations [17].
Auto-oxidation and the Fenton reaction usually lead to development of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the block of important biomolecules. Movement of metal ions from such biomolecules is the main mechanism of heavy metal accumulation in plant tissues [2]. Furthermore, in our post-genomic era, proteomics is a well-known technique to study protein expression in an organism through its genome [18,19]. Moreover, plant stress responses, and adaptation to the stress caused by heavy metals, are frequently associated with alterations in the proteome [17]. Proteomics can be used as a powerful technique to uncover differences in cell, tissue, organ, and organelle protein levels, including the profiles under several heavy metal stress environments [20]. The literature also mentions that proteomics help in detecting the target proteins involved in heavy metal detoxification. Recent studies confirmed the increments of defense protein involved in ROS scavenging and in maintaining redox homeostasis in heavy metal stressed plants [21,22]. In an early study by Bona et al. [23], the response of Cannabis sativa roots to Cu stress was reported. Their findings revealed variations in the protein expression pattern for reinstating cellular homeostasis, where two proteins were suppressed, seven proteins were down regulated, and five proteins were up regulated. Some proteomic studies were focused on Cu stress in Arabidopsis thaliana [24], Cannabis sativa roots L. [23], Oryza sativa [25], and Agrostis capillaris [26].
Plants react differentially to heavy metal stresses according to their species, the metal type, and metal concentration [27]. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of plant responses are needed using proteomic studies under Cu stress. In the current study we have tried to uncover the relationship between Cu stress and the molecular response in E. camaldulensis seedlings. E. camaldulensis has been used in the current study because it is abundant in Riyadh industrial areas. These industries might be the main reason for environmental contamination, especially in industries where production of fertilizer involves Cu and leads to its bioavailability and abundance in the environment. Furthermore, E. camaldulensis is characterized by its fast growth rate, relatively large biomass, extensive root system, and its tolerance to a wide spectrum of soil conditions [28]. Therefore, the present investigation was based on the assumption that E. camaldulensis would fit as a good candidate plant species for environmental clean-up in sites contaminated with heavy metals. This hypothesis might be well supported by Assareh et al. [29]. Nevertheless, its molecular response to Cu stress is still vague. Proteomics results and physiological responses from the current study might improve our understanding of E. camaldulensis and its response to Cu stress. A thorough understanding of the plant’s stress response to heavy metals could support the identification of tolerance proteins or genes, and the development of a detoxification tool [30].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethics Statement
Determination of the target species chosen for this study was performed by collecting materials of several plant species from three different locations (Riyadh industrial area, landfill near Nazeem, and Thumamah) in Riyadh (N 38.24°, E 43.46°), Saudi Arabia. No collection specifications were obligatory for these locations. Plants used in the current study are public and non-protected types. The candidate plant species chosen for the current investigation is E. Camaldulensis due to its availability in the three different locations.
2.2. Material Collection and Treatment
E. camaldulensis seedlings (three months old) were provided from a commercial nursery in Riyadh, May 2017. Similar genetic backgrounds were expected since plants were collected from the same source. The seedlings were acclimated to a greenhouse (temperature 28–35 °C, photoperiod 12 hours per day). E. camaldulensis seedlings were placed into pots (16 cm diameter) containing a soil mixture of clay:sand in a 1:2 ratio. The experimental plants were exposed to a wide range of Cu concentrations (100, 50, and 30 µM of Cu, applied as CuSO4·5H2O for a period of six weeks). Each Cu treatment was comprised of four replicates. Shoots and roots per plant were cut, washed in deionized water, placed in airtight plastic bags, and then kept at −80 °C for additional study.
2.3. Growth and Physiological Performance
During the experimental period, growth indicators were monitored weekly (height, stem collar width, and leaf formation), and the relative growth rates were calculated. The relative water content of the leaves, and fresh weights of both shoot and root were determined gravimetrically following termination of the experiment. Plant samples were oven-dried for one week at 60 °C to achieve a constant weight for determining shoot and root dry mass.
2.4. Determination of Relative Water Content
For determination of relative water content in the plant under Cu stress, leaf tissues were taken to determine the relative water content, according to Morgan [31], with the aid of the following equation:
RWC(%)=(fresh weight − dry weight)(sturated weight − dry weight)×100
2.5. Determination of Chlorophyll Content
Leaf samples were collected and frozen immediately. Chlorophyll content was determined when 5 mL of 80% acetone was added to a 0.5 g leaf sample and measured using spectrophotometer. Resulting data were calculated as mg/g Fresh weight [32]. Chlorophyll content data was presented as mean ± SD for three replicates.
2.6. Determination of Copper (Cu) Concentration
Cu concentrations in leaves and root tissues were determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (NOVA 300, Analytik, Jena, Germany) according to Fu et al. [33]. Dry plant samples were milled to a fine powder, then digested using perchloric acid and nitric acid in a ratio of 13:87 by volume. Thereafter, 5% of HNO3 was used to dissolve the digest for Cu quantification.
2.7. Protein Extraction from Plant Leaves
For the determination of protein, liquid nitrogen was used for milling the frozen leaves using a mortar and pestle. The protein extraction procedure was done according to Roy et al. [34]. To perform two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), a trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone protocol was used. Two technical replicates per sample were prepared.
2.8. Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA)/Acetone Protocol
Leaf powders from the control plants (3 g) and the Cu-treated plants (100 µM) were placed in 10 mL of ice-cold 10% TCA in 0.07% (v/v) acetone and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The homogenate was sonicated for 10 min and incubated for 1 h at −20 °C. The pellet was separated after centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min, washed with ice-cold acetone (0.07% (v/v) 2-ME) twice, and then centrifuged at 4 °C and dehydrated. Thereafter, dried samples were lysed using buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 5% CHAPS, and 2 mM tributylphosphine), incubated for 60 min at 25 °C, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min. Thereafter, protein concentration was determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) method [35].
2.9. Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2-DE) Protein Gel Electrophoresis
A gel electrophoresis technique (two-dimensional isoelectric focusing) was performed utilizing a Bio-Rad PROTEAN IEF (isoelectric focusing) cell on an IPG strip with a length of 24 cm and pH 5–8 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). For protein dilution, 300 lg total protein was diluted with a rehydration solution (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 1% DTT, 0.2% IPG buffer (pH 5–8), and 0.001% bromophenol blue) to 420 ll. Active rehydration was done by loading the samples into the IEF tray at 20 °C for 13 h, followed by 250 V for 60 min. Subsequently, a linear increase of voltage was applied to 10,000 V for a period of four hours, with isoelectric focusing operated at 20 °C for 90,000 VH. Following IEF separation, strips were equilibrated for 15 min in an equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 0.375 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 2% DTT), then re-equilibrated for 15 min using the same buffer, except that DTT was replaced by 2.5% iodoacetamide. The 2-D SDS electrophoresis was done on 12.5% (w/v) horizontal slab gels using a Bio-Rad PROTEAN PLUS horizontal Dodeca cell at a temperature of 18 °C. For application of SDS–PAGE, voltage was fixed at 100 V for 60 min, then increased to 200 V until the bromophenol blue frontier was detected at the gel bottom.
2.10. Protein Imaging
For the purpose of staining protein spots, an image scanner (HP Scanjet G 4010) was used and the analysis was performed using the Progenesis Same Spot software version 3.0 (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd.). Two replicates from both control and Cu-treated gels were used to carry out the match set with the selected master gels. Student’s t-test (p ≤ 0.05) was used to find out differences in the abundance between spots. For MS (mass spectrometry) identification, protein spots with > 2-fold changes were used.
2.11. Bioinformatics Analysis of the Identified Proteins
Proteins identified in the current investigation were clustered according to Colak et al. [36] using DAVID gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis bioinformatics tools. Fold changes of identified proteins at Cu treatment (100 µM) compared to control are presented.
2.12. Statistical Analysis
The current data was statistically processed using JMP statistical program (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Trials were set using four plants per Cu treatment. A one-way ANOVA was used, and means were separated by a Tukey-test at p ≤ 0.05 significance, which is denoted by dissimilar letters. Figures were prepared using Origin software.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Changes in Plant Morphology
With progressive increases of Cu treatment, leaf chlorosis was noticeable after five weeks from the commencement of Cu treatment in the E. camaldulensis seedlings. The degree of chlorosis was more intense in plants that received 100 µM compared to those treated with low Cu concentrations (30 and 50 µM). In addition, the leaves on the plant that received the highest Cu dose started to droop and saw increasing discoloration. Early studies indicated that phytotoxicity induced by excessive Cu uptake may lead to plant growth suppression, membrane lipid peroxidation, leaf chlorosis, and necrosis [24,37]. Some of these results and observations are in agreement with our current findings.
3.2. Influence of Cu on Plant Growth
Exposure of E. camaldulensis to Cu caused no effect on shoot height both at 30 and 50 µM concentrations; however, seedlings that received the highest dose (100 µM) exhibited significant reductions in their shoot height growth rates compared to untreated controls (Figure 1a). A similar response pattern was also observed in both stem diameter (Figure 1b) and leaf formation (Figure 1c). Furthermore, data showed higher Cu concentrations in roots relative to that in the shoots (Figure 1d).

Figure 1. Effects of Cu stress on (A) shoot height, (B) stem diameter, (C) leaf formation, and (D) Cu concentration in the leaves and roots of E. camaldulensis seedlings. Different letters indicate significant differences at p < 0.05. Each experiment was performed in four replicates.
The observed reduction in plant growth might be attributed to the inhibitory impact of the metal on the metabolic processes responsible for growth and development, which is in agreement with many other previous studies [9,14,38]. Furthermore, quantitative analysis showed that relative water content, chlorophyll content, shoot and root fresh weight, and shoot and root dry weight of seedlings treated with the highest dose (100 µM) were significantly reduced by 33.3%, 54.8%, 36.5%, 42.5%, 40.7%, and 33.3% respectively, relative to those of the control (Table 1). On the other hand, similar trends in observations and reductions were noticed for shoot and root fresh weight and shoot and root dry weight for O. glazioviana in response to Cu stress [27]. The perturbation in the biomass production in both shoot and root might be linked to the effect of Cu on cell division, which retarded normal cell growth and development [39]. The diminishing effect of Cu on chlorophyll content and remarkable reduction in relative leaf water content might be a consequence of Cu stress, as reported in other studies [40,41,42]. Mostofa et al. [41] stated that Cu stress induced a reduction in rice seedling growth, which might be due to the disruptive interference Cu has in protein and plant metabolism. Addition of Cu to E. camaldulensis seedlings was found to increase the Cu level in the plant tissues, with the root retaining more Cu relative to the shoot (Figure 1d), which indicates that roots are the main site for the accumulation of Cu. This observation conformed with several former reports in rice and beans [41,43].
Table 1. Effect of copper (Cu) stress on growth characteristics of E. camaldulensis. Statistically significant differences are indicated with stars: (*) p < 0.05 or (**) p < 0.01. Data are given as means ± standard deviation (SD).

Different studies have indicated that Cu is a detrimental metal that interferes with a plant’s morphological, physiological, and proteomic characteristics because Cu is highly toxic to the plant [44,45,46]. Fold changes in protein and protein expression in relation to Cu stress are introduced in Table 2. Twenty six (26) proteins were identified under Cu stress from the leaves of E. camaldulensis—11 saw increased protein expression and 15 saw decreased protein expression.

The 26 differentially expressed proteins were identified and the UniProt database was used. Figure 2 illustrates the protein gel images, and Figure 3 shows the abundance patterns of different separated proteins. Figure 4 shows the functional classes of the identified proteins with respect to their biological functions (Figure 4a,b) and cellular constituents (Figure 4c).

3.4. Changes in Proteomic Profile
The current investigation was designed to explore the possible mechanisms for the alterations seen in the plant protein when affected by Cu. The leaf proteome was tested using 2D-GE. Soluble proteins were determined from leaf tissues of both the treated and control plants. The experiment was replicated twice and identified 200 protein spots. Image analyses quantified 26 proteins expressing greater than a 1.5-fold increase in concentration. Out of the 26 differentially expressed proteins, 11 proteins increased expression, whereas the remaining 15 proteins assumed a decrease in the treated sample relative to controls. Figure 3 represents the separated proteins as a comparison between control and treated plants.
The separated proteins for the plants pre-treated with Cu were categorized in different groups according to molecular functions, including metabolic processes (45.8%), photosynthesis (16.7%), anti-oxidant enzymes (8.3%), transcription and translation processes (25%), and other unknown functions (15.5%). Cu stress may affect protein metabolism, which leads to a reduction in the protein concentration [47]. Different biological functions for such separated proteins might point to the complex plant processes observed under Cu stress conditions.
3.4.1. Photosynthetic Proteins
It is well known that photosynthesis is the most important biological process in plants, and this process is extremely sensitive to various stress conditions. A high accumulation of heavy metals inhibits the plant’s growth and development, in addition to its effect on the photosynthetic products [39]. Previous investigations have shown that elevated levels of Cu stress adversely influence the physiological and biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, metabolism of nitrogen, and element uptake in plants [13,48]. In the current study, several photosynthesis-related proteins were significantly reduced in Cu-stressed plants, such as rubisco (large and small sub-units). Photosynthesis-related proteins were also decreased by Cd stress in Brassica juncea [49,50], and had a damaging effect on vital activities, including photosynthesis, in Zea mays [51]. However, a recent investigation provided sufficient evidence, where photosynthetic responses to Cd and Pb stress in cardoon plant varieties were studied, to indicate that the effect of heavy metals on plants is species-specific [52].
Our findings also revealed that photosystem II was down-regulated. Similar response patterns have also been reported for other metals, such as Cd stress in sorghum [34]. The light-dependent photosynthesis reaction cytochrome b6 was negatively impacted by Cu stress. Similar observations were also noted by Hego et al. [26] when they studied the leaves of Cu-sensitive and Cu-tolerant Agrostis cappilaris. Alterations in photosynthetic electron transport chain components in response to stress may occur in the proteins involved cytochrome b6f [53]. Therefore, light-dependent (cytochrome b) and independent (rubisco) photosynthetic reactions were decreased, or negatively affected, by excess Cu in the leaves of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. This indicates damage in the photosynthesis mechanism since rubisco is the key enzyme responsible for CO2 assimilation during the dark reaction phase.
3.4.2. Antioxidant Enzymes and Related Proteins
Plant exposure to Cu may generate ROS, leading to oxidative stress and cell mortality [54]. Plants may develop defense mechanisms to mitigate and alleviate such effects, and prevent cell oxidation [55]. These mechanisms might be associated with enzymatic compounds, such as peroxidases and superoxide dismutase, that play an important ROS scavenging role. Some studies have shown that metal stress (such as Cd) may impair the antioxidant system in plants; therefore, ROS will be induced and will directly react with cellular components and organelles [56]. The anticipated accumulation of ROS during Cu stress may lead to the generation of high levels of antioxidant enzymes. Our study revealed that enzymes related to peroxidase detoxification were down regulated, however the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase showed increased accumulation during Cu treatment. A comparable pattern for SOD activity was also noted by Li et al. [46] when they studied Eichhornia crassipes and Pistatia stratiotes under Cd stress. Peroxidase down-regulation, observed for the Cu-stressed plants in the current study, might lead to speculation that the peroxidase was consumed during the defense process. Although, in a recent study [27], peroxidase accumulation in the roots of Oenthera glazioviana under Cu stress was shown.
In conclusion, alteration in the expression of ROS detoxification-related enzymes was apparent in the current study for peroxidase and Cu/Zn-SOD, highlighting the functions they display in cell protection.
3.4.3. Glycolysis and Carbohydrate Metabolism Related Proteins
The current investigation identified six proteins: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, Sucrose synthase, Phosphoribulokinase, Starch synthase_ chloroplastic/amyloplastic, and Phospholipase D. Glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GADPH) dehydrogenase is the major redox controller in metabolic process [57]. In energy metabolism the CA cycle is a key pathway for ATP synthesis, and responds to stressed environments through respiratory oxidation [58]. The current findings showed up-regulation of GADPH in plants exposed to Cu, as it could be involved in the response to biotic stress in the plant by glycolysis [59]. Similar increments of GADPH in A. thaliana under Cd stress was observed [60]. On the other hand, reduction of GADPH was reported when barley and rice were subjected to stress conditions with salt [61], and Poplar root when treated with Cd [62]. Furthermore, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, a catalyst involved in splitting fructose-1-6-bisphosphate into D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [63], is involved in glycolysis in the cytoplasm and in the Calvin cycle. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase decreased in the current study in response to Cu stress, as well as in Ectocarpus siliculosus isolated from Cu-contaminated soil [64]. Down-regulation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in the current study was supported by Kamal et al., [65] when he studied salt stress in wheat. The significance of MDH in Brachypodium seedling roots was reported as an adaptation response to a biotic stress by Chen et al. [66]. The down-regulation of MDH was observed during the first 3 days, but at 4 days it responded to Cd and osmotic stresses. Malte dehydrogenase may enhance a plant’s resistance to salt and Al stress since it increases the malic acid levels [67].
3.4.4. Energy and Carbohydrate Metabolism Proteins
The beta subunit of ATP synthase identified in the current investigation was down-regulated. It is an integrated protein associated with ATP hydrolysis and proton movement, providing electrochemical compounds [68]. Therefore, an increased production of ATP in response to Cu stress was expected. In a recent work, stimulation of ATPases in Agrostis capillaris leaves under Cu stress was noted [26], whereas other studies using tomato and wheat plants showed that ATPases were reduced in response to salt stress [69].
3.4.5. Proteins Involved in Transcription and Translation
Suppression of proteins and enzyme inactivation induced by heavy metal stress may affect cellular homeostasis [50]. Damaging effects on many cellular processes might be a consequence of the limitations in different gene regulators due to heavy metal stress [70]. In the present investigation, translational proteins such as 30S ribosomal S14, 30S ribosomal S15, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were down-regulated in E. camaldulensis leaves under 100 µM Cu treatment; however, elongation factor Tu was up-regulated. The eIF5A protein is a eukaryotic protein that contains hypusine amino acid; it has an important role as the translation initiation factor in RNA metabolism [71], and translation elongation [72]. Increased expression of eIF5A in plants related to abiotic stress was noted [73]. Currently, down regulation of eIF5A was noted (Table 2). Results were in line with Chen et al. [45] when he studied the behavior of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar roots under Cu stress. The main subunit of ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts is 30S [74]. This protein is involved in the translation process. 30S ribosomal protein S14 and S15 in chloroplasts were down-regulated in the current study under 100 µM Cu treatment in E. camaldulensis leaves. The same observations were also detected for Poplar leaves under Cd stress [75]. Genes related to translation and transcription can be expressed and regulated when the plant is subjected to adverse environmental conditions, leading to adaptation [76]. In the higher plants, the translational elongation step is mainly regulated by elongation factors. Down-regulation of the putative elongation factor 2 in rice under Cu stress conditions was noted [45], however, the current study detected up-regulation of elongation factors for E. camaldulensis leaves under Cu stress. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are enzymes that amplify microRNAs in eukaryotes [77], and protect plants against pathogenic agents [78]. In the current study, down regulation of RdRp was observed. Heat stress showed a decrease in mutant rdr2 for the gene encoding RdRp2 and dcl3 in Arabidopsis [79].
4. Conclusions
As stated previously, accumulation of heavy metals in plants may lead to a variety of deleterious effects in growth and development via perturbations in metabolic network. Cu can be highly toxic to plants when taken in excessive amounts. Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to highlight the alterations in plant metabolism that take place in E. camaldulensis as it responds to Cu stress exposure. Several stress indicators, together with proteomic studies, were analyzed under Cu stress to diagnose the effects. The damaging effects of Cu on growth and biomass elements for the E. camaldulensis seedlings was apparent, with the response being most pronounced under the elevated Cu level of 100 µM. Proteomic analysis performed in this investigation identified 26 proteins related to various metabolic functions, and such proteins were expressed at different availability levels under Cu stress conditions. The majority of the characterized proteins were mainly stress proteins as well as metabolism and regulatory proteins. Results obtained from the proteomic analysis has provided significant clues on how E. camaldulensis responds to Cu stress to achieve homeostasis.
Our findings showed a significant influence of Cu on protein metabolism, as attested by the inhibition of protein function. Proteomic analysis revealed the presence of special stress-related proteins, which can be speculated to assist E. camaldulensis seedlings in handling exposure to Cu exposure. In the future, it would be beneficial to further investigate the long-term effects of Cu on E. camaldulensis. Results of long-term investigations would enhance our understanding of the responsiveness of E. camaldulensis under various Cu toxicity levels.",0

Based on 40 studies of ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes, this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed pooled ORs of 1.03–1.21 for LBW and 0.97–1.06 for PTB when mothers were exposed to CO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 throughout their pregnancy. These associations may be relatively stable, but could be affected by some important factors such as exposure period, study settings, and smoking factors, which decreased the heterogeneity to some extent, but remained mostly non-significant in this study. Therefore, sources of heterogeneity between studies need to be further explored in future meta-analyses.",0

"5. Conclusions
In the present paper, we have shown that the ambient-dose-rate reduction function obtained from the airborne monitoring data can be applied uniformly to all zones in Date City. Regardless of the magnitude of the ambient dose rate, the difference in decontamination method, or whether or not decontamination was carried out, the reduction function was the same throughout Date City. Based on these results, the lifetime additional doses can be realistically estimated from the measured individual doses, extrapolated by means of the ambient-dose-rate reduction function. For establishing this method, which combines the individual dose and the ambient dose, the existence of large-scale and long-term glass-badge data of Date City was essential. Although the proportionality coefficient c = 0.15 may not be universal, the authors believe that the present method will make it possible in the future to reliably estimate the lifetime doses of residents living in contaminated areas based on regular airborne monitoring surveys, supplemented by smaller-scale individual dose monitoring surveys for the purpose of determining the ambient-dose-to-individual-dose coefficient c.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis leads to the conclusion that VR is a useful tool to reduce P in children undergoing dental treatment. No significant effect was found for DA. Studies in adults are scarce. On the other hand, most of the studies chose to focus on immersion in the pediatric population, neglecting a series of aspects that should be considered, such as training programs, the different types of software and hardware of virtual reality devices, the temperament and patient personality, gender difference and more. Due to all this, the role of virtual reality in the control of anxiety and dental pain in children and adults should be considered as a topic for future research.",0
"Conclusions
Anhedonia in youth is associated with hypoconnectivity at rest and hypoactivation during reward anticipation. This suggests perturbed intrinsic arousal connectivity and diminished extrinsic reward-arousal activity in the reward-anticipation context. Detecting such anhedonia-specific alterations helps differentiate the pathophysiological underpinnings of anhedonia from other phenotypes.",0
"Conclusion
The ability to rapidly adjust to novel information about a talker is perhaps not surprising a—statistical account in which listeners weighted all tokens from a talker equally would generate the prediction that it would be extremely difficult to adapt to the speech of very well-known talkers if a new perturbation or disruption was introduced. It would mean, for instance, that listeners who had only seen Meryl Streep playing American roles would struggle when confronted with her Polish-accented English in “Sophie’s Choice”, or that one might fail to understand the distorted speech of one’s parent after dental surgery. It is an empirical question whether this is the case for very familiar talkers. However, for the novel talkers in the current experiment, listeners appear to be maximally flexible to the most recent biasing information they are provided with, and do not create particularly rigid talker-specific beliefs.

The results of the current study urge a more detailed specification of memory in current models of distributional learning. Our findings particularly point to the flexibility that listeners show in accumulating phonetic information about a talker. Distributional accounts must allow (a) new evidence to have an outsize effect on learning, or (b) for local distributions to be formed on the basis of contextual information, for instance, allowing for the accumulation of information in units as long as the lexical decision block.",0

Topical application of 4% chlorhexidine on the umbilical cord of newborn infants born in lower income countries reduces neonatal mortality by 21% and omphalitis by 35%. Chlorhexidine use delays cord separation time by about 2.5 days in the hospital setting and 2 days in the community. The intervention is effective in both community-based as well as health facility settings for the prevention of omphalitis.

"Conclusions
Overall, obese patients had a higher incidence of TREM-1 over-expression and M1 macrophage proliferation. TREM-1 overexpression is associated with increased M1 macrophage markers and Th1 cytokines, and inversely related to M2 macrophage and Th2 cytokines. Our data also suggests that TREM-1 overexpression may predispose the pre-diabetics to obesity-induced IR via macrophage polarization. Thus, our study suggests that targeting TREM-1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in preventing the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance.",0
"5. Conclusions
The search for pro-survival factors is relevant for improving
stress resistance and preventing cell death of microbial cells under
industrial processes. Here, the Tps1 protein and its interplay with
apoptotic processes delineates novel targets for the selection and
engineering of more robust industrial strains. Conversely, Almeida
et al. (2008) reported the urgent need for a new generation of antifungal drugs that could enable the specific manipulation of yeast
cell death, without causing side effects on human cells. Despite
the high conservation of cell death processes between yeasts and
mammals, our finding that yeast apoptotic cell death was greatly
accelerated upon deletion of TPS1 could fulfil this need, since the
Tps1 protein is only presentin bacteria, fungi and plants, but absent
in mammals. Together with the key function of the Tps1 protein in
providing tolerance to hostile environments (Petitjean et al., 2015),
this architectural difference between apoptotic regulators of yeast
and mammalian cells appeared as a possible Achilles’ heel of yeast.
Beyond S. cerevisiae, the Tps1 protein could therefore represent
an appealing target for the selective destruction of closely related
pathogens (e.g. Candida albicans) and evolutionarily more distant
fungi (e.g. A. fumigatus).",0
"CONCLUSION
This paper presented novel perspectives for improving the understanding of connections between EMF exposure and IEQ in buildings. We proposed several strategies for mitigating electromagnetic emissions to improve building occupant health. A novel approach was developed based on a systematic method for exposure assessment of various building environments, including green buildings.

Emission intensity levels varied significantly based on locations and types of building spaces. Office building spaces exhibited relatively low electromagnetic emission intensity, and hospital building spaces exhibited relatively high power density values. The high electromagnetic emission intensities measured in surveyed green residential buildings highlight the importance of novel strategies for reducing radiation propagation. EMF intensity is greater at locations near radiation sources. Different types of building construction respond variably to EMF wave propagation. Certain materials, such as drywall, ceramic-faced lumber, tile-faced drywall, and plain or masonry-faced concrete, effectively shield EMF propagation, whereas glass and plain lumber have poor shielding effects. Drywall exhibited the best shielding effect among all compared building materials. Additionally, the magnitudes of the transmission coefficients for magnetic fields were higher than the corresponding power densities for all building wall materials. Infants, children, senior citizens, and patients all have relatively weak immune systems that are susceptible to radiation exposure. Therefore, it is important to design sensitive spaces using drywall and ceramic- or masonry-faced concrete walls.

All measured field exposures were significantly lower than the corresponding ICNIRP safety limits. However, the exposure intensities were significantly higher than the safety levels defined by many countries. Therefore, measuring exposure intensity is extremely important for preventing adverse thermal health effects. Emissions exceeding safety limits require appropriate countermeasures if they occur regularly. The exposure intensities measured in this study exceeded the safety limits defined by Switzerland, raising significant concerns regarding adverse health effects.

Although EMFs cannot be completely avoided, it is possible to achieve significant reduction in their magnitude. Key strategies for improving IEQ include the use of shielding materials, building spatial design, reduction in exposure time, increased distance from radiation sources, and complete avoidance of exposure to electronic devices in sensitive areas. In Qatar, there are no standards limiting EMF exposure at work or home. Although Qatar strives to create healthy environments through building construction, additional efforts are required to mitigate electromagnetic emissions inside buildings. The findings of this study are consistent with the results and implications presented in previous publications.",0

"4. Conclusions
The increase in the skin dose due to the longitudinal magnetic field of the v2 linac-MR
systems depends on the SSD (air gap), the photon beam field size, and the beam energy. Our
previous work showed that the surface dose for a conventional Varian 600C linac was 10–11%
for various SSDs (figure 8 in Keyvanloo et al (2012)). For SSDs between 100 and 120 cm,
increases in the skin dose range between ~6%–19% and ~1%–9% is seen for the 6 and 10 MV v2
systems, respectively. As the side of the square field is increased from 5cm to 20 cm the

increase in the skin dose of the 6 MV v2 system varies from ~10.5% to ~1.5%; for the 10 MV
v2 system the increase is ~6% for a 5 × 5cm2
 field, while a decrease of ~1.5% is observed for
a 20 × 20 cm2
 field. These results suggest that changes to the skin dose are not expected to be
a limitation in the clinical use of the v2 systems. This also validates that the fringe field of the
new magnet and yoke design does not produce clinically unacceptable skin dose. Further, the
relatively lower skin dose increase seen at 10 MV offers a possible advantage in future designs
of linac-MR prototypes.
An important result of this work is that the reduction in dose rate caused by the extended
SSDs of these linac-MR systems can be overcome by reshaping the flattening filter while
minimizing the increase in the skin dose. The proposed reshaped flattening filter increased
the dose rate of the v2 systems from 355 MU min−1
 with a conventional flattening filter, to
529 MU min−1
 (6 MV) or 604 MU min−1
 (10 MV). For both energies, the skin dose was
increased by ~2.6% using this reshaped filter. Treatment times on the v2 linac-MR would then
be comparable to current clinical linacs. Flattening filter redesign thus provides an effective
method of recovering the dose rate lost due to the increased SAD of the v2 system while minimizing the increase in skin dose",0

The achievement of the same clinical effect with a significantly lower (about 1/5) dosage of betahistine can be explained by the inhibition of the MAO-B by selegiline leading to higher serum concentrations of betahistine. This approach is in line with recent developments to bypass the first-pass effect of betahistine by transbuccal or intranasal application. Despite the substantial methodological limitations of such an observational study, this combined pharmacotherapy could be an alternative to a high-dosage monotherapy with betahistine of MD.",0
"Conclusions
This study investigated the effects of gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation on fibromyalgia. We were interested in whether rhythmic sensory stimulation would promote significant changes in fibromyalgia and associated symptoms, and whether treatment effects would differ between two distinct treatment parameters. Our results indicated that there were statistically significant changes from baseline in measures of fibromyalgia symptoms, pain interference, depression, and sleep quality. However, no significant between-group differences were observed. These preliminary findings suggest that gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation may decrease fibromyalgia symptoms and ease associated comorbidities, such as sleep disturbances and depression. Further research is needed to confirm the present results and to better elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying clinical responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation.",0
"6 Conclusion
In this research, we propose an E–M approach to obtain the coefficient estimation and perform regularization simultaneously for AFT model with a general loss function, such as, but not limited to, the Square loss, absolute loss, Huber’s loss, and Tukey’s loss, based on the right-censored survival data. Our proposed algorithms utilize the LASSO penalty, however, any other penalties may be applied.

The extensive simulation study and real data analysis show that the absolute loss and two robust losses have excellent prediction performance compared with Square loss when data consist of heavy-tail errors. Therefore, appropriate loss function should be selected in the AFT model to obtain reliable estimation and prediction. The squared loss function is more suitable when the survival data is closed to normal after log transformation; whereas, the absolute loss function provides a better fit when the survival data is skewed and/or consisting of heavy-tail errors. The two robust loss functions demonstrate similar prediction performance that is in-between the square and absolute loss performances, hence may be appropriate for both scenarios with acceptable estimation and prediction results. Other types of loss function that are not compared in the simulation study can also be applied to the AFT model with our proposed E–M algorithm when more suitable.

The proposed method based on the AFT model can be extended to the additive model (AM) (Friedman and Stuetzle 1981) with general loss functions. It can also incorporate the group structure of predictors (the pathway information of genes) into the high-dimensional survival data analysis. For example, the doubly regularized penalty (Wu and Wang 2013) can be adopted in our object function to take into account of the gene pathway information.",0

"Conclusion
The prevalence rates and intensities of US vis a vis its impact on SAC, keep increasing from year to year, leading to increase in the global population requiring chemotherapeutic intervention with PZQ. In view of the WHO strategic ambitious plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2020 [43] and the findings from this review stipulating that in the last decade, a PZQ distribution coverage of 45% has never been achieved for SAC, it is obvious that this goal, in the face of realities, might not be achieved just like the strategic plan for 2010. Our view is in agreement with the report that if WHO sustains the current treatment trend, elimination is achievable in 2030 [44]. It is imperative that annual control programmes be scaled up marginally, particularly in the African region of the WHO. While US-based researches should be sponsored at the grass-root level to unveil hidden endemic foci, adequate facilities for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) should be put in place in all schools globally.",0

This review illustrates how antipsychotics can be effective on several pathways central
for neural stemness, development, function, metabolism and signal transduction, and how
all the MoAs we describe for these drugs also appear functional in controlling cancercell growth, notably GBM. This tumor is known to display a noticeable heterogeneity in
cell composition and possesses incredible plasticity, thus switching to a reprogrammed
cell population according to the selective pressure generated by the current therapeutic
approaches. This feature makes it predisposed to resistance to therapy [11,101]. Such a
GBM biological behavior makes possible the option of using “dirty drugs”, i.e., compounds
provided with pleiotropic and multifaceted MoAs (Figure 2), as antipsychotics definitely
are. These drugs can hit widespread vulnerabilities of cancer cells and spare noncancer
cells, due to a conceivably different toxicity pattern.",0

 Exploration of how fibrinolysis is affected, particularly
through D-dimer levels, constitutes a promising marker
of AE attacks. A threshold level of D-dimers was shown
to differentiate between an abdominal attack during bradykinin or mast cell-mediated AE and abdominal pain of
other aetiologies. Thus, D-dimers could be useful in the
emergency setting for patients with abdominal pain to
determine an AE diagnosis versus other aetiologies. VEcadherin, a protein marker of vascular stress, could not
distinguish between mast cell-related AE and bradykinin-mediated AE, but presented a characteristic peak

practice for the differential diagnosis of these two physiopathological forms of AE, the identification of which determines the patients’ therapeutic management.",0

This is likely to be related to the implant design, patient selection, surgical technique and the biomechanical demands that patients put on their implants following surgery. However, the representative contribution of these elements is unknown and should remain a focus of future research. It is however, vital that surgeons are aware of the risk profile of this surgery and counsel their patients appropriately.

Trauma appears to have higher complication rates and overall cumulative percentage compared to inflammatory arthritis as an indication. There is however a paucity of literature on the complication rates associated with each indication and none in osteoarthritis independently. High aseptic loosening rates at over 10% in less than five years, regardless of the implant or indication and high rates of deep infection compared to other implants should be communicated to patients as part of preoperative consent.

Surgeons should be aware of differing complications related to their implant of choice with each having its own specific set of complications featuring more frequently with its use.",0
"CONCLUSION
The number of mosquito population varies according to seasonal variations. During
favourable periods, when the size of the mosquito population increases, the potential for
dengue infection in the humans also increases. The potential for the dengue transmission
requires the following four factors: (1) a number of susceptible humans, (2) a number of
mosquitoes, (3) virus transmission potential, and (4) a suitable climate.
The temperature plays a significant role in the dengue transmission and influences
the dynamic modelling of vector–host interaction. The most suitable temperature for
the dengue transmission is 28.7 ◦C. Rainfall provides breeding sites for the mosquitoes
to hatch and develop into the adult stage. Both factors have a significant impact to the
mosquito population and the dengue transmission dynamics. Our simulations confirm
the impact of climate to dengue transmission is significant and suggest that the greatest
potential of dengue transmission in Thailand occur in June to August which average
temperature is 28–29 ◦C in the mid of rainy season. The mosquito population reach their
peak three months before the peak of infection of mosquito and human. This study shows
the impacts of climate especially temperature and seasonal variation to the transmission of
dengue virus",0

According to the recommended malaria treatment policy, both AS/AQ and AL are suitable drugs for first-line purpose since both drugs recorded excellent PCR-corrected efficacies (i.e., 96.4% and 100%, resp.) and safety/tolerability profiles in children in this study. AL, however, appeared better than AS/AQ for several outcomes such as rapid parasitological clearance, resolution of symptoms, and biological tolerance. Pharmacovigilance research is needed to monitor safety following extensive deployment, especially when the use is indicated for pregnant women and for those with malaria comorbidities who constitute another vulnerable group.",0

ASD is a severe, lifelong disorder with serious emotional and financial consequences. This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies is needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD. We recommended further studies to investigate the correlations between the clinical response of vitamin D and the biochemical changes in ASD patients.",0
"4. Conclusion
A 3D scanning device was used to scan the surface of fractured rock specimens and extract the surface characteristics. The specimens were fractured in a hydraulic fracturing experiment. The scanned data were processed to produce a shaded relief model of the fractured specimen, a 3D scanning image and a contour map of the fractured surface, generating a clear and detailed representation of the fracture morphology and propagation. A new method is proposed to quantitatively study hydraulic fracturing. Using the 3D coordinates extracted from the scanner, the superficial area of the fractured surface and volume of the fractured specimen can be derived for quantitative analysis. The 3D scanning device for coal rock specimens is an efficient diagnostic tool for hydraulic fracture experiments.",0
"Conclusion
Marijuana use, especially prolonged years of use,
may increase the risk of hypertension mortality.
This cardiovascular risk associated with marijuana
use, may be greater than the cardiovascular risk
already established for cigarette smoking. We are
not disputing the possible medicinal benefits of standardized cannabis formulations; however, recreational use of marijuana should be approached
with caution. It is possible that discouraging
recreational marijuana use may ultimately impact
reductions in mortality from cardiovascular causes.
A purposeful longitudinal study modeled with inclusion of listed relevant limitations is recommended to
help evaluate this cause.",0

"Conclusion
Recognizing the passage of the seasons is perhaps something taken for granted in the northern
or far southern latitudes because there are so many obvious signs. However, tropical environments—like at Monte Alegre just 2˚ south of the equator—do not have any of those telltale
higher lattitude signs. There are no major changes in temperature, no changes of precipitation
from rain to snow, no significantly shorter or longer days and nights, and no widespread coordinated shedding or color change of tree foliage. Therefore, the passage of the seasons—i.e. a
solar year—is perhaps most recognizable by tracking the migration of the sun between southern and northern solstices. To do this, however, one needs a clear view of the horizon—which
is usually difficult in a rainforest environment—but Monte Alegre provides the necessary elevation above the forest canopy to view the horizons.
For paleoindian cultures, the river would have been the most efficient mode of travel, the
hills at Monte Alegre offered lithic tools and horizon sightings, and once there, tracking the
sun through rock art pictographs and tally marks allowed for them to mark the cyclic passage
of time in a rudimentary calendar. Armed with this visual aide, the ancient Amazonians could
better predict and schedule subsistence and social activities, like resource acquisition and ritual
ceremonies.
The results of this research have implications on the development of traditional astronomy
knowledge systems extending to the terminal Pleistocene. This was a critical moment in history when our human ancestors were faced with rapid changes to the global climate. We do
not know the extent to which paleoindians recognized these changes, but it is during this time
period that Monte Alegre first shows evidence for paleoindians using rock paintings. I’ve
argued here that the context of the rock paintings indicate a method of recording seasonal sky

observations in pictographs with enough precision that it could have helped them predict
cyclic patterns of resource availability in the local environment.
Archaeoastronomy sites like at Painel do Pilão are pushing further back in antiquity the
evidence for human use of astronomy observations to marke the passage of time. And even
though specific rock drawings can not be pinpointed to over 13,000 years ago, this research
helps establish that tropical cultures engaged and utilized sophisticated knowledge of astronomy maintained through rock art and possibly shared or reimagined by more recent cultures
who either inherited or rediscovered the ancient paintings as they traveled far afield throughout eastern South America.
Beyond the art and archaeoasronomy, the recovery of lithics and the reduction of a platform wall during the paleoindian period shows that the interior of the South American continent was being inhabited as early or earlier than many coastal sites. And the preence of rock
art during that initial period suggests that rock art as a form of archaeorecording may have
been an adaptive strategy consistent with pioneers who sought to familiarize themselves to a
new landscape.
Similar astronomy lore [26–28] is found among more recent cultures for village orientation
and construction in Amazonia [24, 29–32] and the Andean regions of South America [33–36],
for the layout of many platform plaza constructions in Mesoamerica [26, 37–39], and for the
medicine wheels, gnomons, and sun dagger rock art of Sun-watcher chiefs in North America’s
southwest and plains cultures [40–43].",0
"In summary, fPMSC culture supernatant was demonstrated to exhibit antioxidant ability, and to a certain extent, to reduce the apoptosis induced by H2O2, at least in part via activation of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway. This suggested that for the clinical application of MSCs, in addition to the cells themselves, the culture supernatant may also have potential therapeutic value. In addition to its antioxidative effects, the supernatant of MSCs may have other beneficial functions, which require further investigation.",0
"Conclusions
This all-Nordic, population-based cohort study found decreasing risk estimates of esophageal adenocarcinoma after antireflux medication and antireflux surgery, with levels of risk almost the same as that of the background population 15 years or more after treatment. The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was stable over time after antireflux surgery compared with medication, indicating that these treatment alternatives may be similarly associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. These findings support the hypothesis that antireflux medication and antireflux surgery are associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with GERD.

"4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a new type biosensor for high
sensitive and specific method for mRNA in complex biological samples
by using GO-protected DNA probe and DSN cascade amplification. The
platform showed as effective intracellular probe for tumor-related
mRNA detection, with the ability of low cytotoxicity, high resistance to
enzymatic degradation, and cellular permeability. Using T1 mRNA as a
target model, the detection limit of T1 mRNA in vitro reached 1 fM.
These are three orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional
hybridization assays. In addition, the proposed method not only detect
mRNA in living cells, but also useful for monitoring the dynamic in situ
mRNA change. We anticipate that the platform with specific recognition element (such as HP1) could potentially be applied to detect intracellular mRNA and be useful for the early diagnosis and prognosis of
the cancers.",0

"In conclusion, this meta-analysis updated previous studies and identified that cancer risk in female population was increased with accumulating years of night shift work. Given the expanding prevalence of shift work worldwide and heavy public burden of cancers, further researches, particularly large-size, high-score cohort studies are of great necessity to confirm the relationship between night shift work and cancer risk. Also, in-depth biological researches should be done to explore the mechanisms by which night shift work affects cancer risk. Knowing how night shift work serves as a risk factor for cancers might help establish and implement effective measures to protect female night shifters. Moreover, it is important that long-term night shift workers accept regular physical examination and cancer screening for potential malignancies, particularly breast cancer.",0
"Conclusions
An analytical method for loxoprofen was developed as TBDMS derivative by GC–MS. Under optimized conditions, the linearity, repeatability and accuracy of this method were suitable for the determination of loxoprofen. When applied to commercial tablet and patch products, loxoprofen was positively identified without background effects and interference. Urinary loxoprofen levels were monitored as highest level at 0.5 and 1 h following a single oral administration to three horses and to fall below its LOQ at 24 h. Therefore, the present method will be useful for pharmacokinetic study and doping test of similar acidic drugs including loxoprofen in horses.",0
"In conclusion, LS-3-134 is a novel arylamide phenylpiperazine with
over 100-fold selectivity for D3Rs over D2Rs that produces a behavioral
profile similar to other D3R-selective partial agonists and antagonists
whereby motivation to seek cocaine appears to be attenuated. This
finding adds further support to pursuing D3Rs as a target for cocaine
dependence medications development. Given that sex differences have
been observed in dopamine systems (Becker, 1999; Jackson et al.,
2006), including D3R-mediated responses (Klinker et al., 2017; Liu
et al., 2017; Martelle et al., 2014), future studies are needed to assess
whether females exhibit similar responses to LS-3-134 as males. It will
also be important to determine whether the effects of LS-3-134 persist
with repeated treatments (John et al., 2015).",0

"Conclusions
In this study, we designed an approach for detecting closely linked multiple association signals and performed the analysis in Nordic Holstein cattle for milk, fat and protein yields. The results showed we not only detected most of the well-known genes affecting these three milk yield traits but also detected additional candidate genes. Post-GWAS, we used information from the mammalian phenotype database and variant effect predictor to confirm known genes and causative mutations. In the meanwhile, we detected additional genes which might be contributing to variation in milk traits in Nordic Holstein cattle. Therefore, we concluded our approach can be used routinely for GWAS studies in dairy cattle.",0

In conclusion, our data indicated that rHMGB1-induced platelet aggregation and secretion via TLR4 receptors, NF-kappa B, and cGMP depended activation of the GPIIb/IIIa pathway.

"The overall conclusion from these studies is that mammalian cells possess one or more specific transport systems for iron uptake in a transferrin-independent manner, but there is no consensus as to the molecular identity of the transporters responsible for these uptake processes. But none of the studies in the literature proposes an NTBI transporter that accepts Fe3+ as the substrate; involvement of ferri-reductases that convert Fe3+ to Fe2+ before uptake via either ZIP8/ZIP14 or some other NTBI transporter is implicated in all of these studies. In contrast, the present study focused on citrate uptake and the involvement of Fe3+ in this uptake process. This approach has uncovered the presence of a novel transport system for citrate in mammalian cells that operates only in the presence of Fe3+ as well as Na+ under physiological conditions.",0

Based on the above study from 18 to 24 months of clinical pooled outcome, we concluded that both the Superion and X-STOP interspinous spacers can relieve symptoms of LSS. In addition, the pooled results indicate that Superion shows advantage than X-STOP in axial pain severity and ZCQ patient satisfaction score, whereas similar in other outcomes. The Superion spacer may represent a promising spacer for patient with LSS owing to its nature of minimally invasive, easily operable, and less damage. Because of the advantage of IPS technique, it would win a wide place in the future degenerative lumbar microsurgery.",0
"Population-based strategies to prevent diabetes and high BMI have great potential impact—not least because many NCDs have overlapping risk factors, comorbidities, and shared sequelae—but have so far often failed, largely because of reluctance by governments and policy makers to pursue structural interventions that tackle key risks for NCDs, such as diet and physical inactivity.1 Future efforts should focus on identifying the most effective clinical interventions to prevent development of NCDs in at-risk groups and their sequelae, such as cancer. Primary care interventions, such as glucose-modifying medications, can be effective in preventing diabetes complications such as macrovascular disease,50 but this approach relies on early identification and close monitoring of people with diabetes, which can be challenging in LMICs that have limited resources. As well as coordinated approaches to halt and reverse the rise in NCDs, global efforts and clinical guidance should reflect the importance of cancer as a sequela of both diabetes and high BMI, and NCD control measures should be integrated into clinical guidelines to identify opportunities to reduce morbidity in this group of patients.",0
"In the present study, we demonstrate the excellent activity of Etest and disk diffusion for evaluation of the activity of C-T against a population of beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. The C-T MIC distribution for the isolates evaluated in this study reflects that documented in larger databases, including the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) data (https://mic.eucast.org/Eucast2/regShow.jsp?Id=36537). The highest probability of testing errors would be for those isolates with MICs near the breakpoint, i.e., 8 to 32 μg/ml, as slight downward differences in MICs may result in VMEs. However, such isolates are rare (6.6% of all P. aeruginosa included in the EUCAST database and 7.5% included in the present study). In contrast, the MTS had a tendency to yield MICs that were 1 to 2 log2 dilutions higher than rBMD MICs, and as such, laboratories may consider carefully evaluating isolates with MICs in the intermediate range if using MTS, as these may be susceptible by rBMD.",0

"Conclusions
Our genome-wide comparative analysis of a comprehensive set of expressed rice gene homologues in the 48 diverse eukaryotic species reveals information regarding the recently evolved rice-specific genes and the ancient genes conserved across eukaryotes. The presence of a common set of 98 conserved genes across diverse eukaryotic species underlined their role in the basic structural and metabolic functions and helped provide a clue regarding the origin and diversification of these species. A eukaryotic tree of life based on the comprehensive set of the conserved genes increases our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among different plant, animal, fungal, and protist species. The grouping of protists within diverse clades emphasises their broad distribution and close association with the 3 eukaryotic clades—plants, animals, and fungi. In particular, S. rosetta provided a link between fungal and animal species, T. gondii provides a link between fungal and plant species, and C. reinhardtii is the nearest to the plant clade. The use of a comprehensive set of conserved gene sequences for estimating synonymous substitution rates and integration of fossil information provides more accurate estimation of the divergence time among a large number of species pairs by minimising the uncertainty associated with considering a small set of genes. This study provides novel information on the phylogenetic distances between some species pairs.

"In summary, SRI36160 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and does not affect STAT3 or mTORC1 signaling in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. SRI36160 displays potent in vitro anticancer activity, and is significantly less antiproliferative to non-cancerous cells. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated with cancer stem cell tumorigenic properties and the ability to self-renew, form differentiated progeny, and develop resistance to therapy [1, 9, 18]. When cancer cells were exposed to this compound in conditions designed to enrich for CICs, a more profound activity against cancer cell proliferation was observed. Our findings support the notion that selective inhibition of the Wnt/β pathway may provide a novel therapeutic approach for Wnt-dependent cancers.",0

In conclusion, we found that ANGPTL4 promoted MSCs survival under conditions that mimic those of the ischemic myocardium. It is likely that ANGPTL4 resists mitochondrial pre-apoptotic changes through integrin-dependent ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways, mimicking pathways activated when cells contacting with the ECM. Our findings propose a new way to protect MSCs from apoptosis, have a considerable therapeutic significance and provide the potential of now exploiting ANGPTL4 and MSCs clinically in cardiac regeneration therapies.",0

"4. Discussion and Conclusion
Many studies were published on the role of complementary and alternative medicines in treating cancer patients. Some studies support the CAM therapies to be beneficial for palliative cancer cares [30–35]. However, very few of the published reports support their efficacy with regard to the primary care of cancer. According to our knowledge, the clinical study, reported here, is the only prospective study that intrigued a fair number of complete and partial tumor responses along with impressive survival outcomes in treating patients with stomach, gall bladder, pancreatic, and liver cancers through psorinum therapy. Previously, interviews were conducted on 300 biopsy-proved cancer patients of Psorinum Therapy. The primary purpose of the study was to ascertain the patients' and/or their caregivers' view on this CAM therapy. The survey showed the patients had tried Psorinum Therapy mainly due to no other available treatment options, financial constraints, frustration with the conventional cancer treatments, and belief in the efficacy of the Psorinum Therapy. According to the survey, among the 300 cancer patients, 195 (65%) had consulted their oncologists before trying the therapy [17]. This therapy can be easily replicated by other practitioners in different clinical centers due to the following advantages.

The reagent to prepare the drug Psorinum is available. The specific dosing and the medicinal power are established. The medicine administration technique is easy as it can be taken orally.

The supportive treatments are adopted from the allopathic streams. The supportive treatments with homeopathic medicines are done by specific ailment versus specific medicine concept instead of the concept of specific patient versus specific medicine, making the homeopathic supportive cares easier to replicate. In a nutshell, we should remember that, 158 participants of histopathology or cytopathology confirmed stomach, gall bladder, pancreatic, and liver cancers were included in the final analysis at the end of the study. According to the AJCC TNM staging system, 39 (24.68%) were diagnosed at stage-III and 112 (70.89%) were diagnosed at stage-IV. The participants Karnofsky status was between 30–60% and ECOGstatus was between 2-3. The participants received the drug Psorinum along with allopathic and homeopathic supportive treatments without trying conventional or any other investigational cancer treatments. According to the RECIST criteria, radiological complete response occurred in 28 (17.72%) and partial response occurred in 56 (35.44%) participants. The limitation of this study is that it did not have any placebo or treatment control arm; therefore, it cannot be concluded that Psorinum Therapy is effective in improving the survival and the quality of life of the participants due to the academic rigours of the scientific clinical trials. This study also cannot rule out the effects of the implemented allopathic and homeopathic supportive measures in the observed results. However, the results of the study showed a fair number of complete and partial tumor responses along with impressive survival outcomes in difficult to treat cancer types. Therefore, randomized double-blind clinical trial, detailed molecular, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics studies should be conducted for further scientific exploration of this alternative cancer treatment to determine if it can be integrated into the mainstream oncology.

"In the end we discuss three countermeasures. The first one is that Alice uses an active phase randomization equipment30,31 to ensure that the phase of source is totally randomized, then our attack is automatically removed. Obviously, this method is the best way for Alice, since it can remove not only our hybrid measurement attack but also other undiscovered attacks based on the random phase of sources, but it may increase the complexity of the system, or introduce other potential and undiscovered loopholes. Note that even an active phase randomization equipment is used by Alice, it is still necessary for her to check the degree of phase randomization in the communication program (but not calibrate it before the communication) to ensure that the phase of source is really randomized in [0, 2π) and Eve does not break the efficiency of her active phase randomization equipment. The second one is that the legitimate parties carefully design the system parameters to ensure that Eve can not load our attack in these parameter regimes. This method is valid for our hybrid measurement attack, since they know which parameter regimes are secure if they clearly know the parameters of their system, but there may exist other potential hacking strategies so that Eve can also exploit the partially random phase to spy the final key in other parameter regimes. The third one is that the legitimate parties carefully monitor the experimental data but not only estimate the key rate with these experimental data. For example, they can check the rate of gain Qμ/Qν. In the parameters of Fig. 3, Qμ/Qν ≈ μ/ν = 4.8 when Eve is absent, but this rate will be changed to Qμ/Qν ≈ 7.79 when Eve is present, which is higher than the expectation 4.8.

"4. Conclusions
The goal of this study was to understand the effect of DSS on Caco-2 cell metabolism. Although cell viability was similar, and IL-6 production was increased approximately 1.5 times, the only major metabolite difference observed when Caco-2 cells were incubated with 1% DSS was a decrease in alanine concentration in the cell culture medium as compared with controls. Since the concentration of glutamine and other amino acids were unaffected, we ruled out the possibility that DSS inhibited alanine transport across the membrane. These results suggest that either transcription of alanine aminotransferase is inhibited, or the enzyme itself is inhibited. This study emphasizes that alanine aminotransferase has a direct relationship with inflammatory bowel disease, and in particular CD, and may provide a more thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of CD in addition to the metabolic mechanisms for DSS-induced colitis in animal models. Work is currently under way to determine how alanine aminotransferase is inhibited by DSS.",0

Further, it suggests that those who have suffered a nerve injury or other types of peripheral nerve pathology may be prone to RF EMF-induced pain. The fact that uninjured animals showed no response to RF EMF in this study is also in agreement with most scientific reports and the overwhelming view that, under normal circumstances, anthropogenic EMFs in the reported range causes no pain. Thus, this study offers a possible explanation for contradicting accounts on evoked pain by RF EMF and highlights nerve pathology as the crucial contributing factor to RF EMF-induced symptoms. These findings may prove valuable in developing a patient’s pain management protocol and inform future studies of EMF-pain phenotyping.",0
"Conclusions
Interventions to encourage moving from high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with elevated major depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced major depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes in light of these sex differences.",0
"Conclusions
(1) During the pure MSS fly ash thermal treatment, approximately 80 to 89% of Pb, 48 to 56% of Cd, 27 to 36% of Zn and 6 to 24% of Cu were volatilized. During this process, temperature was an important parameter and had significant influence on the volatilization of heavy metals, whereas residence time had the weakest effect, particularly for Pb and Cd, which easily volatize.

(2) Chlorinating agents exhibited an apparent promoting effect on heavy metals removal, particularly for the mid-volatile metals, Cu and Zn. With an addition of 10 wt% chlorinating agents, more than 96% of Pb, 78% of Cd, 76% of Zn (except NaCl) and 86% of Cu (except NaCl) can be removed from MSS ash. With an increase in Cl proportion, the evaporation rate of the heavy metals increased; however, the effect clearly varied. The NaCl had the weakest enhancement effect on the evaporation rate of Cd, Zn and Cu.

(3) The best choice of chlorinating agents is in the order of MgCl2 > CaCl2 > FeCl3 > AlCl3 > NaCl due to the metal removals (particularly Zn) and the low amount of remaining chlorine, which favors treated ash for further resource use or disposal.",0
"5. Conclusion
MI-3DVS-guided hepatectomy should be considered as the primary treatment for HCC patients with multifocal disease, higher AFP level, and preserved liver function within the Milan criteria. However, for older candidates, RFA can be considered as an alternative therapy, as it could lead to comparable survival but shorter hospital stay and lower incidence of complications. Intervention, tumor number, and serum AFP are important and independent prognostic predictors of both survival and recurrence.",0

"Conclusion
A major challenge in schizophrenia research has been identifying and characterizing the complex neurobiological effects of multiple conjoined genetic variants contributing to disease risk. Leveraging the combined power of neuroimaging and GWAS, this study supports a role for genes involved in synapse organization and function in prefrontal–hippocampal interactions. Several genes in this pathway are highly consistent with the reported risk architecture of schizophrenia, and we provide independent evidence for the intermediate phenotype concept. In addition, we identify genes that are strongly implicated in the schizophrenia pathophysiology but have not been identified by classic genetic association studies. Our findings highlight the value of this biologically driven method in determining the mechanisms and genes underlying intermediate systems-level neural phenotypes linked to psychiatric disorders and should be generalized to other phenotypes and disorders of interest. We expect that a more pathway-oriented approach will also be helpful in linking up systems-level observations in humans with drug development in psychiatric disorders.",0

"In conclusion, YL-0919 is a patented novel structural antidepressant reagent. Treatment with YL-0919 rapidly reverses the depressive-like behaviors induced by the CUS paradigm in rats. Increased mTOR-related dendritic complexity in the PFC may at least partially underlie the faster antidepressant action of YL-0919. This study provides a potentially promising future of faster onset and memory enhancing antidepressant.",1
"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, maximal aerobic exercise capacity was significantly reduced in adults born at VLBW compared to term-born controls. Given the relationship between exercise capacity and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, this could have significant implications for individuals’ long-term health. The variability in outcome measures assessing physical activity meant it was difficult to accurately assess the association with birthweight. We recommend a standardised approach of assessing physical activity levels for future studies, such as the European Respiratory Health Community Questionnaire II or Metabolic Equivalent of a Task levels.",1
"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study employed a stroke order animation learning system to investigate the effects of stroke order learning on
CSL learners’ recognition of characters with different complexities. The results of the orthographic discrimination task indicate that
learning the correct stroke order helps CSL learners form and consolidate high-quality orthographic representations of Chinese
characters, with a more prominent effect on the processing of characters with higher complexity. Furthermore, the high-quality
orthographic representations driven by correct stroke order learning enable learners to establish form-meaning associations more
effectively. Importantly, the facilitative effect of correct stroke order observed in this study was still present in the delayed test one
week later, suggesting that learning the correct stroke order helps CSL learners maintain long-term memory of character form and
semantics. ",1
"In conclusion, the data reveal that SFA suppresses PA-induced lipid accumulation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells, as well as HFD-induced liver injury and steatosis in C57BL/6J mice. This work contributes a new understanding with regard to the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of SFA on hepatic lipid deposition and apoptosis. This study suggests that SFA may be a potential candidate for the amelioration and prevention of NAFLD.",1
"Conclusion
In conclusion, high or moderate certainty evidence shows that resistance exercise with or without nutritional intervention and the combination of resistance and balance or aerobic exercise are the most effective interventions for improving quality of life in older adults with sarcopenia. Adding nutritional interventions to exercise had a larger effect on handgrip strength than exercise alone while showing a similar effect on other physical function measures to exercise alone. Moderate certainty evidence showed that adding balance training to resistance exercise was the most effective intervention for improving physical function measures. These findings can be used to guide the optimal exercise prescription for improving patient-important outcomes among older adults with sarcopenia.

Implications for practice
Evidence suggesting nicotine EC can aid in smoking cessation
is consistent across several comparisons. There is high-certainty
evidence that EC with nicotine increases quit rates at six months or
longer compared to NRT, and moderate-certainty evidence (limited
by imprecision) that EC with nicotine increases quit rates at six
months or longer compared to non-nicotine EC. There is now lowcertainty evidence (limited by risk of bias)that EC with nicotine may
increase quit rates compared to behavioural support alone or to no
support.
Issues with risk of bias, few studies, and diIerences between
studies preclude strong conclusions regarding the eIect of nicotine
EC when added to NRT, but the data available suggest a benefit.
None of the included studies (short to midterm, up to two years)
detected serious adverse events considered possibly related to EC
use.However, more long-term data are needed, and this conclusion
relates specifically to people using EC to quit smoking and not
to people who have never smoked. The most commonly-reported
adverse eIects are throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and
nausea, which tend to dissipate with continued use. In some
studies,reducedtoxinconcentrations andbiomarkers ofharmwere
observed in peoplewho smoked and switched to vaping, consistent
with reductions seen in people who stopped smoking without EC.
Implications for research
Further randomized controlled trials of nicotine EC are needed,
following up participants at six months or longer. Studies with
active comparators (i.e. comparing nicotine EC to frontline smoking
cessation pharmacotherapies) are likely to be of particular use
to decision-makers, as are those testing EC as an adjunct to
existing stop-smoking pharmacotherapies; in particular, those
testing combinations of traditional NRTs with e-cigarettes (e.g.
patch plus e-cigarettes).
All studies (including uncontrolled intervention cohort studies)
should aim to assess the safety profile of EC for as long as possible
(the current review only includes data up to two years), and ideally
be powered to detect diIerences in safety outcomes, particularly
serious adverse events. Safety results should be presented in both
absolute and relative risk terms (in comparison to the risks of
continuing to smoke tobacco).
Studies should oIer recent devices with good nicotine delivery to
participants to be mostrepresentative ofwhatwill be on the market
at the time results are released. Studies should also monitor and
collect data on participants switching use of other devices during
trials, and use of diIerentflavours and nicotine strengths.Protocols
and statistical analysis plans should be registered in advance and
openly available.
Further RCTs need to be adequately powered. Further trials of
pod and newer disposable devices would be of particular value,
as would RCTs providing ECs in a way that would be used in
real-world settings (e.g. taking into account individual preferences
for strengths and flavours of e-liquids and even EC devices,
and also allowing for changes in preferences over time). Further
studies directly comparing nicotine ECs based on characteristics
including nicotine content and delivery, flavour, and device type,
and reporting outcomes including cessation at six months or
longer, would also be particularly useful.
Further reviews, using the best available methods, need to be
conducted to evaluate the possible relationships between EC use
and availability and youth uptake of EC and conventional cigarettes
(such as Hartmann-Boyce 2022b), as well as the safety of EC use in
people who have never smoked.",1

"Conclusion
In this longitudinal study, confirmed osteosarcopenia prevalence increased from 3.0% at age 75 to 9.2% at age 85. Women with probable osteosarcopenia had significantly increased risk of hip and major osteoporotic fractures and mortality. Probable osteosarcopenia was also associated with higher frailty and lower physical functioning. The addition of sarcopenia to low bone mass markedly increases the risk of both fracture and mortality. To summarize, in older women the clinical approach should focus on the musculoskeletal system as a whole; in addition to screening for low bone mass, screening for, or at least being aware that low muscle strength is an additional clinical risk factor, could also be valuable.",1

Overall, in patients presenting with low NIHSS score and LVO of the proximal anterior circulation, we did not find better outcomes for patients treated with EVT compared with BMM. However, IVT was associated with increased odds of routine discharge and deceased LOS.

"Conclusions
The UK SDIL was proposed by the UK government to tackle childhood obesity. The pattern of findings of this study suggests that the SDIL can contribute to reducing obesity prevalence in older primary school children. The SDIL announcement and implementation was associated with an overall relative decrease in obesity prevalence in year 6 girls aged 10 to 11 years of approximately 8% compared to the counterfactual scenario based on pre-announcement trends. These associations were even greater in girls from schools in the 40% most deprived areas, suggesting the SDIL could help to reduce inequalities in child obesity. Further obesity reduction policies are needed alongside taxes on SSBs to improve and reverse the current obesity prevalence in children.",1

"Conclusions
The authors discovered 11 articles discussing interventions for reducing the negative impact of workplace violence among health workers. Psychologists and psychiatric nurses serve as counselors and facilitators in the activities that are carried out. Professional similarities between instructors and clients can be overcome by presenting instructors with higher levels of education such as specialists or high functional positions such as heads of professions in health workers such as heads of rooms or senior health workers. Intervention is provided in a comprehensive manner, taking into account both physical and psychological aspects in order to provide victims with protection, security, and comfort. The authors discovered three types of interventions: skill training programs, cognitive based training, and workplace violence program.

The implication of this study is that there is a foundation for the workplace to reduce the impact of workplace violence on health workers. This study also shows that counseling is an effort to reduce the impact of workplace violence and bullying in the workplace, so that workplaces such as hospitals can provide special counseling services for health workers. Apart from that, hospital management also needs to make policies related to the problem of workplace violence and bullying among health workers. So that the workplace becomes a safe and comfortable place in providing the best health services for patients. Management in the workplace can also form a special team to provide therapy such as cognitive therapy and training related to self-therapy to reduce the impact of workplace violence as an effort to reduce problems of workplace violence and bullying in the workplace. Future study with a systematic review and meta-analysis design are recommended for future research to assess the effectiveness of nursing interventions in reducing the negative impact of workplace violence among nurses.",1
"This study is one of the first investigating the neurogenic response of juvenile female
rats to an early life physiological stressor followed by an immune challenge in early
adolescence. The results suggest an interaction between MS and LPS that induces aberrant
microglial activity that could impact the dendritic complexity of new neurons in the juvenile
period and potentially also in later in life. Although we did not include subregion as a factor in
statistical analysis, the results of the current study still show that MS potentiated LPS-induced
increase in IL-1 in the vHi. However, there was no difference in sensitivity between the dHi
and vHi to MS or LPS-induced changes in microglial activation and the number of DCX positive
cells. On the other hand, it should be noted that MS exacerbated LPS-induced reductions in
complexity of distal dendrites of new neurons in whole hippocampus without a distinction
between the dHi and vHi. Finally, further research is needed to determine the effects of early
life (postnatal and juvenile) stress in females, on behavioural consequences particularly in

"Conclusion
We provide for the first time, the high-quality complete mitogenome of P. cyanocephala, a parakeet endemic to the Indian Subcontinent, whose existence is threatened by illegal bird trade. P. cyanocephala mitogenome consists of 37 genes and the gene arrangement shows conserved patterns like other parrots. We also report that D-loop region of P. cyanocephala mitogenome displays the ancestral avian CR gene order. Codon usage analysis revealed that third positions of the codons are dominated by either adenine or cytosine. The dN/dS results indicated that nad1 and nad4l are under the strongest purifying selection whereas nad6, nad5 and nad4 are under the lower selection pressure in P. cyanocephala. Furthermore, phylogenetic results provided concrete evidence of multiple clades/groups clustering within the Psittacula genus supporting the call for a taxonomic reconsideration of the Psittacula genus. The complete mitogenome sequence of P. cyanocephala provided here will help in future phylogenetic and phylogeography studies as well as increase our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of such endemic species. Furthermore, mitogenome data will be instrumental in designing forensic tools for improving the conservation efforts and preventing the illegal trading of parakeet species.",1

"In summary, CHMs should be prescribed by trained TCM practitioners to pregnant women for treating certain diseases or discomforts. The Giving single herbs to healthy pregnant rats or mice in a laboratory experiment is different from administering herbal formulas to pregnant women with diseases or symptoms in a clinical setting. Although animal studies are the standard method for evaluating drug-induced teratogenicity in modern toxicology, there are still significant differences between animals and the human body. The safety of the CHMs with a history of human use for thousands of years should not be simply denied by the experimental results from ten mice. Evaluation of teratogenic toxicity of CHM needs more sophistic design.",1
"CONCLUSION
Knowledge pertaining to glucagon based on recent findings from basic and clinical research, its clinical applications, and potential for therapeutic development in the future was outlined in the present paper. In particular, the close relationship between glucagon and amino acid metabolism shows that glucagon might be involved not only in glucose, but also in protein metabolism. The pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, especially diabetes, has been discussed in the context of dysfunction in insulin secretion and action. However, glucagon, which is equally important to insulin in systemic energy metabolism, must also be considered as a central player in future medical treatment for diabetes and metabolic diseases.",1

"CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed, discussed and evaluated currently available deep learning-based methods for CRISPR/Cas9 on- and off-target activity prediction. In each task, we focused on analyzing the existing predictors and assessing the performance on diverse datasets. To our best knowledge, this manuscript provides the comprehensive summary of currently available deep learning methods in on- and off-target activity prediction. It is complementary to existing reviews that focus on several methods and computational performance in sgRNA design.

We have surveyed 21 state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches for predicting sgRNA on-target activity. By collecting nine independent testing sets from various cell types, we benchmarked 10 representative approaches and demonstrated their performance. We divided data sources into small-, medium- and large-scale datasets. According to the comparative results obtained in this study, it can be illustrated that most approaches gained satisfactory performance on the large- and medium-scale datasets. Simultaneously, the small-scale datasets turned out to be a challenge for all predictors. How to efficiently train a model with limited data is an open problem for deep learning methods. We observed that models trained on the large- and medium-scale datasets achieved superior performance than those trained and tested on small-scale datasets. Hence, transfer learning specializes in tackling this challenge where the learned parameters of a model trained on large- and medium-scale datasets are shared to the targeted network. In addition, CRISPR-ONT is more robust among the compared predictors. AttnToCrispr_CNN and C-RNNCrispr performed well in small-scale dataset prediction.

Although deep learning has achieved superior performance for on-target activity prediction, there remain some aspects of interest to explore. First, interpretation and robustness are two crucial aspects for further development [136]. Increasing the amount of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing data shows great potential to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning-based predictors. The attention-based deep learning methods have been gradually applied in this domain [55, 58]. We have faith in future promising approaches incorporating deep learning and attention module should emerge in this field. Second, generalizability is also an important factor for deep leaning models in on-target activity prediction. Some recent works have shown that the integration of hand-crafted data may provide extra evidence on the prediction of sgRNA activity [30, 44]. However, the relationship between on-target activity and hand-crafted data is still to be thoroughly investigated. For instance, Chari et al. claimed that epigenetic status is an extra modulator of on-target activity considering DNase-seq and H3K4 trimethylation features [45]. Though incorporating epigenetic information may boost the prediction ability, it also brings about poor generalizability. This is because epigenetic information is highly variable cross-species and depends on cell type as well as cell state, which may further restrict the application of species- and cell type-specific predictions [24]. In this regard, how to effectively incorporate suitable biological information into prediction models remains a challenging problem for on-target activity prediction. Therefore, how to balance the prediction ability and generalizability is a critical issue for further study. In the future, computational biologists may focus on cell-state independent data to develop robust on-target activity predictors with interpretable features.

On the other hand, we provided a comprehensive overview of 15 most recently proposed deep learning-based off-target prediction approaches and analyzed their modeling details. It is worthy to note that data imbalance issue is a big challenge for model training and evaluation [30, 116]. Methods trained on imbalanced data tend to bias toward the major samples, thus achieving superior accuracy for the majority category. In contrast, for the minority category, which was really cared about on this issue, they generally perform worse [116]. We focused on the evaluation of the impact of IR for deep learning methods. Specifically, we performed extensive data analyses to compare performances of eight deep learning-based methods for nine datasets with three levels of IR (balance, mediate imbalance and severe imbalance). Most methods showed satisfactory performance on the balanced datasets. Compared with the excellent results on balanced datasets, the performance of methods evaluated on moderate- and severe-imbalanced datasets still has much room for improvement. Simultaneously, the severe imbalanced II6 dataset proved to be challenging for all methods. Therefore, it is important to construct benchmark datasets for developing any deep learning-based off-target predictors. In this regard, following study should focus on introducing predictors which use specific techniques to handle the data imbalance problem to predict off-target activity, probably by developing popular deep learning techniques such as resampling (e.g. SMOTE [137] and bootstrapping sampling), and robust loss function. The former aims to balance the samples in each batch while the latter targets to design robust loss functions to mitigate noise effects. For example, SMOTE is an oversampling strategy where the minority category is oversampled by synthesizing samples. In the strategy of robust loss functions, generalized cross-entropy (GCE) loss function incorporating mean absolute error and cross-entropy was recently applied to make GCE more robust and effective [138]. We observed that no model performs excellently on all datasets, indicating that it is necessary to carefully choose off-target activity prediction methods. In conclusion, we expect this review to be a steppingstone toward design and implementation of more efficient methods for both CRISPR/Cas9 on- and off-target activities in the future.

Key Points
This article summarized available deep learning-based methods related to CRISPR/Cas9 on- and off-target activity prediction.

We systematically evaluated the performance of 10 deep learning-based sgRNA on-target activity prediction tools on nine widely used datasets with various sample sizes including large, medium and small scale.

We also provided a comprehensive comparative assessment of eight existing deep learning-based methodologies for off-target prediction using 12 datasets with three levels of imbalance ratios including balance, moderate imbalance and severe imbalance.

This study provides insights to the scientific community to apply appropriate methods for CRISPR/Cas9 on- and off-target activity prediction.

"4. Conclusions
Dementia and depression are among the most common disorders of the elderly, having a major impact on quality of life for
patients and relatives, increased mortality, and substantial health
care and social costs [50,52]. The relationship between depression
and dementia is complex with depression having been reported
to be both a risk factor and a prodrome for Alzheimer’s disease
and other dementia’s, and also being a common complication of
dementia at all stages. Depression is common in dementia, and in
particular in patients with vascular dementia, and is often difficult to treat. This review has found convincing evidence to support
both early-life depression being associated with an increased risk
of dementia, and late-life depression being a prodrome of dementia. The mechanisms involved are complex and interlinking with
no single process explaining the relationship. When looking at the
causative/risk factor hypothesis it will be interesting to find out
whether future research looking at the treatment of mood disorders shows any reduction in risk of dementia. The prodromal
hypothesis highlights the need to carefully follow up individuals presenting with depression in old age for future cognitive
decline, especially when the first depressive episode occurs in
later life. Additionally, research drawing more confident conclusions about the underlying neurobiological pathways, may pave
the way for more effective treatment of both depression and
dementia.",1
"The causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, is capable of repeat infections in people, suggesting that the human immune response does not develop sufficiently broad or long-lasting immunity to cover treponemal diversity. Here, we examined the genomes from two blood-derived isolates of T. pallidum derived 6 years apart from a patient who had syphilis four times during the same period to understand the genetic basis of reinfection. We found a paucity of coding changes across the genome outside of the highly variable tprK gene. Using deep profiling of the full-length tprK gene, we found surprisingly that the two isolates did not share any full-length TprK sequences.",1
"Conclusion
The importance of predicting DDI potential has been discussed in many review articles, and PBPK modeling has been increasingly used for DDI predictions. This review provides a brief overview of PBPK model development and its application for DDI predictions. In addition, 107 PBPK modeling articles on the prediction of DDI potentials were identified, and the advantages of PBPK modeling, including capturing time-variable changes and inter-individual variability, have increased the number of articles published yearly. Although the articles reasonably predicted the DDI potentials in humans, investigation of DDI potentials using PBPK modeling was restricted to a limited number of drug metabolizing enzyme-mediated and transporter-mediated DDIs. In addition, the simulations were performed mostly in healthy adult populations. To widen the application scope of PBPK modeling in DDI predictions, more information on the physiological properties of the body and the incorporation of pathophysiological conditions in disease states are required. In addition, a harmonized in vitro experimental design is required for proper PBPK model building, and precise acceptance criteria should be set up for the validation process. Nevertheless, the outstanding achievements and progress in life sciences and computer technologies will soon solve these problems, and DDI predictions will be improved by the incorporation of in vitro data into PBPK models.

"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our study provides an overview of the changes in the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts across populations and the national or regional rate of death by suicide since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the overall rate of death by suicide remained basically unchanged during the pandemic, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were more prevalent compared with the pre-pandemic period, especially among the adult general population and clinical patients. Considering the heightened suicide risk factors, such as mental health problems and economic vulnerability during the pandemic, large-scale suicide screening for the public and timely intervention programs for high-risk groups are highly needed. The continuously changing pandemic underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and surveillance for suicidality.",1
". Conclusions
This paper provides coverage of the application of five popular computational algorithms in the IoT enabled Smart City. It provides a mapping of the various applications to the specific smart city domain as well as highlights the different formulations of the objective function used to solve the considered problem. This coverage is provided in terms of the number of objectives as well as whether the problem was solved as a single objective, in a hierarchical manner or otherwise. It also highlights the constraints used by the researchers in solving the problem which is an important aspect as constraints are governed by the application at hand. An overview of the mapping of various smart city optimization applications derived from this work is provided in Figure 9.

Figure 10 illustrate the distribution counts for each of the algorithms considered in this survey. It was found that genetic algorithms was found to be most commonly used optimization scheme as can be seen from Figure 10 and was used a total of 33 times in the approaches covered in the survey as has been observed by. This inspite of the fact that GAs are more computationally intensive than PSO with the latter being faster as well [154]. However, it must be noted that the performance of any optimization algorithm is problem dependent [154]. The PSO algorithm was used the most for smart grid applications whereas ACO and GA were equally used for Smart Transportation. When looking at the difference between the uses of bio-inspired (PSO, ACO, ABC) and nature-inspired (GA, DE) algorithms, it was observed that bio-inspired algorithms were used more times at 53 vs. 45 respectively as the proposed technique. This indicates that nature inspired algorithms, even though relatively newer, are getting increasing traction for use in various applications relating to Smart Cities.

Figure 11 illustrates the counts for the different ways in which the objective function was solved. It can be observed that even though there were nearly similar number of multiple and single objective function formulations (59 and 51 respectively), the solutions for these were mostly derived as a single problem. This meaning that the objectives were combined in some form (such as weighted combination of two or more objectives).

Another interesting observation from this review was on the formulations of similar standard combinatorial optimization problems within different smart city domains. For e.g., the vehicle routing problem exists in smart health (emergency vehicle routing), smart transportation (traffic routing and public transport routing) as well as in smart industry (routing for logistics). While, the objective of the routing problem in various papers was observed to target time incurred for the trip, the constraints incorporated domain knowledge in to the problem. That is, routing in the smart industry included constraints on visiting all depots while for smart health and smart transport, constraints included speed and road traffic. These insights highlight the difference in working on similar optimization problems in different smart city domains.
This review will help researchers in the field of computational optimization for smart cities to develop better problem formulations for the problems encountered in IoT based smart cities. It will also provide new researchers starting in the field by presenting them with an overview of the optimization scope within the IoT supported Smart City domain.",1
"In conclusion, our results documented a variable association of ambulatory peripheral and central BP, arterial stiffness and wave reflections with HMOD. The predictive value was high in case of cardiac damage, whereas it was marginal in case of carotid damage and impaired renal function. These findings corroborate previous evidence collected with a different technology and suggest that 24-h PWA, and in particular 24-h central SBP and PP, may be useful for predicting the risk of HMOD in hypertensive patients, at least when cardiac damage is considered. As our study is currently the largest one evaluating the relation between ambulatory peripheral and central hemodynamics and stiffness and HMOD in hypertensive patients based on a specific technology, the evidence collected will help provide some reference to clinicians making use of the same device employed in this study, for the routine clinical evaluation of their patients. However, we acknowledge that prospective data are warranted to confirm the clinical value of the technology in this context. Such data will be collected in the longitudinal phase of the VASOTENS Registry.",1
"4.7. General conclusion
The current meta-analysis is the first to synthesise research on associations between the
ERI model and physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Based on the unadjusted
r findings, hypertension, IMT and fibrinogen were most associated with ERI, while
triglycerides, IMT and hypertension were most associated with OC. Associations with
cardiovascular measures and both ERI and OC suggest that those seeking to intervene in the
work-stress- illness relationship should consider objective workplace efforts and rewards,
perceptions of workplace stress, as well as non-adaptive work characteristics and behaviours
when seeking to reduce the impact of work stress on CVD.",1

"5. Conclusion
This study suggested that EA at bilateral Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) acupoints can enhance the sedative effects on propofol anesthesia in low-frequency stimulation but reduce the sedative effects in high-frequency stimulation (50 Hz). Low-frequency EA affected the sympathetic-vagal balance, which increased vagal activity and decreased sympathetic activity in ratios. In light of these results, the effectiveness of the sedative effects of EA in the perioperative period is promising.",1
"Conclusion
In this protocol, a randomized controlled neuroimaging trial is outlined, of which the main purposes are to evaluate the efficacy of TA and SA (acupuncture and placebo acupuncture) treatment for migraine and to investigate the central mechanisms of TA and SA. The results and findings of this study will help provide a new perspective to illustrate the mechanism of acupuncture treatment, thereby promoting the widespread application of acupuncture and offering more benefits for patients affected by migraine in the future.",1
"6 Conclusions
In this paper, a chronic disease diagnosis framework combining unsupervised learning and uncertainty is proposed. The time-contrastive learning method used in unsupervised learning leverages graph neural network (GNN) to capture the high-order inter-correlation and intra-correlation of the multivariate time series. Take one of the most common chronic disease—Parkinson’s disease (PD) for example, experiments are carried out based on two Parkinson's disease data sets and eight well-known benchmarks. The results show that our method achieved superior performance. The visualization of unsupervised encoder representation and related uncertainty experiments also shows that the proposed unsupervised learning and uncertainty modeling methods are effective. Based on the uncertainty quantification, samples whose data distribution deviates from the cognitive range of the model can be captured and then human experts can judge the samples further. Note that although the proposed framework is evaluated based on Parkinson's disease data sets, it can also be applied to other chronic disease time series data sets. However, at present, the graph structure is only constructed based on the simplest Euclidean distance measurement, so the performance is limited. To achieve better performance, future work will focus on constructing more efficient graph structure to further improve the unsupervised learning encoder.",1

In conclusion, the three techniques which were

"6. Conclusions and future directions
In conclusion, many factors in the domains of mental, physical, and social health have been associated with various aspects of DED, both symptoms and signs, and other ocular surface diseases. Most associations have been examined cross-sectionally and thus there is a need for future studies that examine these questions longitudinally, taking into account relevant confounders, and acknowledging the multifactorial nature of DED. Mechanistic and animal studies may also lend support in robustly studying relationships between various lifestyle challenges and the ocular surface.
Overall, the key messages that can be extracted from the lifestyle challenges section are:
●
Different studies across multiple geographies and populations have noted relationships between mental health indices (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress) and DED. The link is stronger for DED symptoms rather than for signs. Mechanisms underlying these associations are not clear and guidance on optimal therapy for individuals with DED and a comorbid psychological diagnosis is lacking.
●
Current evidence supports a strong association between sleep disorders (quality and quantity of sleep) and DED symptoms, for any cause or type of sleep disorder. Further research is required to evaluate whether this relationship remains significant after adjusting for underlying psychosocial disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) that is present to some degree in almost all sleep disorder cases.
●
Obesity has been linked to abnormalities in meibomian gland function and eyelid architecture. Comorbid conditions such as sleep apnea may contribute to the noted association.
●
Face mask wear has emerged as a new risk factor for DED, particularly evaporative DED and meibomian gland dysfunction.
●
Sexual and reproductive issues are common in adulthood, and, as a whole, have been linked to various aspects of DED. The mechanisms underlying many of these associations are not clear and require further study. Furthermore, there is a need to identify and study therapeutic and preventive strategies.
●
Solid evidence supports comorbidity between chronic pain conditions --specifically migraine, chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia– and DED. While reports principally focus on symptoms of DED, heterogeneity of the literature calls for additional data on the impact of chronic pain on DED signs and subtype (evaporative versus aqueous deficient). Moreover, further efforts should be devoted to standardizing pain measures to facilitate comparison across studies.
●
The effect of recreational drugs on the eye is dependent on the actions of that drugs and its method of delivery into the body. Since recreational drugs are typically illegal, the literature lacks case-control studies and relies heavily on publications that are either case reports or case series.",1

Abstract
Acute liver injury (ALI) is a globally important public health issue that, when severe, rapidly progresses to acute liver failure, seriously compromising the life safety of patients. The pathogenesis of ALI is defined by massive cell death in the liver, which triggers a cascade of immune responses. Studies have shown that the aberrant activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an important role in various types of ALI and that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes various types of programmed cell death (PCD), and these cell death effectors can in turn regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inextricably linked to PCD. In this review, we summarize the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and PCD in various types of ALI (APAP, liver ischemia reperfusion, CCl4, alcohol, Con A, and LPS/D-GalN induced ALI) and analyze the underlying mechanisms to provide references for future relevant studies.
Keywords: acute liver injury; NLRP3 inflammasome; programmed cell death
1. Introduction
The liver is the largest parenchymal organ in the human body and is the key hub of many physiological processes, including nutrient metabolism, blood volume regulation, immune regulation, and detoxification [1,2]. As such, the normal physiological structure and function of the liver are essential for maintaining human health [3]. Liver failure, due to various factors, is a global health problem. Acute liver injury (ALI) is a common disease that seriously threatens the health of patients, and the massive death of hepatocytes in patients within a short period of time leads to a dramatic decline in their liver function [4]. The etiology of ALI can generally be defined as either drug-induced liver injury, ischemia-reperfusion liver injury, autoimmune liver injury, or viral liver injury [5,6]; viral causes predominate in developing countries while drug causes predominate in developed countries such as the United States and Western Europe [7]. ALI progresses rapidly, and once acute liver failure has occurred, liver transplantation is the only effective treatment [8]; however, the scarcity of liver sources, the cost, and high mortality rates after urgent transplantation limit its application [9]. Various causes of innate immunity drive a local sterile inflammatory response and are the most direct cause of liver injury and failure [10], so it is particularly important to better understand the immune response in ALI and inhibit its progression.
The nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the most widely studied of the inflammasomes. It is composed of a sensor (NLRP3), an adapter (apoptosis-associated spotted protein, ASC), and an effector (cysteine aspartate protease 1, caspase-1) [11,12]. The level of NLRP3 expression under steady-state conditions is insufficient for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [13]. Thus, its activation requires two steps [14,15,16]. Signal 1 (pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cell factors) stimulates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), activating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ĸB) and promoting its translocation to the nucleus [17,18]; this then upregulates the expression of NLRP3, pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and pro-interleukin-18 (IL-18) [19]. Signal 2 (damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PAMPs) then induces NLRP3 protein oligomerization, recruits the ASC and pro-caspase-1 molecules [20], and then interacts with them to assemble the NLRP3 inflammasome, activating caspase-1 [15,21]. On the one hand, activated caspase-1 promotes the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18 [22]. On the other hand, activated caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) and releases its N-terminal domain, which translocates to the cell membrane and forms pores, leading to the release of cellular contents such as IL-1β and IL-18, inducing pyroptosis (Figure 1) [13,15,23,24]. Studies have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in various diseases throughout the body, including chronic liver injury (viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.) and ALI [25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32].

Biologists have long regarded cell death as an inevitable, passive outcome of life. However, as research has developed over the past few decades, studies have shown that organisms can actively clear damaged, harmful, and superfluous cells through certain specific cell death programs; this process is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of the human body environment [33,34]. Depending on whether the cell death process can be regulated, it can be classified as either accidental cell death (ACD) or regulated cell death (RCD) [35]. ACD is uncontrollable, mainly because the cells are subjected to extreme physical, chemical, or mechanical stimuli (e.g., high temperature, high pressure, pH changes, and shear forces). However, RCD is induced by precise molecular mechanisms that intervene in regulated cell death at the biological level [36]. RCD that occurs under physiological conditions that lack any exogenous environmental disturbance is also known as programmed cell death (PCD); this category includes apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy, among other forms [37,38,39,40]. In recent years, intensive research into the molecular mechanisms at play during cell death has shown that multiple effectors of PCD can regulate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can also lead to different forms of PCD, indicating that PCD is inseparable from the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [41,42,43]. In addition, with the rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology, several results of liver transcriptomic analysis have further demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to various regulatory and effector factors of PCD [44,45,46,47]. In this review, we focused on current studies regarding the NLRP3 inflammasome and PCD in ALI and analyzed the underlying mechanisms to provide references for future research and treatment of ALI.
2. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death
PCD is an active, orderly mode of cell death that is encoded in specific genes. Different types of PCD differ in their morphological features, signaling both the pathways and their resulting outcomes; here, we will mainly discuss the characteristics of the following types of PCD and their mutual regulation with the NLRP3 inflammasome: apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy.
2.1. Apoptosis
As the first to be defined in the literature, apoptosis is the most classic form of PCD [48,49,50]. Apoptosis was first observed in 1842 by Karl Vogt during cell growth and development in toads and was then formally described by Kerr in 1972 [51,52]. The main morphological characteristics of apoptosis are cell deformation, loss of cell membrane integrity, DNA degradation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (Figure 2) [53]. According to their inducing factors, cases of apoptosis can be divided into cell mitochondria/caspase-9 mediated endogenous apoptosis and death receptor/caspase-8 mediated exogenous apoptosis [54,55,56]. Although the initiation signaling pathways vary, all cases share common downstream pathways that culminate in the execution of apoptosis through a family of caspases (Caspase-3, -6, -7) [41,57,58]. Studies have shown that the family of caspases, which are initiators and executors of apoptosis, can promote the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing potassium ion efflux [59,60]. In addition, several different effectors of apoptosis, such as the Bcl-2-associated X protein and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer, can regulate mitochondrial homeostasis and thereby induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation [61]. However, there are also some effectors of apoptosis that have diametrically opposite effects; for example, cytochrome c released from the inner mitochondrial membrane upon apoptosis can competitively bind to the LRR domain of NLRP3, thereby inhibiting its activation [62,63]. The intrinsic link between apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation is complex, and so a careful distinction between the two is required when judging the relationship between apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome in disease.

2.2. Necroptosis
Necroptosis is another type of PCD that occurs when the normal apoptotic pathway of cells is inhibited [64,65]. In 1998, Vercammen et al. found that fibrosarcoma cells induced a controlled form of necrosis in the absence of caspase [66]. In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis does not affect karyopyknosis, nor produce nucleosome DNA fragments, which are mainly manifested through mitochondrial dysfunction, organelle disruption, and leakage of cell contents [67,68]. According to various inducing factors, necroptosis is divided into tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α)-induced external necroptosis, intrinsic necroptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and endogenous necroptosis induced by ischemia [69]. Of these, TNF-α-mediated necroptosis is the most prevalent form in the literature and is widely studied [64,70]. The activation of receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is key in the necroptosis pathway, and studies have shown that they can promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation through multiple pathways [71,72,73,74]. In addition, Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), a recently discovered effector of necroptosis, has also been shown to play an important role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation [75,76].
2.3. Pyroptosis
Pyroptosis is a type of programmed necrosis that is dependent on the gasdermin family [37]. In 1992, Zychlinsky et al. discovered pyroptosis in Shigella flexneri-induced macrophages, but incorrectly classified it as a specific category of apoptosis [77]. It was not until 2001 that Cookson formally proposed the concept of pyroptosis, defined as caspase-1-dependent inflammatory programmed cell death [78]. It is mainly characterized by cell swelling, pyknosis of the nucleus and DNA fragmentation, and the rupture of the cell membrane to form pores that then release a large number of inflammatory factors [79,80]. The occurrence of pyroptosis is mainly divided into the caspase-1-dependent canonical pathway and the caspase-4, -5, -11-dependent non-canonical pathway [79,81,82,83]. Pyroptosis is the most closely related form of PCD to the NLRP3 inflammasome, as the canonical pyroptosis pathway can be initiated by caspase-1 and the inflammasome initiates caspase-1 activation, of which the NLRP3 inflammasome is currently the most extensively studied [84].
2.4. Autophagy
Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent phagocytic phenomenon that is genetically regulated and is also considered a type II PCD [85]. Autophagy plays a role in the energy cycle and in maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading proteins and damaged organelles inside the cell [86,87,88,89,90]. The primary morphological feature of autophagy is the formation and accumulation of either crescent-like or cup-shaped phagocytic vacuoles [91,92]. Autophagy can be divided into non-selective autophagy, such as macroautophagy and microautophagy, and selective autophagy, which includes mitophagy, peroxisomal autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum autophagy, as well as ribosomal autophagy, among others [87,93]. Macroautophagy is currently the most widely studied form of autophagy; in general, the word autophagy is used to refer to macroautophagy. Autophagy is reciprocally regulated with the NLRP3 inflammasome and can either reduce DAMPs release by removing damaged organelles [94], thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation [95,96,97], or inhibit its activation by engulfing and degrading NLRP3 inflammasome components [98,99,100,101]. The NLRP3 inflammasome can also inhibit autophagy activation through autophagy protein interactions [102,103,104].
3. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in ALI
The NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as various forms of PCD, have been shown to play important roles in the pathogenesis of ALI, and their in-depth study has contributed to the development of new therapeutic strategies for ALI. Here, we summarize both the pathogenesis of the NLRP3 inflammasome and PCD in various types of ALI and the latest therapeutic strategies targeting them.
3.1. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in Acetaminophen (APAP)-Induced Acute Liver Injury
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the main form of acute liver injury in developed countries [105,106]. APAP is a widely used antipyretic and analgesic drug that is safe to use at therapeutic doses [107,108]. However, when it is over-used it can produce dose-dependent hepatotoxicity and even liver failure [109]. APAP-induced acute liver injury is the leading cause of drug-induced liver injury in western countries; in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the greatest predisposition for cases of acute liver failure is the excessive use of APAP [110,111,112]. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the only clinically approved drug for the treatment of APAP-induced liver injury. However, the NAC therapeutic window is quite narrow and can have adverse effects [113,114,115]. At a normal dose, APAP is converted in the liver, primarily by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT), into a nontoxic compound and excreted with urine; only a small amount is metabolized to n-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) [116]. NAPQI is a highly reactive intermediate compound that is cytotoxic and can be rapidly detoxified in combination with glutathione (GSH) in the liver [117,118]. However, once GSH is depleted, NAPQI covalently binds to protein sulfhydryl groups, especially in the mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress, and thereby inducing hepatocytes to undergo both apoptosis and necrosis [119,120,121]. Mice are preferred for studying APAP overdose because the doses of APAP that cause toxicity are similar in mice and humans, and the mechanisms of toxicity are similar in mice and humans. However, the time course of liver injury differs slightly between humans and mice, with hepatotoxicity developing slightly faster in mice, peaking at around 12–24 h compared with 24–72 h in humans [122].
In recent years, increasing evidence has demonstrated that apoptosis plays an important role in APAP-induced liver injury; tune staining has also demonstrated that hepatocytes underwent massive apoptosis in an APAP-induced acute liver injury model in mice [123,124]. Kaempferol (KA), a flavonoid compound extracted from Penthorum chinense, has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Du et al. found that KA inhibited the high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1)/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby protecting the liver from APAP-induced inflammatory responses and apoptosis [125]. Elshal et al. found that diacerein reduced NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β by downregulating the IL-4/Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and TNF-α/ NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathways and mediating oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, necrosis, sterile inflammation, and apoptosis, thereby preventing and reversing APAP hepatotoxicity in mice [126]. In addition, recent studies have shown that pyroptosis and necroptosis also play a role in APAP-induced acute liver injury. Wang et al. found that targeting mitochondrial ROS (via peroxidase 3) inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevented APAP-induced pyroptosis, thereby exerting hepatoprotective effects [127]. Receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (RIPK1) and RIPK3 play important roles in necroptosis, and Deutsch et al. found that in APAP mediated ALI, RIPK3 deletion or specifically blocking RIPK1 using Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of RIPK1, was protective against liver injury and associated with inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation [128]. Another study suggested that Nec-1 attenuates APAP-induced liver injury by inhibiting the interaction between necroptosis and the NLRP3 inflammasome [129].
3.2. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury
Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI), an inevitable pathophysiological process that occurs during several clinical procedures, such as liver transplantation and liver resection, is a common type of acute liver injury [130]. Severe LIRI causes liver dysfunction and failure, which leads to surgical failure [131,132]. To date, no effective method for the prevention and treatment of LIRI has been found. Therefore, in order to provide a clinical solution to this problem, it is important to deeply investigate the pathogenesis of LIRI. LIRI can be divided into two phases, ischemia and reperfusion, which are characterized by hypoxia-induced cell injury in the ischemic phase and immunoinflammation after the restoration of blood flow [133]. During ischemia, ROS production as well as organelle damage, are induced by glycogen depletion, inadequate oxygen supply, and ATP depletion, which can lead to hepatocyte injury and death [134,135]. Subsequent reperfusion not only causes cellular metabolic disorders but also triggers a series of inflammatory cascades, exacerbating hepatocyte injury [10]. LIRI can be divided into warm ischemia and cold ischemia. Except for liver transplantation, partial hepatectomy, trauma as well as hemorrhagic shock were warm ischemia. The warm rodent model (orthotopic) LIRI model is the most widely used because of its high feasibility, few ethical concerns, and low expense [136].
There are many different pathways of PCD, all of which can initiate inflammatory immune cascades during LIRI [10]. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to play an important role in LIRI pathogenesis, regulating hepatocyte injury, immune cell activation, and hepatic inflammatory responses [137,138]. Inoue et al. found that NLRP3 expression was elevated in a murine partial (70%) hepatic warm ischemia-reperfusion model, but that NLRP3-/- mice showed reduced levels of inflammation and apoptosis; the authors suggested that NLRP3 regulated neutrophil function by influencing chemokine-mediated signaling [139]. γ- Oryzanol (ORY), an important bioactive ingredient isolated from rice bran oil, has anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation properties and can exert protective effects in a variety of liver disease models [140,141]. Du et al. found that ORY protected the liver from I/R-induced inflammasome activation and apoptosis by inhibiting the HMGB1/NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathway by establishing a hepatic 70% warm ischemia-reperfusion model after mice were fed ORY for seven days [142]. Studies have also shown that dietary restrictions exert protective effects in IRI in multiple organs, including the liver [143,144]. Miyauchi et al. found that twelve hours of fasting enhanced β-Hydroxybutyric acid expression, promoting the up-regulated expression of acetylated histone-3 and the activation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and enabling NF-κB and NLRP3 inactivation, thereby playing a protective role against LIRI-caused hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis [145]. El-Sisi et al. found that octreotide could also play a protective role in LIRI by disrupting TLR4-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, and then inhibiting pyroptosis-triggered apoptosis [146].
An increasing number of studies have focused on the interaction between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome in LIRI. Cao et al. found that pretreatment with 25 hydroxycholesterol (25HC)-activated mitophagy inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activity in a rat LIRI model; the protective effects on the liver and the inhibitory effect of the NLRP3 inflammasome were attenuated after the inhibition of mitophagy, suggesting that the effect of 25HC pretreatment on LIRI may depend on upregulating mitophagy and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation [147]. Xue et al. demonstrated that lycopene promotes nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ HO-1 pathway activation and further inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by enhancing pooled autophagy, thereby alleviating LIRI [148]. Wang et al. found that Eva1a inhibited NLRP3 activation, thereby alleviating LIRI by inducing Kupffer cell autophagy [149]. Zhang et al. found that transient receptor potential melastatin 2 knockdown attenuated hepatocyte oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced cell injury by enhancing autophagy and negatively regulated the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. In addition, the use of INF39, an inhibitor of NLRP3, could increase cell viability and reduce cell apoptosis caused by OGD/R [150].
3.3. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in CCl4-Induced Acute Liver Injury
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), an industrial solvent that causes the necrosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes in the centrilobular region, is a typical hepatotoxicant [151,152]. CCl4 is metabolized in the liver into trichloromethyl radical and peroxyl radical by cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP2E1). The trichloromethyl radical can cause a peroxidation chain reaction to produce more toxic free radicals (such as superoxide and hydroxide anions), leading to free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation (membrane rupture, loss of membrane integrity) and thus liver cell damage [153,154]. Acute liver injury induced by CCl4 in animals is extremely similar to acute chemical liver injury in humans and is therefore widely used to investigate potential hepatoprotective strategies [155].
Salidroside (Sal), the active component of the plant salidroside, has many effects, including the inhibition of inflammatory responses. Zhang et al. found that Sal exerts protective effects against CCl4-induced ALI by reducing hepatocyte apoptosis, inhibiting oxidative stress, and reducing inflammatory responses by downregulating CYP2E1 expression and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation [156]. Zhao et al. found that Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorated acute liver injury via autophagy and may be associated with the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway [157].
3.4. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in Alcohol-Induced Acute Liver Injury
Alcoholic liver injury is the most common cause of liver injury worldwide [158,159]. Drinking a lot in a short period of time can cause acute liver damage, even liver failure, and the mortality rate is as high as 44% [160]. Excessive drinking will activate the CYP2E1 in the liver, resulting in the excessive production and accumulation of ROS, and enhancing lipid peroxidation, leading to the swelling and disintegration of liver cells [161,162,163]. To date, only a few corticosteroid drugs are clinically available to treat alcohol-induced acute liver injury, and their efficacy remains unsatisfactory [164].
Liu et al. found that quercetin can reduce ROS production by inducing the expression of HO-1 and then downregulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory bodies and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines to protect the liver from acute alcohol attack [164]. However, in the above studies, there was no further examination of whether NLRP3 inflammatory bodies could also regulate the PCD process.
3.5. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in Con A-Induced Autoimmune Hepatitis
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a complex hepatic inflammatory disease mediated by autoimmune reactions, can present in both acute and chronic forms [165]. Its clinical features are characterized by elevated serum transaminases, high γ- Hypogammaglobulinemia, autoantibody positivity, and interface hepatitis, with a predominance of lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates [166]. It occurs worldwide, with a relatively high incidence in European and American countries, and severe cases can rapidly progress to acute liver failure. Concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin extracted from concanavalin, causes liver injury via the tail vein injection of Con A and is a model of acute hepatitis because the damage it causes usually lasts only 48 h [6]. Most of its pathogenic features are similar to those of patients with clinical acute autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); as such, it has become one of the most commonly used research models for AIH [167,168].
Studies have shown that, in a Con A-induced ALI model in mice, the signal pathway involved in pyroptosis was significantly enhanced, which proved that pyroptosis was a key cell death event in AIH [169]. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a widely distributed natural compound derived from the secondary metabolites of Brassicaceae plants; it has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [170,171]. Wang et al., by constructing a Con A-induced acute immune liver injury model in mice, found that PEITC could reduce NLRP3 production and casp1 and GSDMD cleavage in the liver of ALI-suffering mice and directly interact with the cysteine at position 191 of GSDMD to inhibit hepatocyte pyroptosis, thereby exerting a significant hepatoprotective effect [172]. The work of Shi et al. showed that dimethyl fumarate promoted NLRP3 phosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues at specific sites of protein kinase A (PKA) and enhanced PKA signaling to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, pyroptosis, and IL-1 β Secretion, thereby treating Con A-induced AIH [173]. Deutsch et al. found that RIPK3 deletion was protective in Con A-induced AIH, whereas RIPK1 inhibition using Nec-1 exacerbated liver injury, and this effect was associated with increased hepatocyte apoptosis [128].
3.6. NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in LPS/D-GalN-Induced Acute Liver Injury
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-GalN) is a common hepatotoxic substance [174]. LPS/D-GalN combined with intraperitoneal injection can cause the diffuse necrosis of liver cells; this process is similar to the changes in liver pathology that occur after clinical acute viral hepatitis. Therefore, the animal model of ALI induced by LPS/D-GalN is widely used to explore the mechanism of clinical fulminant liver failure and test potential therapeutic drugs [175,176,177]. ALI induced by LPS/D-GalN overproduces TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and other inflammatory cytokines, which together lead to the necrosis of liver cells and liver failure [178,179].
NLRP3-Inflammed Bodies and Autophagy Seem to Play an Important Role in LPS/D-GalN-Induced ALI. Several research groups have shown that natural products, such as Biochanin A, daphnetin, Licochalcone A, Mangiferin, and Salvia miltiorrhiza can reduce LPS/D-GalN-induced ALI by inducing autophagy to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [180,181,182,183,184]. Furthermore, Yang et al. found that maresin 1 could inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase/NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis to ameliorate inflammation during LPS/D-GalN-induced ALI [185]. IL-1 exerts its effects through the cell surface interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1). Gehrke et al. found that LPS/D-GalN-induced acute liver injury was significantly attenuated in IL-1R1Hep-/- mice, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and cell apoptosis were significantly inhibited, and the use of anakinra, an IL-1R antagonist, had the same effect [186]. S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) is an important novel DAMP molecule that plays an important role in necroptosis. Bai et al. found that Paquinimod (an inhibitor of S100A9) significantly inhibited necroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in D-GalN/LPS-induced acute liver injury, thereby attenuating ALI [187].
4. Conclusions
The incidence of liver disease is increasing year by year and is the leading cause of death worldwide, and the immune response is central to almost all acute and chronic liver diseases. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in host immune responses; However, its aberrant activation promotes the development of multiple chronic liver diseases (including viral hepatitis, alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver cancer, among others) and ALI. ALI seriously threatens human health and quality of life and understanding how cell damage in the liver participates in the pathological process of ALI, no matter the cause, is the key to finding hepatoprotective measures. The role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in ALI has been widely recognized, and research on NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been intensive. A large number of studies have shown that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inextricably linked to various types of PCD.
In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis of different types of ALI and discuss the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and PCD therein (Table 1). The pathogeneses of various types of ALI are different, but a ROS signaling imbalance and an oxidative stress response seem to play a key role in all types. Several natural compounds ameliorate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and PCD in ALI by regulating oxidative stress and inhibiting the production of ROS. However, the specific targets of these compounds are not clear, and previous studies have been mostly based on animal models and cellular levels. The research is still lacking in vivo experimental validation, which limits the clinical use of these compounds in the treatment of ALI. The role of various targeted small molecule inhibitors in ALI has also been validated, suggesting that it may become a potential new drug in the clinic. In recent years, ferroptosis as one of the PCD forms is a research hotspot and was shown to play an important role in several diseases. However, this article mainly summarizes the interaction of NLRP3 inflammasome with apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, as well as autophagy, in ALI (Figure 3) and does not involve iron death in ALI, whether NLRP3 inflammasome can interact with ferroptosis and thereby participate in the pathogenesis of ALI needs to be further clarified and studied.",1
"Conclusions
In this paper, a new rod single crystal {CoZn[(4,4′-BDA)(Phen)]2}n with 4,4′-H2BDA and Phen as ligands is synthesized and characterized. The crystal is a bimetal-organic complex with an entangled one-dimensional (1D) chain structure. Meanwhile, the micron-sized CoZn-MOF-B@C composites are prepared by hydrothermal method with the addition of CTAB and activated carbon and pH adjustment, which have a rectangular rod-shaped structure. The ZnO/CoO@C composites were formed by high-temperature pyrolysis at 450 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere using CoZn-MOF-B@C material as a precursor, which exhibited excellent lithium storage properties. At the current density of 0.2 A g−1, the initial discharge capacity is 1437.9 mAh g−1, and after 100 cycles, exhibiting a high reversible specific capacity of 741.8 mAh g−1 and good rate capability. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results further confirmed that the ZnO/CoO@C sample can form a more stable interface with the electrolyte, which endows it with a better electrochemical performance.",1
"In conclusion, during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 in Shanghai, primary HCWs experienced a deterioration in various sleep parameters, with self-reported ‘sleep quality’ and ‘daytime sleepiness’ being the most strongly affected domains. Self-reported depression, weekly burnout symptoms, and high psychological stress were associated with poor sleep health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, high stress was associated with higher odds of poor sleep health among the HCWs during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",1
"In this work, we found that the expression of lncRNA NORAD and PEAK1 is upregulated, whereas miR-363-3p is down-regulated in NSCLC. There is a direct targeting relationship between lncRNA NORAD and miR-363-3p as well as between miR-363-3p and PEAK1. We demonstrated that lncRNA NORAD acts as a sponge for miR-363-3p and affects the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by upregulating the expression of PEAK1, thereby promoting the development of NSCLC.",1
"Conclusions
In our large, prospectively collected cohort of patients undergoing hypospadias surgery, we were able to quantitate the change in GW measurements in response to preoperative T. The significant increase in glans size at the time of surgery, in response to preoperative administration of T, could aid surgeons by providing a wider surgical field to work with. We identified a dose-dependent treatment relationship, displaying a more drastic and significant increase in GW with 2 doses of T vs 1 dose. Longer-term GW measurements showed that this increase in size is temporary, and patients who did not receive preoperative T would achieve similar GW within 6 months from surgery. Further studies looking at the effect of T on GW and surgical outcomes will be important determinants of its true impact and what its role should be in hypospadias surgery.",1
"In conclusion, the present case describes a 55-year-old female patient who suffered from primary osteosarcoma of the spinal canal. MRI, pathologic examination including immunohistochemistry, and en bloc excision were performed, and at 6-month follow-up, the patient had no evidence of recurrent disease or residual side effects from therapy. The performance of MRI and pathologic evaluation with immunohistochemistry is particularly important for the differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors. The follow-up time of the current patient is relatively short considering the high risk of recurrence and metastasis associated with misdiagnosed osteosarcoma of the spinal canal, and long-term follow-up is often recommended in such cases. As osteosarcoma of the spine has a poor prognosis, 20% of patients develop local recurrence after en bloc excision, compared to 60% patients who develop after intraregional excision.[16,17]",1
"5. Conclusions
The mechanical microenvironment derived from cyclic mechanical loading, as a biofabrication strategy for bone regenerative biomaterials, could have dual efficacy in modulating the inflammatory microenvironment and stimulating the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs seeded on 3D scaffolds by suppressing the expression of inflammatory biomarkers and enhancing the expression of osteogenic biomarkers. The ECM-based scaffolds that were biofabricated with mechanical loading before freeze-drying facilitated the M2 polarization of macrophages in vitro and new bone formation in vivo, which verified the low inflammatory response and regenerative capability of the scaffolds.",1

"5 CONCLUSION
Together, these data demonstrate that chronic stress is associated with LCN2 upregulation, whereas engeletin treatment is capable of mitigating inflammation-associated damage and promoting the M2 polarization of M1 microglia through the suppression of LCN2/CXCL10 signalling activity. Of course, future studies need to further confirm the microglia polarization process by various means, such as flow cytometry for microglia sorting. In addition, cellular experiments are still needed here to complement the refinement of the molecular mechanism by which engeletin regulates microglia polarization.",1
Identification of therapeutic targets that act synergistically has the potential to improve survival and quality of life in patients with malignant tumors. Our data indicate that cotargeting resistin and fascin-1 is a useful therapeutic strategy in CRC. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that explain how resistin regulates fascin-1 expression in CRC.,1

"Conclusions
Physical therapy rehabilitation has been shown to enhance patients' activities of daily living. Brunnstrom's
approach was used for improving strength and the functional ambulation classification scale was used for
ambulation. Patients benefit from a quicker recovery because of it. In this instance, the patient was able to
carry out functional tasks on their own without concern for falling after the rehabilitation.",1
"5. Conclusion
In summary, an electrospun fiber scaffold system with tunable surface roughness mimicking ECM structure was produced. Increasing fiber SR led to increased protein adsorption and, subsequently, changes in the polarization of macrophages which were incubated on these materials. Increasing the SR led to a decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are known to play a role in the degeneration of fibrous connective tissues and to increase the M2:M1 ratio, which is known to improve healing. Overall, tuning the SR of electrospun fibers shows promise as a tool to increase the regenerative potential of fibrous biomaterials used to improve healing after fibrous connective tissue injuries.

"In conclusion, we investigated the expression of a wide panel of 798 miRNAs in patients with TED and identified 10 miRNAs which were differentially expressed between active and inactive TED. Validation studies revealed that the serum levels of miR-484 and miR-192-5p were significantly lower in active TED than in inactive TED. These miRNAs have the potential to serve as serum biomarkers of disease activity in TED. However, studies with larger sample sizes are needed to verify the roles of these miRNAs in the pathogenesis of TED.",1
"In conclusion, we found that GDF11 was involved in the imbalance of pulmonary vascular homeostasis in PAH by controlling abnormalities in endothelial dysfunction and angiogenesis. More importantly, we identified a novel molecular mechanism associated with GDF11 deregulation in PAH (ie, the ZNF740/GDF11/TGF-βRI/Smad axis). Therefore, these findings have significant implications in our understanding of PAH and provide insights into potential therapeutic approaches involving GDF11 signaling associated with PAH.",1
"4. Conclusion
Echocardiography is the single and readily available tool
that can be used in the diagnosis and management of
shock, particularly in differentiating the etiology and differentiation of shock. Echocardiography is a noninvasive modality that can be performed at the bedside anytime at per
convenience of the CCU physician and an initial RACE study
can lead to the commencement of treatment, with
a subsequent comprehensive study at a later time to add
vital information or monitor treatment. As echocardiography
is increasingly being used in an intensive care setting, its
applications and evidence base should be expanded by
randomized controlled trials to demonstrate patient outcomes in critical care.",1
"In conclusion, collectively, our present findings elucidate that BMSCs-secreted exosomal SNHG7 functions as a negative regulator in IL-1β-triggered chondrocyte inflammation and ferroptosis via miR-485-5p/FSP1 axis. This study suggests that exosomal SNHG7 has potential as a novel approach for OA treatment. Additionally, there are some limitations in our present research. This study only explored the function of exosomal SNHG7 in a cell model of OA in vitro. In vivo roles of exosomal SNHG7 in OA would be further validated in future work. Besides, further studies are needed to confirm whether there are other regulatory mechanisms between exosomal SNHG7 and FSP1 in modulating chondrocytes ferroptosis or inflammation. The biological function of exosomal SNHG7 on regulating synoviocytes is also warranted.",1
"Conclusion
In summary, LINC00460 is highly expressed in GC tissues and cell lines and exerts an oncogenic role through sponging miR-342-3p in GC. This study provides new insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying GC tumorigenesis and progression. Thus, our data indicate that LINC00460 may be used as a novel therapeutic target for GC.",1
"CONCLUSIONS
In this research, it has been tried to design and construct a blade for utilizing in soil tillage implements
such as the ditcher machine and bulldozer using the simulation of geometric shape of Armadillidium vulgare
surface body (corrugated blade). The drag force of this blade was compared with the flat and combined
blades. Results showed that the corrugated blade had better performance in wet soil and its drag force was
lower than two other blades’ drag force. The energy consumption of the corrugated blade at the travel speed
of 0.02 and 0.04 m/s in wet soil was 66% and 83% lower than the flat blade, respectively. This simulated
blade with such desirable characteristics can be used in agricultural machines and construction equipment,
which can result in a decrease in drag force and energy consumption. ",1
"Conclusions
It is concluded that OSR3 was the best PGPR strain to control S. rolfsii both in vitro and in vivo and to increase crop growth of chili. Disease management by bacterial antagonists might be associated with induction of resistance in plant through enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes. A. arvensis was not suitable to be used for control of collar rot disease of chili as it exerted negative impact on crop growth through allelopathy.",1

"Conclusões
A conclusão da investigação sobre a gestão da cadeia de abastecimento pré-hospitalar,
focada na fase de preparação e no contexto das máscaras, revela uma série de conclusões
cruciais e interligadas. Os ensinamentos extraídos dos desafios vivenciados durante a
pandemia, proporcionam oportunidades de aprendizagem inestimáveis, e Portugal tem a
prerrogativa de aprimorar a sua prontidão e resposta a crises vindouras. Desta forma, o efetivo
benefício dessas lições requer a incorporação de medidas tangíveis, com vista a fortalecer a
capacidade de reação (Lin & Lanng, 2020). As informações relevantes destacadas são a
necessidade de planeamento estratégico, um elemento fulcral para a robustez da cadeia de
abastecimento, pois a ausência de uma planificação estratégica por parte das entidades
governamentais pode resultar em carências substanciais, abrangendo desde a insuficiência de
quantidades até a falta de níveis mínimos de stock, elementos que se revelam cruciais em
emergências (Lin & Lanng, 2020). Destaca-se ainda a pertinência da flexibilidade e resiliência
no seio da cadeia de abastecimento pré-hospitalar, pois deve ser dotada da flexibilidade
necessária para enfrentar variações na procura e lidar com situações inesperadas, mantendo-se
resiliente perante cenários mutáveis (Mckenzie, 2020).
Neste sentido, os fornecedores e produtores assumem contornos de inegável
importância, pelo facto da disponibilidade e acessibilidade a bens críticos, a exemplo das
máscaras, configura-se como um pilar determinante, assentando-se na cooperação internacional
(Sodhi et al., 2021). Contudo, o desenvolvimento de uma maior independência internacional
pode ser um dos caminhos para um maior controlo e transparência da CA, analisando-se como
um paradigma a ser seguido, viabilizando o que sustente um acesso maior a tais recursos (Paul
& Chowdhury, 2021). É possível verificar que, a nível nacional, existe uma enorme indefinição
relativamente à caracterização dos fornecedores e produtores, existindo uma necessidade de
predefinição dos mesmos, de modo que exista uma preparação prévia na sua inserção na CA,
com o objetivo de uma maior cooperação e coordenação (Belhadi et al., 2021).
No mesmo sentido, a REPC exige um plano mais detalhado, pois deve existir um
planeamento e uma inventariação a nível nacional; se não existir uma noção geral dos números
de bens existentes no país, não se percebe as reais necessidades do mesmo. Da mesma forma,
a falta de pormenorização relativamente aos fornecedores, o desconhecimento do local da
REPC, que pode ser essencial para perceber quais as necessidades que vai conseguir suprir, os
acordos com fornecedores para a renovação dos bens armazenados e os custos de manutenção 
61
da mesma, são alguns dos pontos pouco ou nada detalhados que se revestem de extrema
importância (Belhadi et al., 2021).
Da mesma forma, os governos e entidades envolvidas na gestão de emergências devem
alocar recursos financeiros adequados para garantir a compra, armazenamento e renovação
constante dos materiais e equipamentos necessários (Zhu et al., 2020). A disponibilidade de
financiamento também influencia a capacidade de resposta rápida e eficaz em situações de
crise, assegurando que os recursos estejam prontamente acessíveis quando necessários
(Scavarda et al., 2019). A dinâmica da digitalização e transformação, por sua vez, sobressai
como um fenómeno cujo impulso foi exacerbado pela pandemia (Oxford Business Group,
2020). A aceleração dos processos de automação, a simplificação documental e a
implementação de modelos inteligentes surgem como vertentes capitais para a otimização da
logística, tais como as tecnologias disruptivas, como o EWS, apresentam-se como recursos
fulcrais (Oxford Business Group, 2020). A sua aplicação pode alavancar a gestão da cadeia de
abastecimento, incrementando a eficácia na gestão das informações e contribuindo para mitigar
potenciais disrupções futuras (Zhu et al., 2020).
Globalmente, estas conclusões enfatizam de forma inequívoca a relevância intrínseca
de uma gestão eficaz da cadeia de abastecimento pré-hospitalar, sobressaindo ainda os desafios
que a pandemia expôs, as respostas que foram desenhadas e as aprendizagens colhidas. Nesse
contexto, urge a necessidade de uma abordagem nacional e global e cooperativa, destinada a
alicerçar a resiliência da cadeia de abastecimento face a quadros complexos e em mutação
constante. Para além disso, segundo Shih (2020), é possível verificar uma grave falta de
aprendizagem organizacional significativa e conhecimento na gestão das cadeias de
abastecimento durante emergências anteriores, certamente contribuindo na falta de preparação
dos governos para sobreviver à pandemia da COVID-19 (Shih, 2020).",1
"As a consequence, circ_USP36 was up-regulated in atherosclerosis. As the first discovery, knockdown of circ_USP36 sponged miR-182-5p to reduce KLF5 expression, thereby attenuating ox-LDL-induced injury of HUVSMCs, including the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as the enhanced impact on cell apoptosis. Therefore, circ_USP36 might be a potential molecular therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.",1
"We conclude that exosomes in bovine milk alter microbial communities in nonbovine species, suggesting that exosomes and their cargos participate in the crosstalk between bacterial and animal kingdoms.",1
"5. Conclusions
The key findings of this study indicate that sFRP4 is a powerful apoptotic inducer that could act via p53-FASLG axis, and the apoptotic cascade can be fuelled through calcium-based apoptosis acting either through the Wnt calcium pathway or in conjunction with an unknown pathway in which calcium is a key player. Interestingly, the induction of pluripotentiality by sFRP4 knockdown suggests that this antagonist could on its own suppress a highly pluripotent state of stemness.",1
"In conclusion, miR-26a-5p was downregulated in the USM tissues of pregnant women with PTB. Additionally, miR-26a-5p lowered intracellular Ca2+ levels, and inhibited the CPI17/PKC/PLCγ pathway, and inactivated the calcium channels in LPS-exposed USM cells by targeting TRPC3. This study suggests that the miR-26a-5p/TRPC3 axis may be a promising therapeutic target for PTB treatment.",1
"Conclusions
Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency may increase the risk of developing COVID-19 infection and susceptibility to more severe disease. Its association with mortality is less robust. The data arise from a heterogeneous group of studies with substantial risk of bias; hence, the reduced certainty of evidence and need for cautious interpretation. RCTs investigating the therapeutic role of vitamin D were largely heterogeneous in design, precluding a meta-analysis.",1
"Conclusion
A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant therapeutic effects of probiotics on depression. It revealed probiotics can be a good choice if used to relieve depression. However, the probiotic intervention was not significantly effective in patients under age 40 with depression; therefore, more research adjusting for confounding factors is needed to confirm this result. Overall, probiotics may be used for early intervention or to prevent depression.",1
"Conclusions
In this cohort study, infants exposed to antenatal MgSO4 showed potentially enhanced brain connectivity reflected in stronger voxelwise functional connectivity, segregation, and integration on fMRI at term-equivalent age. These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which administration of antenatal MgSO4 when birth is imminent at a gestational age of 30 to 34 weeks may be neuroprotective for the preterm infant brain. Future studies exploring the association between these MRI findings and neurodevelopmental outcomes will assist with their interpretation.",1
"Conclusion
Moving beyond previous evidence of an association between IWB and emotional eating in bariatric surgery patients, our findings in individuals seeking bariatric surgery suggest that this association may be partially facilitated through internalized shame and interrupted through greater self-compassion. Furthermore, these associations persist after controlling for the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACE), a common contributor to poor eating behaviors, as well as depressive symptoms in a subset of participants. Given implications of emotional eating for post-operative grazing, surgical complications secondary to dietary non-compliance, and weight regain, continued research utilizing longitudinal designs is warranted to better understand the role of IWB, internalized shame, and self-compassion in relation to these sequelae.

While our findings implicate self-compassion as a protective factor and/or intervention target that may disrupt the effects of IWB and shame, research is needed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of self-compassion-based training programs in this population. Additionally, given the strong direct effect of IWB on emotional eating in our sample of bariatric surgery-seeking patients after accounting for shame and self-compassion, continued research on other potential risk/protective factors remains an important focus. Moreover, individually focused interventions need to be accompanied by structural- and interpersonal-level efforts to reduce weight-based prejudice towards persons with overweight and obesity, the source of IWB, and related sequelae.",1
"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we identified a novel lncGSAR that acts as a sponge for MiR-125b to activate the SCAP/SREBP pathway, resulting in promoting granulose cell proliferation and steroidogenesis. Therefore, this study identified a candidate lncRNA (lncGSAR) involved in ovine fecundity, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms by which glucose regulates follicular development and a basis for new strategies regulating animal reproduction by nutrients.",1
"5. Conclusions
We have substantiated that Toxoplasma infection is associated with an effect on various aspects of human cognitive performance, many of which are dependent on sex and Rh phenotype. Similarly, we have extended these findings to another pathogen, the human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Given the high prevalence of latent toxoplasmosis (about 33% worldwide) and CMV infection (likely over 80% in adult populations), the observed association, such as a decrease of 2.3 IQ points in Toxoplasma-infected individuals compared to uninfected ones (with a Cohen’s d of 0.213, categorized as a small magnitude), could have significant implications for the quality of life of a large number of people. These differences, observed as a decrease in IQ among infected individuals, may not only have implications for those who are directly affected but could also indirectly influence the broader uninfected population through societal and communal interactions.
Currently, there are no available treatments for latent toxoplasmosis or CMV infection. However, the development of vaccines against these infections could offer a preventative solution. Specifically in terms of toxoplasmosis control, vaccinating both pet and feral cats with oral vaccines could be a pivotal strategy in eradicating the disease. Our study highlights the importance of continued research into pathogens that may seem harmless but that could have significant impacts on human health and well-being.",1
"5. Conclusions
Our research results demonstrate for the first time that echinacoside is a promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent for the treatment of ALI. Echinacoside exerts its effects through the SIRT1-mediated inhibition of ROS-mediated endothelial cell activation and injury in the NOX4-Nrf2 axis. Mechanistically, activated SIRT1 competitively binds to p22 phox, reducing the interaction between NOX4 and p22 phox, thereby inhibiting NOX4 activity and promoting NOX4 ubiquitination degradation. Additionally, echinacoside deacetylates Nrf2, enhancing the NOX4-Nrf2 axis. Lastly, it is important to note that while the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of echinacoside on ALI have been explored in this study, the significance levels used may not have adequately addressed the issue of multiple testing involving various indicators and outcomes within the study. This limitation could potentially lead to an overestimation of statistical significance. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of echinacoside warrant further investigation in other inflammation-related diseases and conditions associated with endothelial cell activation and injury.",1
"While this study was designed to focus on the highly vulnerable population of patients that has recently initiated dialysis, its results must be interpreted within a certain context. Treatment of anemia can vary based on country and local practice patterns, and investigators were asked to follow the country-specific regulatory document for epoetin alfa (e.g. package insert). Therefore, point estimates for treatment differences may vary globally due to differences in epoetin alfa usage. Treatment of anemia using roxadustat was protocolized. As with all studies, the potential for volunteer bias (i.e. the Hawthorne effect) should be noted as it relates to the generalizability in clinical practice.

This Phase 3 trial in patients with ID-CKD showed that roxadustat was efficacious for correcting and maintaining Hb levels versus epoetin alfa with an acceptable safety profile.",1
"In conclusion, our study provides evidence that NBP induces ubiquitination and degradation of the HIF-1α transcription factor and influences mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activation, resulting in anti-apoptotic effects and inhibition of ROS-mediated damage. However, how NBP as a small molecule is involved in influencing HIF-1α ubiquitination requires further study. Further studies with more cell types as well as animal experiments may provide further insights. Our study paves the way for further studies on the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of NBP.",1
"In summary, We discovered a novel pathogenesis that KRT1 could maintain the intestinal barrier by upregulating TJ proteins expression, which maybe a potential therapeutic target of UC. Of course, more research is needed to verify.",1
"5. Conclusions
To sum up, this study provided evidence that lncRNA HCP5 could promote OC progression
through sponging miR-525-5p and up-regulating PRC1 expression and the following Wnt/β-catenin
activation (Fig. 8). Silencing of lncRNA HCP5 could inhibit proliferation, invasion, migration as
well as EMT of OC cells. This finding preliminarily evidenced that HCP5 can potentially serve as a
diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic option in the clinical practice for OC treatment. However,
the miRNA-525-5p expression profile in OC tissues or cells has not been concerned. Due to the
funding constraints, we would like to further perform follow-up studies on OC patients to
investigate the diagnostic and prognostic values of HCP5 and miR-525-5p. In addition, the
correlations between HCP5 and PRC1 or Wnt/β-catenin have been noticed, though, their specific 
18
roles and involvements in HCP5-mediated events are not concerned yet. We would like to perform
rescue experiments to address these issues.",1
"Briefly, we conclude that HIF1α and HIF2α regulate each other via negative feedback in GBM (Fig. 6F), which is the reason why targeting each one separately cannot ameliorate GBM patient prognosis. In addition, both HIF1α and HIF2α contribute to stemness expression and G1 phase arrest through Sox2 and Klf4, thus promoting GBM therapy resistance and a low proliferation rate (Fig. 6F). However, HIF1α- and HIF2α-KO cells induce the progression of the cell cycle into G2/M + S phase, thus promoting GBM growth while decreasing stemness, resulting in increased sensitivity of GBM cells to chemotherapy. Finally, HIF1α and HIF2α regulate the malignant progression of GBM through the EGFR–PI3K/AKT pathway with positive feedback (Fig. 6F), which provides a new tumour development model and a new strategy for treating GBM.",1
"In brief, lncRNA FTX and UBE2C are significantly upregulated in RCC specimens. Through the miRNA sponge effect on miR-4429 to upregulate UBE2C, lncRNA FTX markedly promoted the proliferation, viability, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion of RCC cells, thus aggravating the malignant progression of RCC. The findings indicated that lncRNA FTX and UBE2C are promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for RCC.",1
"5. Conclusions
This first genome-wide DNA methylation study of skin fibroblasts from SSc patients of African ancestry identified novel differentially methylated sites and genes. These include sites with evidence of altered methylation in protein-coding, lncRNA, and pseudogenes and concomitant differential expression in MGC12916, DLX5, and TMEM140. Although this cross-sectional study cannot separate causality from response to disease, it identifies DNA methylation alterations in genes and pathways that are important in SSc, showing that distinct DNA methylation changes underlie SSc in African Americans. These findings provide a foundation for further research to determine the functional consequences of the differentially methylated loci. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic marks, these loci might represent attractive targets for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune- and/or fibrotic-related diseases.",1
"In Summary, we identified circTLK1 overexpression in I/R mouse model, and revealed the
regulatory mechanism of circTLK1 in myocardial IRI injury. We reported for the first time
circTLK1 is critical in modulating myocardial IRI injury, and the functioning axis is via
targeting miR-214 to mediate RIPK1 and TNF signaling. Knockdown of circTLK1 demonstrated
substantial protective effects on cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue. Our study provided a novel
biomarker and potential therapeutic target for myocardial IRI injury. ",1
"5. Conclusions
The clinical efficacy of the proton beam therapy and plaque-based brachytherapy using COMS and CGD
plaques in the treatment of the intraocular tumors were practically measured and compared through the
Gafchromic film dosimetry approach in terms of the received dose by the tumor volume as well as the
surrounding healthy tissues.
Our findings demonstrate that the proton beam irradiation can result in a more uniform dose distribution
inside the target volume, a fact that can lead to an improved tumor control probability (TCP) during the
treatment. Furthermore, the intraocular proton therapy can better spare the laterally distributed OARs with
respect to both
125
I and
106Ru plaque-based brachytherapy techniques. Comparing the obtained DVH
data for COMS and CGD plaque also demonstrates that the COMS plaques generally show a better
performance regarding the dose uniformity inside the target volume as well as the received dose by the
Page 12/24
surrounding healthy tissues. Nevertheless, the eye lens, optic nerve, optic disc, and macula are better
saved when the CGD plaque is employed for brachytherapy. Therefore, based on the importance of the
OAR which should be spared, the COMS or CGD plaque can be selected for radiotherapy.
From the results, it can be finally concluded that using the proton beam would be preferred to the photon
and electron beam for eyeball irradiation, provided that the radiotherapy department is equipped with
hadron therapy technology. Otherwise, using the photon beam can lead to superior clinical efficacy
concerning the electron beam in the radiotherapy of intraocular tumors.",1
"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, DEB-TACE is effective in primary liver cancer and secondary liver cancer, and the complications were tolerable. No factors were correlated with the response to DEB-TACE. DEB-TACE with other therapeutic tools should be explored to get a higher response rate and more prolonged survival.",1
"Conclusion
The comparison between L-RYGB and R-RYGB after the learning curve presented similar results in terms of 30-day and 12-month follow-up outcomes for patients with similar preoperative characteristics when an equal number of procedures was performed in each group. The operative time was higher in R-RYGB (which was an expected finding); on the other hand, L-RYGB was the unique risk factor independently associated with a LOS longer than 2 days. Large multicenter randomized trials are necessary to confirm these findings prospectively.",1
"In conclusion, synovium and serum DUSP22 are intercorrelated and insufficiently expressed in RA patients; meanwhile, their deficiency correlates with increased systemic inflammation, disease activity, and joint dysfunction in RA patients. These findings indicate that the measurement of DUSP22 (blood or synovium) may assist RA diagnosis and activity monitor, while further large sample-sized study is needed to further validate its value.",1
"Conclusions
This well characterized PSCI model is a close mimic of the clinical setting and accurately encompasses pathophysiological aspects of the syndrome. It will provide a realistic setting to develop a specific QUIN inhibitor as proposed in one preclinical work [46]. There are currently no therapeutic options to cure or prevent PSCI. Limiting the size of the triggering stroke is not sufficient [9]. Large prospective clinical studies are now needed to confirm our preliminary data in stroke patients, which show that serum QUIN concentrations and QUIN/KYNA ratios are reliable biomarkers to predict PSCI and ask whether these indices are predictive biomarkers of a higher risk or severity of the syndrome. Clinical work to provide a useful biomarker will most importantly need to define an accurate cut-off value beyond which the serum biomarker is reliably correlated with PSCI development.",1
"V. CONCLUSIONS
The current work extends the scope of NE-RPMD to the study of state-resolved reactive scattering dynamics for reactions involving more than three atoms. We have compared the ICS results for the reactions H + CH4, H + CHD3, and F + CHD3 with and without vibrational C–H stretch excitation in CHD3. Good agreement for the H + CH4/CHD3/CD4 ground state reactions was found. We show that the NE-RPMD simulations describe the dominant ZPE effects present in the dynamics for a wide range of collision energies. However, we also see that NE-RPMD only performs marginally better than QCT for the reaction F + CHD3, where relevant tunneling effects cannot be described with NE-RPMD.

For vibrationally excited states, we find that the NE-RPMD method can also give accurate ICSs that are similar to those obtained from much more involved RDQD simulations. The centroid stretch excitation scheme employed to excite the C–H stretch vibrational mode in CHD3 was found to be robust and fairly accurate for the time period of most of the simulations (if ≤ 200 fs). When employed to study the C–H excited H + CHD3 reaction, good agreement with the RDQD ICS is found. In summary, except for the reactive collision F + CHD3, where tunneling effects are dominant, NE-RPMD simulations show good agreement with RDQD simulations, especially for collision energies around the threshold. In contrast to the ground state calculations, for the vibrational excited states, the ICSs calculated with the NE-RPMD method show no significant improvement over those calculated with QCT for the here considered reactions. For the discrepancies that arise at larger collision energy, one has to keep in mind that the dimensional reduction on which RDQD results rely may not be strictly valid anymore. We can conclude that the NE-RPMD method is able to overcome key limitations of the previously applied QCT methodologies at the cost of extra computational efforts, which remain small in comparison to quantum scattering methodologies. NE-RPMD can be relatively easily built in into existing MD codes and can be applied to considerably larger systems, thanks to its scalability. However, the current NE-RPMD method employs an inconsistent and unclear choice for the β parameter. As such, our NE-RPMD approach as it stands and the present choice of β can be seen as a possible starting point for further refinements of the methods toward broader and consistent applications of NE-RPMD for state-selective reactive scattering simulations.",1
"In conclusion, the molecular mechanism of S. aureus infecting dairy cow mammary epithelial cells involves the paracrine mode of exosomal cargo lncRNA playing a regulatory role in pathogen invasion and adhesion, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The data obtained in this study would also provide valuable resources for understanding the lncRNA information in exosomes derived from dairy cow mammary epithelial cells, and conduced to the study of S. aureus infection in dairy cow mammary glands.",1
"5 Conclusions
In a modern scientific community in which “publish or perish” is still mandatory and h-index is considered a sound metric to value scholars, quantity is frequently prioritized over quality. Although peer-reviewers usually defend the scientific community's integrity, the publication process is not perfect and it can miss its target, as reported here about the COVID-19 pandemic. Open access and fast track paths to publication are useful tools but might represent a menace if left unchecked since the former can be an incentive to accept manuscripts, and the latter can lead to lower quality threshold and reduced attention by peer-reviewers.

It is reasonable to assume the retracted articles found in this review are just the tip of an iceberg of dubious-value publications pre- and during the pandemic. During times of great stress, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this should be considered a menace for the integrity of modern science as well as for the well-being of the global community since unchecked facts and fake evidence are the ground on which fake news thrive.",1

"In terms of understanding the functional outcomes of GWAS
SNPs, it is now clear that they must be examined in the correct cell
type and context. Because of the limitations of acquiring human microglia in sufficient quantity from large numbers of human subjects
(as is needed for genetic association studies) and a lack of a cell line
that adequately mimics human microglia, we suggest that the MDMi
cell model system could overcome this challenge. In addition to genetic studies, MDMi cells may be useful in drug screening where
biochemical or functional changes in response to drugs could be
monitored when microglia are thought to be the target cell type.
Additional potential applications of MDMi cells may include the
exploration of various biological behaviors of human microglia in
neurodegenerative disorders. Coculturing MDMi cells with human
neurons and astrocytes would enable the modeling of innate immune dysfunction in a more complex system where the target cell is
interacting with other relevant cell types. Finally, given that the differentiation protocol takes just 10 days, one could envisage that in the
future, MDMi cells derived from a patient’s monocytes could be rapidly characterized to help with drug selection and disease management (71). In conclusion, we propose that our in vitro translational

"The present experiments have limitations. In the behavioral pharmacology studies, we
acknowledge there is no vehicle injection group. As we were exploring subtle differences in stress
behavior, we employed a non-injected, baseline behavioral strategy instead. Concerns for norBNI
not being on board during stress testing are mitigated by the fact that systemic norBNI lasts for
months post-injection (Potter et al. 2011).Another consideration worth discussing is the repeated
stress tests. It is plausible that the repeated forced swim tests affected the TMT behavioral tests",1
"4. Conclusion
In summary, an effective method to graft cross-linked
temperature-responsive hydrogel, i.e. P (NIPAAm-co-BMA-co-MBA)
onto fused silica fibers as an SPME coating was developed
by surface-initiated ATRP reaction. The SF-P(NIPAAm-co-BMA-coMBA) exhibited temperature-responsive extraction performance,
i.e., more polar analytes were extracted below LCST of P(NIPAAmco-BMA-co-MBA) and more non-polar analytes were extracted
above its LCST. This approach holds great promise for SPME
because it paves the way for the preparation of temperatureresponsive polymers in a rich library that can provide SPME with
diverse coatings with desired properties.",1
"In conclusion, the present study highlights the significance of continued genomic surveillance for antimicrobial resistance of livestock associated Enterococcus spp., which continue to pose a serious global threat to human health and food security, primarily a leading cause of foodborne illnesses and invasive infections in humans. The study highlights the importance of food animals as principal reservoirs of multidrug resistant pathogenic Enterococcus spp. The use of subtherapeutic doses of antimicrobial agents in animal feeds for prophylactic and growth-promoting purposes are among the major causes of the multiple drug resistance observed in the isolates reproted in the present study. The shedding of multiple drug-resistant, animal-associated Enterococcus in the environment through faecal contamination is a serious concern. Enterococcus spp. and important food pathogens of zoonotic potential and public health risks should be regularly surveyed and monitored in livestock production systems.",1

To my knowledge, this is the first study that (a) shows a positive associative relatedness effect in percent serial recall when a short study-list length (six items) was used in an immediate serial recall paradigm; (b) shows negative semantic relatedness effects in order retention for both associative and category lists; (c) fits the MPT model to yield the parameters that directly reflect the role of item redintegration in the semantic relatedness effect; and (d) demonstrates the effects of inter-item and theme-item associative strength on percent serial recall in regression analyses. These findings should be further verified by orthogonally manipulating list type (associative vs category), inter-item associative strength, and theme–item associative strength in future research so as to tease apart the influence of these three semantic variables on serial recall. The present findings at least clearly showed that an associative-based mechanism (e.g., Stuart & Hulme, Citation2000) should be postulated and incorporated with Hulme et al.'s (Citation1997) item redintegration theory in order to account for the effect of semantic relatedness on immediate serial recall. More recently, Stuart and Hulme (Citation2008) proposed a redintegration model in which the recall performance is determined by a network of mutually supporting connections among items that were presented together on prior occasions. Future research on serial recall should test this model to determine if it could account for the semantic relatedness effect that is mediated more by inter-item associative strength than by theme–item associative strength.",1

The lessons learned from social psychological research into
situated cognition (Smith & Semin, 2004, 2007) can provide
a heuristically useful framework for understanding embodiment effects. While a book’s heft would not affect its perceived

physical weight, its heft alone is not sufficient to make it
important. Sometimes a heavy book is just a heavy book.",1
"In summary, KRT7-AS reduces cancer cell tumorigenesis, inhibits tumor growth, and enhances cancer cell apoptosis mainly through decreasing oncogenic KRT7 expression and increasing tumor-suppressive PTEN protein levels in cancer cells. KRT7-AS functions as a new tumor suppressor and apoptotic enhancer in lung and breast cancers. There is a novel tumor suppressive RXRα-KRT7-AS-PTEN signaling axis in cancer cells. Therefore, upregulation of KRT7-AS expression and activation of the RXRα-KRT7-AS-PTEN signaling axis are novel strategy for cancer therapy (Graphic summary).",1
"6. Conclusion
Most of the presented methods for PD prediction depend strongly on human proficiency [96]. The benefits of deploying the ML in the medical sector are that they provide objective, context-independent, and data-driven analysis [97]. ML approaches have been utilized effectively in disease diagnosis and severity prediction [27,42,54,61,77–79,98–100]. Particularly, ML has also been utilized in analyzing the data collected from wearable IMU sensors for automated evaluation of motor disorders like PD [101–103]. Hence, the practical aim of this study entails providing supplementary, quick, and accurate methods that can aid experts in reaching more objective medical decisions considering the PD diagnosis. By deploying these methods in the appropriate systems, several gains can be acquired that entail reducing the expenses of manual diagnosis and minimizing diagnosis time.

Continuing this line of research and supporting previous literature, this study uses both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to diagnose PD through UPDRS prediction. Besides, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and prediction learning techniques are used to create the PD diagnosis method. The basic aim of this paper is to conduct comparative research of the ML approaches for PD diagnosis. We concentrated on clustering and prediction learning methods to conduct the comparative study. Particularly, several clustering approaches for PD data segmentation and SVR ensembles to predict Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS were used. The findings are then evaluated based on other prediction learning methods, MLR, neurofuzzy, and SVR techniques based on a real-world PD dataset. The finding of the study indicated the superiority of deploying EM with SVR ensembles in relation to decision trees, neurofuzzy and SVR combined with other clustering approaches in the prediction of Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS.

Many previous works have been conducted focusing on patients’ classifications, severity prediction, and remote monitoring. Still, there are future routes in each field to be investigated. Besides, several sensors such as magnetometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope have been utilized and assessed. Additionally, MRI, EEG signals, f-MRI, and DATSCAN images were utilized to present accurate predictions of the disease. Other research directions can be followed by utilizing other brain signal images such as ECG, EMG, and PCG. Other sensing modalities can be explored and combined to present a more accurate classification of the disease.

Even though ML methods in previous literature have presented high classification accuracy for PD detection, still, there are some obstacles related to feature extraction and selection which need to be addressed [104]. The utilization of several features can increase the computation time [105,106]. On the other hand, if fewer features were utilized, this will increase the complexity of extracting the features, which will accordingly impact the computation time. This paper has some shortcomings which should be considered in future research. The study is based on a real-world dataset to assess the proposed approaches, which has one limitation considering the number of features used in the prediction process. Other PD datasets with a larger number of features can be utilized in the evaluation of the deployed approaches. Large datasets can present more generalized outcomes. Emerging technologies can be used to collect data from patients using particular applications, as suggested by Bot et al. [107], in which the authors developed an application to collect the data from PD patients using their iPhones. This approach can ease the data collection from the public because of the availability of smartphones and help to present more generalizable outcomes. Furthermore, this study can be extended by incremental machine learning approaches to improve the computation time of previous PD diagnosis methods in processing large datasets [44,89].",1
"Conclusions
In summary, TyG index, METS-IR and TyG-BMI index were independently associated with AF recurrence following ablation. Non-insulin-based IR indexes may be useful for recurrence risk stratification for AF ablation. Comparison of the four non-insulin-based IR indexes showed that the TyG-BMI index had the highest predictive value for AF recurrence, followed by METS-IR. Co-presence of DM or long duration of AF and high TyG-BMI index or METS-IR portends a dismal prognosis. Our findings support the utility of non-insulin-based IR indexes as a reliable indicator for AF recurrence risk stratification in the real world. More studies are necessary to investigate if interventions that aim to address IR, as evaluated by non-insulin-based IR indexes, can improve the clinical outcomes for patients with AF ablation.",1
"Regrettably, our study is currently more focused on validating our conclusions in detail in HCM cells, lacking relevant data from animal studies. Therefore, in vivo studies will be the focus of our research in the follow-up studies. Nevertheless, we also confirmed for the first time that METTL3 regulates MI through m6A modified lncRNA-SNHG8, and proved that lncRNA-SNHG8 can bind to PTBP1 to regulate ALAS2, thereby enhancing oxidative stress and promoting cardiomyocyte injury. This provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of myocardial infarction in the future.",1
"Conclusion
As our study demonstrates that PTSD patients vary in terms of their treatment preferences, information and preference assessments may improve care for PTSD patients by allowing the provision of the optimal treatment for the individual, which might increase compliance and reduce dropout rates.

"CONCLUSIONS
Children who experience non-fatal firearm injury have increased number of healthcare
encounters and healthcare expenditures the year after firearm injury, which is not sustained for a
second year overall. Most of the study sample (low prior health expenditures subgroup) did,
however, have significantly increased inpatient utilization and overall expenditures in the second
year following a firearm injury. Mental health outpatient services remain decreased overall, most
so for those who had high mental health outpatient expenditures the year prior to the injury.
Individual-level research is needed to fully evaluate the longitudinal burden of non-fatal firearm
injury on children, and whether public health firearm injury prevention programs decrease
firearm injuries among children which could decrease healthcare utilization and expenditures. It
is imperative to recognize the importance of accurately describing findings on childhood firearm
injuries in the context of the limitations of the data being presented. The authors suspect an
underestimation of the amount of health utilization and expenditures for this population notably
in the second year due to the limitations of the database. To adequately inform longitudinal 
13
public policy on firearm injuries in children, more robust population, patient, and family level
data is needed. ",1
"In conclusion, the clinical significance of the results of this preliminary investigation into the effects of the IQOS device are hard to discern. Our innovative system indicated that IQOS was not toxic for oral fibroblasts and keratinocytes as it neither modified survival nor morphology. Since it did impact on proliferation and the cell cycle further studies are needed to identify which components of the IQOS aerosol are involved. Another limitation of this study was restricting IQOS exposure to 24 h which precluded long-term observations. So, it might be interesting to study a treatment repeated over time (chronic).

Even if the smoke system used in the study does not generate thermal alterations induced by the IQOS device, a further limitation of the study is represented by the need to evaluate the effects of the heating on the oral mucosa. Starting from these preliminary results our null hypotheses can be rejected.

"Conclusions
The genera Lactobacillus and Prevotella
were associated with objective treatment
responses, and after controlling for age, 1
predominant OTU (Prevotella) and
other less abundant OTUs were associated with surgical treatment nonresponses in women undergoing a
midurethral sling operation for MUI.
Further research is needed to corroborate the current findings and to further
explore potential clinical applications in
the setting of a surgical procedure for
pelvic floor disorders.
Take-Home Message
In women with MUI, urinary microbiota
were not associated with outcomes after
a midurethral sling operation. However,
vaginal microbiota at the time of the
surgery were associated with subjective
and objective treatment responses 1 year
later. Those with greater vaginal Prevotella, which was correlated with
decreased Lactobacillus, had less reduction of incontinence. Research is needed
to determine whether altering the
vaginal microbiome affects surgical
outcomes. n

"Finally, we conclude that children can cope with emotional distractors the same way as with neutral distractors. Therefore, a normal perceptual inhibition development, predicts a normal emotional interference control performance when the interference source is an external stimulus. This has a direct practical implication, because a failure in controlling the emotional interference could lead to anxiety (Bishop, Citation2009) and depression (Joormann & Gotlib, Citation2008). Moreover, in post-traumatic stress disorder, the patient’s life quality could be improved by inhibiting the recurrent emotional stimuli that enter their working memory (Hayes, LaBar, Petty, McCarthy, & Morey, Citation2009). Therefore, the next logical step based on our results should be the evaluation of the remaining inhibition functions of the multidimensional model, that is, cognitive and response inhibition, in both cold and hot contexts. A more profound knowledge of these inhibition functions could lead to better diagnosis and treatment in clinical population, and improve daily life quality.",1

Chronic opiate treatment for pain conditions in
young women appears to be an important cause of
persistent urinary retention as a sole factor or by
compounding the abnormality resulting from a primary disorder of sphincter relaxation. It is hypothesized that Fowler’s syndrome is due to an up-regulation of spinal cord enkephalins and that exogenous
opiates may compound any functional abnormalities

"Collectively, the experiments in this study provide new insights in understanding the pathogenesis of early features of DR, demonstrating that the accumulation of AGA within the diabetic retina elicits the microglial activation and secretion of TNF-α. In addition, our in vitro data disclose the molecular mechanisms involved therein, showing that AGA triggers TNF-α release from microglia in ROS and its subsequent ERK and P38 MAPKs-dependent mechanisms. Thus, clinical intervention trials with agents that neutralize glycated albumin effect might be warranted in modulating early pathologic pathways long before the occurrence of vision loss among patients with diabetes.",1
"CONCLUSION
As retraction is closely linked to the reproducibility crisis in scientific research, this study looks at specific cases of retraction to find notable patterns, as well as to draw important lessons for academia. We suggest that (1) improving the transparency and indexing of retraction notices in conjunction with (2) providing detailed explanations in these notices can help ease the stigma associated with retraction. This is particularly important in cases of ‘heroic acts’ – the authors who came forward to admit their errors deserve recognition for their commitment to protecting the quality of the scientific literature. Another aspect that deserves attention is the disappearing limitation section as most of the retracted papers in our database contain no limitation section or a very cosmetic one. Making the limitation section publicly available and setting a higher and stricter standard for it might be a reasonable way forward in reforming publishing practices to prevent bad science from entering the literature in the first place.

Yet, besides the practical lessons suggested above, it is also important to keep in mind the fact that no scientist is perfect, that honest errors do regrettably happen. In fact, only by continuously making mistakes can a scientist eventually arrive at a result (Ho, Nguyen, Vuong, Nguyen, & Ho, 2019). As such, self-correction, which includes retraction and correction, should be viewed in a more sympathetic light. The scientific enterprise, in its quest for truthful and better understanding of the world around us, demands every scientist to be on a high-alert against disinformation and misinformation as much as to be open-minded towards an accidental slip of the mind.

"Our conclusions are very similar to a previous Cochrane review on vitamin C for asthma (Kaur 2009). However, in Kaur 2009 the primary outcomes were lung function and symptom scores as opposed to exacerbations and health‐related quality of life in this review. Two additional studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified in this review (Nadi 2012; Schertling 1990). However, our conclusions are consistent with those drawn in the 2009 review where the authors argue that ""further methodologically strong and large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed in order to address the question of the effectiveness of vitamin C in asthma"". We hope that such research will be conducted and that particular emphasis will be given to the assessment of efficacy with respect to any impact on asthma exacerbations and health‐related quality of life.",1
"A. baumannii is an emerging human pathogen and utilizes QS to control at least a subset of
phenotypes linked to virulence, including surface motility and biofilm formation. Methods
to modulate QS in this bacterium with spatial and temporal control could provide valuable
new insight into the role of QS in the infection process, and to date are currently lacking in
the field. Herein, we have outlined the first study aimed at the identification of non-native
small molecules capable of intercepting a putative QS receptor in A. baumannii, AbaR.
There were several important outcomes of our work. First, the synthesis and testing of both
(S)-OH-dDHL and (R)-OH-dDHL as AbaR activators revealed the latter molecule to be the
most active diastereomer. We propose that, in view of the known AHL biosynthetic
pathways and the other structurally characterized 3’-OH AHL signals, (R)-OH-dDHL is
likely the native signal in A. baumannii. Second, using an A. baumannii AbaR reporter
strain, we systematically screened a library of synthetic AHLs and uncovered the first
known non-native AHLs capable of modulating AbaR activity. Both AbaR antagonists and
agonists were identified, and several antagonists were highly potent (for example, AHLs
C11 and 1, with IC50 values of 2.32 µM and 2.91 µM, respectively). Two AHLs (2 and D18)
were identified as moderate AbaR agonists, with EC50 values that were only five to 10-fold
greater than that of the native signal (R)-OH-dDHL (7.57 µM and 4.89 µM, respectively).
Third, careful structural analysis of these molecules revealed important SAR for AbaR
antagonism and agonism by non-native AHLs. Perhaps most strikingly, selected D-AHLs
were found to be strong antagonists of AbaR and in some cases were equal or stronger
antagonists than their L-AHL analogues. This result was unexpected, as D-AHLs are
typically far less active than their L-HL analogues in other LuxR-type receptors (e.g., TraR,
LasR, LuxR, and QscR) as either antagonists or agonists, and suggests that AbaR may
interact with these ligands in a different manner (16, 20, 22, 29). Maximal antagonism was
observed for AHLs with aliphatic acyl chains containing seven to eight carbons and a 3’-oxo",1
"4.3 Conclusions
Evidence suggests that NET is effective in treating trauma-related symptoms in adults, perpetrators of violence and in children and adolescents. Treatment benefits are maintained and may even improve over time. The narrative approach seems to facilitate the acceptance of NET within a variety of cultures and settings. Furthermore, the theoretical foundation of NET based on neurobiological memory processes provides opportunities to further adapt NET to address e.g., aggressive behavior (Elbert et al., Citation2010; Elbert et al., Citation2018). The fact that NET was designed to treat survivors of multiple and complex trauma histories, and has been evaluated in many perilous environments, points to a certain robustness of the approach, since factors inherent in such settings often hamper the impact of trauma-focused therapies (Gerger et al., Citation2014; Nosè et al., Citation2017). The majority of studies have been conducted with high external validity and a quality that is equivalent to other psychotherapy research. Hence, NET has to be considered a treatment approach of choice for post-conflict settings and refugee populations. Further research is needed within highly developed health care systems with non-refugee and populations not living in post-conflict settings. We would also encourage more research trials comparing NET with other evidence-based trauma focused treatments, and regarding children and adolescents in all settings.",1
"In conclusion, our results documented a variable association of ambulatory peripheral and central BP, arterial stiffness and wave reflections with HMOD. The predictive value was high in case of cardiac damage, whereas it was marginal in case of carotid damage and impaired renal function. These findings corroborate previous evidence collected with a different technology and suggest that 24-h PWA, and in particular 24-h central SBP and PP, may be useful for predicting the risk of HMOD in hypertensive patients, at least when cardiac damage is considered. As our study is currently the largest one evaluating the relation between ambulatory peripheral and central hemodynamics and stiffness and HMOD in hypertensive patients based on a specific technology, the evidence collected will help provide some reference to clinicians making use of the same device employed in this study, for the routine clinical evaluation of their patients. However, we acknowledge that prospective data are warranted to confirm the clinical value of the technology in this context. Such data will be collected in the longitudinal phase of the VASOTENS Registry.",1
"In summary, we found that higher iron stores were inversely associated with asthma and

iron status in asthma morbidity is also merited, given the findings in this study and the effect
of iron on mast cells and eosinophils, which are known to play key roles in the asthmatic response. Should iron insufficiency prove to increase the risk of asthma, it would afford an opportunity to reduce the risk of asthma using an inexpensive intervention in a substantial
number of individuals.",1

"Collectively, we demonstrate the value in assessing natural behaviors over a
continuum using physical, quantifiable measures. We identify physiologically relevant
signals from the peripheral nervous system that inform us of internal mental states. Our
work discovers a methodical approach to blindly and objectively separate changes in
visual perception by studying the unfolding of movement, stressing the importance of
treating behavior as a continuum of motions. We also uncover effects of speed
instructions on perceptual tasks, implicating that instructed speed maintenance may
require a high cognitive load that in turn dampens our responses to perceptual inputs in
order to execute motor tasks as instructed.
When we apply our statistical framework to a clinical population that exhibits a
number of cognitive abnormalities, we see a disorganization of sensory-motor processing
in the deliberate control of actions and in the automatic retractions of the arm, suggesting
that the presence of disorganized high-level mental processes is closely related to
kinesthetic sensing. By reestablishing the relationship between the brain and body, we
establish a transformative approach to research practices that can help advance our
understanding of basic scientific principles. Ultimately, we can translate these findings
into clinically relevant tools to better diagnose and treat patients suffering from brain
disorders. In fact, calling schizophrenia a disorder of the brain is in itself incomplete and
inaccurate, as we demonstrate that abnormalities exist throughout the body. Taken
together, we set out to redefine the way in which research is conducted in the

psychological and psychiatric sciences to better understand the underlying processes that
make up our natural behaviors through a new, objective, statistical lens.",1
"Conclusions

"Moreover, Lip-Fasudil was found to increase the therapeutic window of Fasudil. In our
pilot study, we found that 100 mg/kg Fasudil administrated i.v. caused the death of tumorbearing mice (data not shown). In contrast, Fasudil at doses lower than 30 mg/kg showed
only minor anti-tumor effects (data not shown). Similar results obtained by other groups
using Fasudil to treat lung cancer in mice have been reported [16]. These results demonstrate
the narrow therapeutic window of Fasudil, which might hinder its clinical application for
cancer treatment. However, since Lip-Fasudil reduced the distribution of Fasudil in other
normal tissues and hence reduced systemic toxicity, the administrative doses could be escalated when necessary in the clinics. To conclude, our study indicated that Fasudil is effective
in inhibiting HCC growth and that Lip-Fasudil can enhance its efficacy and reduce its toxicity. Therefore, liposomal Fasudil holds great potential for use for the treatment of liver
cancer.",1

"IV. CONCLUSIONS
We constructed a QNC protocol for network Gk, which is
independent from the CNC protocol. For k = 2, it degrades
to a protocol over the butterfly network. The independency of
our protocol is embodied in two respects:
• For all the network nodes, we simply perform the composition of reflection operator and control cyclic shift
operator R ◦ CSg or R ◦ CSg ◦ R on each node, rather
than constructing different coding operations that rely on
classical operation at different nodes.
• The transmission of classical information no longer relies
on the classical solution because no classical transmission
bottleneck exists in our decoding strategy.
This construction avoids classical transmission bottlenecks in
large-scale networks, which would benefit the architectures
of a Quantum network. Moreover, we attain the maxflow
transmission under the assumption of unit edge capacity as
discussed in above section, extending the achievable rate
region result over the butterfly network. Our protocol also
leads to a reduction in communication cost. We gave the
exact amount (k
2 + k − 1)⌈log d⌉ to calculate the classical
communication cost in this paper. For the same k, the amount
of quantum registers in our protocol is significantly reduced
by only introducing registers at half instead of all of the nodes
of the network [13], [14]",1

ChIP-exo and Antibodies
With the following modifications, ChIP-exo was carried out as previously described [35] with
chromatin extracted from 10 million cells, ProteinG MagSepharose resin (GE Healthcare), and
3 ug of either TFIIB (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-225), TBP (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-204), or Pol II
(Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-899, directed against the N-terminus of the Pol II large subunit
encoded by POL2RA).
Alignment to Genome, Peak Calling, and Data Access
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The entire length of the sequenced
tags were aligned to the human hg18 reference genome using BWA [36] using default parameters. Raw sequencing data are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA067908) and a
sequencing statistics summary may be found in Table C in S1 File. The resulting sequence read
distribution was used to identify peaks on the forward (W) and reverse (C) strand separately
using the peak calling algorithm in GeneTrack (sigma = 20, exclusion zone = 40 bp) [37]. For
strand-specific and strand-merged plots, sequencing tags were normalized to input. To obtain
RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) normalized counts, Input tags were
binned relative to TSSs in the same manner as ChIP data, RPKM computed, and then for each
corresponding bin the RPKM for each ChIP data set was divided through by the Input RPKM.
Peaks were paired if they were 0–80 bp in the 30 direction from each other and on opposite
strands. Any peak-pair locations that were present in the ENCODE designated blacklist were
removed from the analysis [38]. Since patterns described here were evident among individual
biological replicates, and replicates were well correlated, we merged all tags from biological replicate data sets to make final peak-pair calls. TFIIB peak pairs in K562 cells were initially considered for preliminary analysis if they had a low threshold tag count of >4 in the merged
datasets. 159,117 locations met these criteria. Subsequent analysis revealed that 8,364 TFIIB
locations were near (within 500bp) a RefSeq TSS, while the remaining 150,753 TFIIB locations
were TSS-distal (>500bp). Input tag distribution relative to 8,364 TFIIB locations is shown in
S2 Fig.
NCBI-curated RefSeq TSSs (n = 26,987) [16] comprising 23,562 nonredundant gene TSSs
genes were considered (Table D in S1 File). Assignment of TFIIB (8,364 peak-pairs) and TBP
(7,642 peak-pairs) to the nearest RefSeq TSS required that they be within 500 bp of the TSS,
yielding 6,511 nonredundant mRNA genes. Importantly, using a more stringent interval only
marginally changed these numbers and did not alter our conclusions. If a gene had >1 TSS,
then the TSS nearest to the bound location (peak-pair midpoint) was used as the primary TSS,
and other nearby TSSs were considered secondary (Fig 1C, lower panel).""",1
"4. Conclusions
The lignite insoluble residue (LIR) after extraction of humic acids was used as the catalyst support of Ni, and then Ni/LIR was prepared and
tested for steam reforming of toluene. Ni/LIR has several advantages over metal oxides, such as low cost, combined catalytic activity from
both the inherent mental species and char support, and reduced use of Ni in reforming.

Nickel particles were highly dispersed with satisfactory loading amount (23.58 wt%) in Ni/LIR by the combined ion exchange and
impregnation method. Ni/LIR has good textural characteristics and plays a significant role in toluene steam reforming, largely increasing
conversion ratio and product gas yields, compared with no catalyst, lignite insoluble residue and the conventional Ni/Al2O3 catalyst.
The experimental results show that under optimum conditions, more than 95% of toluene was converted to syngas by the catalysis of Ni/
LIR. The higher temperature is favorable for toluene conversion, but more char support was consumed by steam gasification. We suggested
catalytic temperature of 900 K and steam/carbon ratio of 2.75e3.5 mol/mol as the conditions for efficient toluene conversion and acceptable
char consumption. Nevertheless, further condition optimization, extended assessment of catalyst lifetime for long run applications, and
reforming of real biomass tar are necessary for the future.",1

"7 CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
So far, different approaches have been followed to reduce weight and reduce its complications. However, many of these ways have led to disappointing results. Therefore, researchers and physicians are looking for new, safe, complementary, and alternative treatment methods for this global concern. Herbal medicines are considered as an effective option for weight and body fat loss. The effectiveness and the relevant mechanisms through which herbal medicine work as an anti-obesity treatment are still controversial. The results of this systematic review demonstrate the effectiveness of herbal medicine for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. According to the results of the present study on controlled clinical trials, green tea, P. vulgaris, G. cambogia, N. sativa, puerh tea, I. gabonensis, and C. fimbriata were found to induce an acceptable anti-obesity effect and metabolic syndrome. However, there is still a need to determine a good anti-obesity drug candidate with more effect and less adverse effect. The results of this study indicate the specific doses of each medicinal herbs that could be effective. In addition, these data can be beneficial for the pharmaceutical industry and policy makers to study the natural products and extracts of these plants in order to find a mixture with higher efficacy. In the future, it is recommended to standardize herbal medicine intervention on obesity and metabolic syndrome. On the same basis, a plethora of research and well-designed clinical trials are needed to address these issues and to assess the adverse effects associated with herbal medicines and their mechanism of action.

"5 CONCLUSION
In summary, we presented dynamic trends of four skin barrier parameters from birth to 6 months of age, and provided evidence from the Chinese infants that higher TEWL values one month after birth was predictive to increased risk of developing early-onset AD. Our study added evidence on this topic and support that control of skin water loss during the first 2 months of life might benefit infants with potential higher risk of AD.",1

"Conclusion
Available data indicate that antipsychotic medications have modest efficacy when used in individuals with dementia. These medications are associated with significant adverse effects including CVAEs and death when used in this population. Among the atypical drugs, risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole appear to have stronger data in treating psychosis, aggression and agitation when compared with quetiapine. There are no controlled data on the use of the newer atypical antipsychotic medications in individuals with dementia. Typical antipsychotics also have modest efficacy when used in individuals with dementia with no superiority noted for any particular drug. These medications should be used in individuals with dementia only when nonpharmacological management has failed to provide benefit. Antipsychotics appear to be particularly effective for more severe symptoms. Controlled data for the use of these medications in individuals with LBD and VD are currently unavailable.",1

"Conclusions
This was the first school-based cluster RCT to examine the effects of a school gardening, nutrition, and cooking program on obesity measures and blood pressure. While the intervention did not reduce obesity parameters or blood pressure, it did result in significant and meaningful increases in vegetable intake. The effects of increase vegetable intake on obesity markers might just take longer to reduce obesity markers in pediatric populations. In addition, it important to examine how increased vegetable intake may result in other improvements in health parameters, beyond obesity parameters. We intend to assess the effects of the Texas Sprouts intervention on a variety of metabolic measures obtained from the fasting blood draw, such as glucose, HbA1c, lipids, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory markers. In addition, we intend to assess the effects of the Texas Sprouts intervention on diet-related psychosocial data, energy, macronutrients, healthy eating index, and skin carotenoids, in the near future. We can also examine what behavior changes mediated the increases in vegetable intake and other potential health improvements. School-based garden programs are effective at reaching large numbers of children, fit well into existing school standards and curriculum, provide opportunities for schools to meet nutrition education mandates, and have consistently resulted in increasing vegetable intake in children. There is a need for longer-term follow-up of school-based garden programs. There is also a need to better engage parents in school-based garden programs. Sustaining school garden programs is also challenging. School gardens should be assimilated more into the school culture and curriculum, used by more teachers and students, integrated more into the foodservice and cafeteria, and supported and used more by parents and the community. Research is warranted to help schools succeed at sustaining their school gardening programs.",1
"Conclusion
The reviewed studies highlighted the need for further quantitative and qualitative research on the sexual performance and outcomes of patients with MRKH syndrome. Design and development of a comprehensive tool to address all aspects and factors affecting the quality of sexual function of these patients can also play a significant role in creating reliable knowledge and planning appropriate treatment. More detailed studies based on the grades of MRKH syndrome can provide clearer information to facilitate the choice of treatment according to each individual patient’s physical characteristics.",1

"5. Conclusions
In summary, it was possible to observe that the flavonoids were able to protect the gastric and/or duodenal mucosa against different induction models that mimic the ulcer in men (ethanol, NSAIDs, stress and pyloric ligation), through multiple mechanisms of action such as cytoprotectors (increased mucus), antioxidants (increased activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and GSH levels), immunoregulatory (reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines), antisecretory (reduction in H+) and anti-H. pylori. Thus, they can potentially be used as preventive and complementary drugs or as dietary supplements to prevent the development of peptic ulcer and its episodes of recurrence and/or assist in the traditional treatment of ulcerative lesions. Many products of natural origin, especially composed of plant foods and plants, often referred to as complementary and alternative medicines, such as nutraceuticals and herbal medicines, respectively, have stood out for their therapeutic properties, which can assist in the management of many diseases.",1

"Conclusion
We have developed a Chinese Nutritional Literacy Scale for end-stage kidney disease patients receiving dialysis with good overall reliability and validity. The reliability and validity of this scale must be verified in additional study cohorts and in clinical practice. This foundational study suggests that the overall nutritional literacy of Chinese ESKD patients receiving dialysis is low, especially older rural patients with limited formal education. The Nutritional Literacy Scale associated not only with nutritional status but also with quality of life.",1
"5. Conclusion
In this large, nationwide study including the first six birth cohorts of girls offered quadrivalent HPV vaccine through the national immunisation programme in Norway, no association between HPV vaccination and risk of CFS/ME was observed. Medical history was associated with both increased risk of CFS/ME and lower uptake of HPV vaccine. The current findings support the favourable safety profile of quadrivalent HPV vaccine reported from other pre- and post-licensure studies.",1
"7. Conclusions
The first data obtained in the SLL confirm the early peopling of the
northwest Amazon basin during the end of the Ice Age and that at this
time this great biome was not a natural barrier for expansion of huntergatherers in South America. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the oldest
occupations occurred starting around 12,600 years before the present
and that the area was occupied throughout the Holocene. As a preliminary hypothesis, we propose an Andean origin for the first humans
in the SLL, if we take into account the geographical proximity of the
Colombian Andes, radiocarbon dates, similarities in lithic technology
and the natural routes (rivers and valleys) connecting the highlands and
lowlands. Similarities in rock art between SLL and Chiribiquete suggest
the creation of a cultural landscape that involves wider cultural interaction.
Our preliminary results (lithic tools, ecofacts and pictographs)
suggest a generalist subsistence strategy, combining hunting and the
consumption of tree fruits. Unlike other regions, for the moment we
have no evidence of the use of roots or wild crops, although a strategy
that involved a degree of forest management does appear likely. A
possibility that requires further exploration, is the presence of megafauna in the SLL, with implications for paleoecological dynamics and
reconstruction, as well as human subsistence strategies and adaptations.
The extensive rock art not only hints at the coeval presence of humans
and megafauna in the landscape, but also that megaherbivores were a
component of the hunters’ diet, an interaction confirmed in contexts
from the Bogota Plateau. The timing of the colonisation of Amazonia
during the YD presents a compelling context that will be essential to
understand the establishment and long-term biodiversity trajectory of
Amazonia.",1
"Conclusion
In summary, our results show that exosomes are efficient tools for gene drug delivery
to the ischemic cortex. In addition, exosomes loaded with miR-30d-5p can reverse ischemiainduced, autophagy-mediated brain injury by promoting M2 microglial/macrophage
polarization. Our study suggests that treatment with exosomes from miR-30d-5poverexpressing ADSCs during the acute phase of stroke could be a promising therapeutic
strategy for ameliorating cerebral injury by inhibiting the inflammatory response.",1
"The presented results underline the importance of EV-based miR-transfer for endothelial function and regeneration. Although a steadily increasing body of evidence is gathering for this mechanism, no therapeutic applications have yet been made available for patients. This is partly due to the fact that EVs are complex structures, which are difficult and costly to produce on a large scale. In our study, we found, that miR-Protein interaction is involved in regulating endothelial function in CKD patients. In our opinion, it is a promising approach to influence miR-levels in endogenous EVs, rather than trying to apply exogenous EVs. Thus, hnRNPU may be a suitable candidate for this approach.",1
"Conclusion
The new, unexpected reality of HG, albeit temporary,
adds to the already vulnerable and transparent psychic state of pregnancy, and can lead to isolation from
the fetus, ambivalence for ending an otherwise desirable pregnancy, escape and/or aggression fantasies.

help the pregnant woman reframe and restore her
feelings toward the baby and the pregnancy, reducing
the accompanying distress.",1
"While the present article was under review, a study was published claiming that the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A variant was associated with breast cancer (Møller & Hovig, 2017). This conclusion was based on the detection of the variant in 17 out of 714 (2.4%; 95%CI 1.4%–3.8%) Norwegian unrelated breast cancer kindreds, a frequency significantly higher (p < 0.0001) compared to the prevalence of the variant in a sample of the Norwegian population (3/1588 = 0.2%). Segregation data based on a single family was inconclusive (LR 0.36), and the estimate of prospective incidence rate in 24 variant carriers overlapped that for the general population. The authors concluded (assumedly based on their case-control findings alone) that carriers of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A variant have increased risk for breast cancer in families selected due to aggregation of breast cancer, and state in their discussion “…carriers of the variant should be informed that they probably have a clinically actionable pathogenic variant and referred to health care accordingly”. We believe that the conclusion of Moller and Hovig (2017) is unjustified, and disagree with their recommendation on clinical action. Our much larger study (sample size 59x for cases and 26x for controls) including individuals from multiple different countries provide no evidence for increased risk of breast cases in familial cases carrying this variant: the OR was 1.03 (95% CI 0.86–1.24) including all studies, and the risk estimate was nominally greater although not significantly different (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89–1.33) after excluding familial breast cancer cohorts.",1
"In conclusion we have shown that in peripheral blood of RA patients, the postrituximab BCR repertoire is mainly composed of fewer but more dominant and more mutated BCR clones. In the synovial tissue, changes in BCR clonality are observed at later time points compared with peripheral blood, which could explain in part the relatively slow onset of clinical efficacy of rituximab treatment. Patients who do not respond to rituximab at 3 months show incomplete depletion of the baseline BCR clonal repertoire in peripheral blood within the first month of treatment, revealing a promising early predictive marker of clinical response.",1
"Conclusion:
This work highlights the association between
COX-2 expression and progression of NPC so, it

in this study, the significant relationship between
the decline in claudin 4 expression with both the

"Conclusion
In summary, different iron compounds induce individual levels
of toxicity in hepatoma cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent
manner. An expansive modulation of genes related to Fe homeostasis was mounted by toxic iron. Our findings suggest that a

exposition can be accomplished by hepatic cells.",1
"Conclusion
There is mounting evidence of a robust association between patients with type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of common cancers (i.e., pancreatic, endometrial and breast cancer, but also colorectal, hepatocellular, gallbladder, and kidney cancers). Understanding the mechanistic pathways underlying this risk is crucial to allow evidence-based prevention policies.",1
"In summary, in this research, the biomechanical properties of Coflex and X-STOP were explored through simulating the degenerated intervertebral disc model using finite element analysis. The results revealed that Coflex and X-STOP devices could retain most of the ROM in surgical segment levels, maintain the stability of lumbar spinal segments, and reduce intradiscal pressure. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in ROM and intradiscal pressure at the adjacent segment levels before and after implantation of Coflex or X-STOP devices, which indicated that the interspinous spacers played an important role in relieving or avoiding the degeneration at the adjacent segment levels. This suggests that Coflex and X-STOP devices had better biomechanical characteristics and could become an effective and alternative method for spinal fusion treatment or conservative therapy. In addition, the model developed in this study can be exploited not only for simulating and analyzing a single implant, but also for comparison among different types and models of implants at a single segment level in future studies.",1
"DIscussion and conclusions
This scoping review explored what is known about
the use of menstruation and fertility tracking apps.
The number of such apps is large, they are growing,
and they are increasingly popular. There is enormous
variation in the types of apps38 available, ranging from
very simple diaries through to apps that use complex,
sometimes proprietary, algorithms to determine ovulation and fertility windows. A survey of 1000 women
indicates that nearly 80% of women intend to use a
fertility tracker app in the future.35
The review has a number of limitations that may
reduce its usefulness. For example, given our resources,
it was only possible to include studies published in the
English language. Our particular search terms and
other delimiters may also have inadvertently excluded
other materials that may otherwise have been included.
The disciplinary and methodological heterogeneity of
papers means that comparing the different studies is
complex and it is challenging to apply quality assessment criteria to studies that are so varied.
This review highlighted how women are motivated
to use menstruation and fertility tracking apps for a
range of reasons but that their motivations and goals
shift over time and can overlap. Previous research
highlighted the complexities of both defining pregnancy intention and women’s experiences of reproduction.39 Existing apps do not necessarily take into
account the way in which women use such apps and
human–computer interaction researchers highlight
the importance of involving users in their design and
development.40 41 This is especially important because
the user is considered to be the single greatest ‘risk
factor’ in the accuracy of apps, and this is particularly
significant if women are seeking to prevent, or plan, a
pregnancy.37
The evidence suggests that women value apps that
are accurate and based on scientific evidence regardless of whether they are relying on the app to predict
their fertile window or not.21 There is limited research
on apps that specifically support pregnancy planning
but the evidence that does exist suggests that popular
apps which contain information on planning a pregnancy are not always accurate, which could be very
misleading for women and couples that are trying for
a baby.29
The review highlights a growing evidence base on
apps marketed to prevent pregnancy with evidence
suggesting that some apps are useful for women who
do not want to rely on hormonal methods of contraception or do not want to use condoms.16–19 31 However,
not all apps accurately predict the fertile window and
women may be using apps for pregnancy prevention
that have not been designed for this purpose.36 Given
this issue and the fact that fertility apps are used fluidly
over time, this poses the potential risk of unintended
pregnancy.
While there are many apps available for download
there is little discussion surrounding the regulation of
fertility and menstruation apps. Guidance is available
for both app developers and individuals seeking to
receive approval via the FDA42 43 for Mobile Medical
Application (MMA). The FDA have approved many
different types of MMAs for use across different health
disciplines42 43 but, as noted earlier, NaturalCycles17–19
is the only app to have been granted approval as a
contraceptive,44 45 and the DaysyView app supports the
class I medical device Daysy.31 The recently published
Joint BASHH/FSRH Standard for Online and Remote
Providers of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services
may be useful going forward.46
The limited evidence base that exists within this field
means there is considerable scope for future research.
As demonstrated across the various studies, there is
a need for further prospective independent research
free from commercial interests and risk. Consequently,
it is important that future research involve users that
reflect ethnic, cultural and geographical diversity, as
well as differences across the life course. The role of
menstruation and fertility tracker apps in developing
countries is also significantly under-researched. The
involvement of fertility specialists and other health
professionals should also be an important aspect of
future research and development in this field.

"Conclusions
In this study we identified numerous genomic regions significantly associated with indicators of HS response in lactating sows. The significant variants have small effects, indicating the highly polygenic nature of the traits evaluated. The candidate genes for physiological and anatomical indicators of HS response are associated with gene ontology terms and pathways involved in heat shock proteins activities, immune response, and oxidative cellular stress. The indicators of HS response exhibited pleiotropic effects, suggesting that multiple genomic regions influence various physiological and anatomical indicators of HS response. Many candidate genes with potential pleiotropic effects are associated with catalytic activities to reduce cell damage from oxidative stress and cellular mechanisms related to immune response were identified, providing valuable insights for breeding programs aimed at improving HS resilience in pigs. The findings have significant implications for advancing breeding programs aimed at improving heat tolerance in pigs.

"Finally, the present study may also offer a novel explanatory angle for consolidating seemingly contradictory findings related to whether repeated exposure to adversity or collective traumas leads to sensitization (e.g., [57–59]) or desensitization (e.g., [60–62]) to subsequent potential traumas (see also [63]). Our findings suggest that the affective responses to specific exposures may be critical in determining subsequent responses to similar potential threats or traumas. This logic is consistent with psychotherapy techniques in which the evocation of trauma-related emotional responses during therapy is a key feature of successful treatment. Specifically, prolonged exposure therapy (PET), a common evidence-based treatment for PTSD [64], involves repeated recall of a traumatic event over time. During treatment, clients are encouraged to maintain a high but tolerable level of distress during repeated exposures to the trauma narrative, in a process known as systematic desensitization. Our study suggests similar processes might be at play when repeated media coverage about a terrorist attack or incident of mass violence focuses less on the death and destruction caused by the attack and more on the strength and resilience of the affected communities in the wake of such tragedies.",1
"The present study has several limitations that should be pointed out. First, it was not possible to conclude whether changes in gene expression were the cause or consequence of the complex physiological environment in patients with type 2 DM. Furthermore, the sample size of EPCs was relatively small (n=4 for each group). Third, due to the lack of a sorting machine, the EPCs in the present study were isolated and cultured in culture dishes. EPCs isolated from the patients in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital were cultured in vitro while CD34+ cells were directly sorted in GSE43950. Therefore, the fold changes of identified hub genes may not fit well with the predicted outcomes of microarrays in GSE43950. Finally, as the clinical traits in the dataset GSE43950 were limited, the exact clinical characteristics of these patients were not known. In the current, the probes were annotated using the platform annotation file, which was last updated in July 09, 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL10379). Therefore, some proteins discovered in the past few years may not be identified in the present study.",1
"Conclusions
CSF-VDRL is highly specific but insensitive as a widely used diagnostic method. When CSF-VDRL is nonreactive, some other indicators should be considered. In our study, neurological symptoms, CSF TPPA titer, CSF protein, CSF WBC were identified as independent predictors of neurosyphilis. Especially, CSF TPPA had high sensitivity, specificity and AUC. Therefore, we suggested that CSF TPPA should be considered as an alternative test for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Combining with neurological symptoms, CSF protein, CSF WBC, the diagnosis would have a higher sensitivity.",1
"SECTION 4.Conclusion
A tailoring design of a broadband MA in visible light region based on a single layer of metal-dielectric-metal configuration was studied numerically. The absorption bandwidth and absorption performances were controlled by turning the shape and metal material of resonator shape. The absorption band was significantly increased with decreasing the order of rotational symmetry of patch resonator. Using the gold configuration, the broadband absorption response of the MA structure based on the 2-fold symmetry of the DSA shaped resonator over the entire visible light and apart of infrared spectrum range from 320 nm to 982 nm with absorptivity above 90% for both TE and TM polarizations was obtained. The physical mechanism of broadband absorption was investigated by the current, electric and magnetic distributions, contributed by propagating surface plasmon (PSP) and localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances. In addition, the high absorber performances of DSA shaped MA structure over entire visible light region (400 nm–700 nm) can be achieved for both noble metal of gold and low-cost metal of nickel configurations, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for visible light applications.",1
"The current study is the first to report on cancer incidence and mortality in adults exposed to asbestos as children. This is a unique cohort of nearly 2,500 children with quantitative measures of asbestos exposure, exposure to a known asbestos type (crocidolite) and good follow-up. Most of this cohort has now reached an age when chronic adult diseases are becoming more prevalent and potential associations between adult disease and childhood exposures can be explored. We observed an increase in overall cancer incidence and mortality as well as increased mortality for some specific non-cancer diseases. This was more evident in the males than females. Some of these increases, particularly non-cancer mortality, may have been due to lifestyle and behavioral characteristics of the cohort and be influenced by where they currently live. However, a potential affect of early life asbestos exposure on cancer incidence cannot be discarded. The cohort will continue to be followed to investigate disease morbidity as well as continuing mortality and will provide important information on the long-term implications of exposure to asbestos in childhood.",1
"5. Conclusions
Most studies reported positive outcomes for probiotics regarding the symptoms of GERD. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the outcomes and symptoms. Thus, although the results are encouraging, it is difficult to draw any general conclusions on the effects of probiotics. The heterogeneity in endpoints also made it impossible to quantitively evaluate the results. Further, the quality of the studies is concerning—only 5 of 14 studies were good quality. Nevertheless, despite the diversity in the studied product formats, populations, and experimental designs, the efficacy of the probiotic treatment does not appear to be influenced by the study quality.
Properly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with a sufficient number of participants and well-defined endpoints are needed. Studies with a longer duration should also be considered, with an intermediate analysis of the endpoints—for example, through questionnaires—to determine the period in which the benefits can be expected and whether they are long-lasting.",1
"We identified 28 MDD-related genes and constructed a weighted
gene co-expression network of MDD. A significant module that had a
negative relation with MDD was obtained by WGCNA and was selected
for detailed analysis. The genes in the selected module were used to
construct a PPI network and were significantly enriched in 10 KEGG
pathways and 17 GO biological process terms. The top five genes (FOS,
GNGT1, JUN, EGR1, CCL4) in the PPI network with high degree values
were identified and analyzed. A TF-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network
in MDD was constructed and used to identify the top 10 genes, which
included three hub genes, six lncRNAs, and one miRNA according the
degree value in the regulatory network. Five of these genes have been
associated with MDD previously, whereas the other five need further
analysis. Together, our results provide a novel approach to understanding the underlying genes, biological processes, signaling pathways,
and related mechanisms of MDD, as well as for the mining of diagnostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets of MDD. ",1

HF hospitalisation and improve the HF symptoms in HFmEF
and HFpEF patients. In the future, additional well-designed
RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and investigate
whether sacubitril-valsartan has distinct benefits for HFmEF

"Conclusion
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and found that interventions using smartphone apps or physical activity trackers have a significant small-to-moderate effect in increasing physical activity (1850 steps daily). These interventions were more effective when including text-messaging or personalisation features. Given the wide and increasing reach of smartphones, even modest improvements in physical activity can produce large effects at the population level. Longer-duration studies with more diverse populations should explore long-term effectiveness and sustained engagement.

"Conclusion
The analysis indicated that that femoral neck, intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures incidence decreased for the population of patients aged 65 and older in the U.S. between 2009 and 2019. Treatment of head and neck fractures was mainly performed through arthroplasty, while intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures predominantly received an intramedullary nailing. Despite decreasing incidences, proximal femoral fractures represent a clinical challenge in geriatric trauma care.",1
"5. Conclusion
This study suggested that EA at bilateral Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) acupoints can enhance the sedative effects on propofol anesthesia in low-frequency stimulation but reduce the sedative effects in high-frequency stimulation (50 Hz). Low-frequency EA affected the sympathetic-vagal balance, which increased vagal activity and decreased sympathetic activity in ratios. In light of these results, the effectiveness of the sedative effects of EA in the perioperative period is promising.",1
"3 Conclusion
In this work, we propose a coplanar CAAC–IGTO synaptic TFT. The CAAC–IGTO semiconductor could be manufactured by just thermal annealing of a-IGTO at 700 °C in O2 furnace. The TFT shows ferroelectric-like characteristic,[58] showing a counter-clockwise hysteresis in transfer curves, in which −12.5 V of memory window is found at the gate sweep range of ±20 V with VDS = 0.1 V. Applying pre-synaptic spike to the gate induces migration of Vo+ that allows to control polarization bound charges in the semiconductor layer, modulating the channel conductance. This is the mechanism mimicking the electrical properties of biological synapse such as IPSC, PPD, and LTP at VDS = 0.1 V. The advantage of this device is that it is possible to use a conventional gate insulator such as SiO2. Compared to previous works,[17, 28-34] this work can get rid of the inevitable use of a functional gate insulator to implement synaptic characteristics. Accordingly, large scale integration of the synaptic devices can be possible. In addition, MO TFTs with extremely low leakage currents, widely used for display manufacturing, could be used.[22-24] With these advantages, CAAC–IGTO synaptic TFT can be a good candidate as an artificial synapse for highly integrated neuromorphic electronics in the future.",1

"Summary
Communicating one’s scientific findings to peers and the general public is integral to the scientific endeavor. Without informing our discipline about our important results, theories cannot be updated, and knowledge cannot be accumulated. Likewise, disseminating our findings to the public and policymakers can shape public discourse and encourage the implementation of more scientifically accurate policies. However, due to a lack of training and structural support, scientists may be unaware of the potential social impact of their findings. For example, an artificial intelligence expert might build an excellent new generative language model but may unintentionally overlook their model’s bias when it comes to indigenous populations. Unfortunately, once a specific finding with a particular interpretation has gained public traction, updating or correcting the interpretation requires significant efforts that often fail (e.g., the impact of an infamous study on vaccine skepticism; [127,128]).

Should such potential implications dissuade researchers from conducting socially impactful research? As scientists, we believe that scientific and social progress hinges on searching for empirical truths and better theories and that potential misuse of a scientific study should typically not provide sufficient grounds for not publishing or conducting it in the first place. However, we also believe that social responsibility and scientific merit are not diametrically opposed. Therefore, in the spirit of the recent push towards more active engagement with the social impact of scientific research (e.g., [47,52,129–131]), we suggested 10 simple rules to help scientists consider socially responsible aspects of their work. By following these suggestions, we believe that scientists will be better able to foresee and minimize potential harms and, at the very least, be better prepared for post-publication discussions related to their research.

We recognize that these recommendations work, at times, against the authors’ incentives and are not a substitute for structural change in how scientific research is conducted and rewarded. This conflict of interest between publishing socially responsible science and the authors’ incentives is especially harsh for early career researchers who need publications in prestigious journals to get a permanent job. Therefore, we call on scientific societies, research institutions, and funding agencies to take active steps to encourage and reward social responsibility. Given the broader societal implications and the unintended harm that has already been caused time and again, we believe there is no better time than the present to start engaging with this important topic.

"Conclusions
The results of the voting by the Asian experts both before and after the hybrid virtual/face-to-face working meeting showed >80% concordance (Supplementary Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2023.101541) with the ESMO recommendations for the treatment of patients with MBC. Following the virtual ‘face-to-face’ discussions, revisions were made to the wording of ‘recommendations 3c, 3h, 3o, 3p, 5b, 5d, 7b and 8d’ and the addition of a new recommendation ‘recommendation 6a’ (Table 1) and resulted in a 100% consensus being achieved in terms of ‘acceptability’ for all the recommendations listed in Table 1.
Thus, the recommendations listed in Table 1 can be considered to constitute the consensus clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with MBC in Asia. As mentioned previously, the acceptance of each recommendation by each of the Asian experts was based on the available scientific evidence and was independent of the approval and reimbursement status of certain procedures and drugs in their individual countries. A summary of the availability of the recommended treatment modalities and recommended drugs, as of March 2023, is presented for each participating Asian country in Table 2 and will obviously impact on some of the disease and patient management strategies that can be adopted by certain Asian countries.",1
"This study is one of the first investigating the neurogenic response of juvenile female
rats to an early life physiological stressor followed by an immune challenge in early
adolescence. The results suggest an interaction between MS and LPS that induces aberrant
microglial activity that could impact the dendritic complexity of new neurons in the juvenile
period and potentially also in later in life. Although we did not include subregion as a factor in
statistical analysis, the results of the current study still show that MS potentiated LPS-induced
increase in IL-1 in the vHi. However, there was no difference in sensitivity between the dHi
and vHi to MS or LPS-induced changes in microglial activation and the number of DCX positive
cells. On the other hand, it should be noted that MS exacerbated LPS-induced reductions in
complexity of distal dendrites of new neurons in whole hippocampus without a distinction
between the dHi and vHi. Finally, further research is needed to determine the effects of early
life (postnatal and juvenile) stress in females, on behavioural consequences particularly in

"Conclusion
In this study, we have developed a multi-omics data integration framework that significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of complex diseases and demonstrates stable prediction performance across various datasets. By adeptly compressing high-dimensional data, extracting key biologically relevant features, and further leveraging omics-specific classifiers along with true class probability optimization, our framework has demonstrated superior disease classification performance compared to SOTA methods. Rigorous validation across datasets confirms the robustness and effectiveness of our model, which also serves as a potent tool for identifying critical biomarkers. These biomarkers offer profound insights into disease diagnosis and the underlying mechanisms, potentially guiding the development of targeted therapies. Thus, our work is a significant stride toward advancing precision medicine and sets the stage for subsequent research to enhance disease prediction and treatment.",1
"Conclusions
In this cohort study, infants exposed to antenatal MgSO4 showed potentially enhanced brain connectivity reflected in stronger voxelwise functional connectivity, segregation, and integration on fMRI at term-equivalent age. These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which administration of antenatal MgSO4 when birth is imminent at a gestational age of 30 to 34 weeks may be neuroprotective for the preterm infant brain. Future studies exploring the association between these MRI findings and neurodevelopmental outcomes will assist with their interpretation.",1
"In conclusion, miR-26a-5p was downregulated in the USM tissues of pregnant women with PTB. Additionally, miR-26a-5p lowered intracellular Ca2+ levels, and inhibited the CPI17/PKC/PLCγ pathway, and inactivated the calcium channels in LPS-exposed USM cells by targeting TRPC3. This study suggests that the miR-26a-5p/TRPC3 axis may be a promising therapeutic target for PTB treatment.",1
"Conclusion
In conclusion, let us ask it one final time “… to achieve scientific impact, should we ‘game the system’ and exploit these non-scientific features to our advantage?” Although our meta-analysis pointed out that some non-scientific features can be used to increase the probability of being cited, the temporal variability of their relevance jeopardizes any “recipes for success” based on their use. Consequently, if we want citations to be used as a measure of scientific quality, the answer is “no”, but the fact that citations remain among the most important metric for academics, especially early career researchers, is of sufficient magnitude to warrant constant reflection on our publication practices. To this end, our method can act as a benchmark to monitor the influence of these features over time. Ideally, to adopt citation counts as a measure of scientific quality, effect sizes in Fig. 2 should be zero for most of themes addressed. This can be achieved by monitoring new literature being published on the subject to see how these effects vary in the years ahead.",1

"Conclusion
Cerebrovascular Accidents cause life changing effects within individuals daily
functioning. Individuals who have experienced a CVA suffer from symptoms such as
aphasia, impaired cognition, lack of confidence and several other symptoms that causes
dependency. Encouraging CVA survivors to participate in discharge recommendations at
a vigorous level (4-5 days per week) and maintain a healthy level of physical activity
may result in improvement in HRQOL related scores. This study adds to the research 
32
pertaining to the benefits of continuous participation in discharge recommendations for
individuals who have experienced a CVA.
The recruitment of CVA survivors to rehabilitation research is challenging, some
individuals are eager to participate, and some would rather not due to various reasons.
The researcher needs to focus on providing individuals the opportunity to participate
while controlling for over enthusiastic individuals. The researcher also should develop
strategies to recruit and include those individuals living with a CVS who would rather not
participate.
Though the study sample was relatively small and limited there was an inherit
bias towards CVA survivors who already had an interest to participate in rehabilitation
research and members of the Center. Future research should also consider the
methodological implication of utilizing a traditional paper form assessment. “This is
contradictory to the ongoing digitalization of society and needs to be further explored”

Proxalutamide avoided the progression of the disease in patients at later and more severe states of COVID19, leading to a remarkable reduction in mortality rate, particularly in patients that required oxygen (scores

South arms for different outcomes, which reinforces the consistency of the findings. Whether the level of

"5. Conclusions
Both VA-ECMO and the Impella family of devices play a role in the contemporary management of PIVSR and offer distinct advantages and disadvantages, depending on the clinical scenario. The limited case numbers reported demonstrated feasibility, safety, and recommendations for optimal management. Utilization of these devices may allow for a period of hemodynamic stabilization, end-organ resuscitation, and an extended time of stability to delay definitive surgical closure of PIVSR to a time when tissue handling will be more technically facile. However, this must be balanced with the possibilities of unique MCS complications; current literature is not robust enough to elucidate the optimal timing for surgical repair in this regard. Additional prospective multi-institution studies would be welcome to evaluate these MCS options in a more robust and translational manner.",1
"5 Conclusions
In a modern scientific community in which “publish or perish” is still mandatory and h-index is considered a sound metric to value scholars, quantity is frequently prioritized over quality. Although peer-reviewers usually defend the scientific community's integrity, the publication process is not perfect and it can miss its target, as reported here about the COVID-19 pandemic. Open access and fast track paths to publication are useful tools but might represent a menace if left unchecked since the former can be an incentive to accept manuscripts, and the latter can lead to lower quality threshold and reduced attention by peer-reviewers.

It is reasonable to assume the retracted articles found in this review are just the tip of an iceberg of dubious-value publications pre- and during the pandemic. During times of great stress, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this should be considered a menace for the integrity of modern science as well as for the well-being of the global community since unchecked facts and fake evidence are the ground on which fake news thrive.",1

"5. Conclusions
High heat shock temperatures did not enhance germination in the investigated Astragalus species; instead, the seeds remained dormant. This observation demonstrates the tolerance of seeds with physical dormancy to fire-induced heat. Ecologically, this indicates that even after a fire event, seeds can remain stored in the soil until dormancy is broken by specific environmental cues, such as scarification. This process has crucial ecological implications for post-fire recovery and persistence in fire-prone ecosystems, highlighting the interplay between fire, dormancy, and regeneration strategies in these ecosystems. In addition, the variability in seed imbibition patterns has ecological implications, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of germination processes in different species and ecosystems. Mechanical scarification is highly effective for breaking seed dormancy in A. verrucosus and A. maritimus, confirming the presence of physical dormancy. These findings point to the ecological diversity and adaptation of plant species to their specific environments, emphasizing the need for tailored conservation and management strategies. For instance, narrow endemic species in fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems, such as those here studied, have survived and adapted to particular environments favored by fires, where seed dormancy has allowed these species to compete with dominant plant communities and take advantage of bare patches of vegetation created by fires for seedling growth.",1
"Conclusion
Food insecurity and family violence are significant societal problems, with evidence that both have increased in prevalence and severity due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides initial evidence for a bi-directional relationship between food insecurity and family violence in high income countries. Populations experiencing food insecurity and family violence are both vulnerable and hard to reach, so gaining a clear understanding of their experiences is difficult. Future studies and policy making decisions will require the engagement of these communities to ensure that proposed supports and solutions are appropriate and will be effective .",1

"To summarize, based on multivariate analyses of lesion location and indirect measures of disconnection, our results extend a previous study with this data set and partly confirm similar recent studies on the role of lesion locations in PSDS. Specifically, we identified an association of lesions in the right insular cortex, right putamen and inferior frontal gyrus with PSDS. Furthermore, structural disconnection in the white matter of the right temporal lobe was associated with PSDS, but there was no evidence for a contribution of functional diaschisis to PSDS. These analyses show the potential of indirect measures of disconnection and diaschisis for structure–function inference. Still, even larger cohorts, which include patients with aphasia and a more detailed behavioral characterization, are needed to leverage the full potential of LNSM and SDSM for our understanding of PSDS.",1

"In summary, our studies clearly show that lung compartments of rhesus macaques that control M. tuberculosis infection are populated with high levels of M. tuberculosis–specific T cells producing IFN-γ and IL-17. These cells coexpress CXCR3 and CCR6, and their presence correlates with lowered M. tuberculosis burdens in the lung. Our study also highlights the unique value of the macaque model of LTBI for studying correlates of protective immunity to TB at mucosal sites of infection. Future studies include understanding the crosstalk between innate immune cells and development of M. tuberculosis–specific T cell responses in the BAL and lungs of animals that progress to TB versus those that remain asymptomatic. In addition, perturbing the latent state by depleting specific immune cell subsets or by using immunosuppressive agents, such as SIV, will further extend our understanding of protective immunity to TB and advance the development of better vaccines and immune therapeutics.",1
"4 Conclusion
The MXene, mixed with chitosan at the 1:1 mass ratio, has displayed the best electrochemical performance at the calcination temperature of 800 ℃. When the current density is 3 A/g, the specific capacitance of 1MXene-1N is 286.28 F/g (154.59 C/g), the energy density is 21.47 Wh/kg, and the energy density is 2343.75 W/kg. This is far higher than the recently reported MXene doping material, such as N–Ti3C2 [31] and Ti3C2/MnO2 [49], acquiring the specific capacitance only of 192 F/g(at 1 mV/s) and 254 F/g (at 0.5 A/g) in three-electrode system. At the same time, the 1MXene-1N composite material was charged and discharged for 10,000 times when the current density was 10 A/g. It was found that the charge and discharge efficiency of the material is always more than 98%. Therefore, the doping N element in MXene can effectively improve the performance of supercapacitors.",1

"Conclusions
During seed dispersal, A. barbatum seeds are in the dormancy with undeveloped embryos. Under natural environmental circumstances, embryo development begins in early winter. The E/S ratio increases to from 0.33 to 0.78 before the radical emerges. Laboratory experiments showed that embryo growth was observed following long-time incubation under 4 °C. Seeds were able to germinate over a broad temperature range following cold stratification under 4 °C, and GA3 may be used as an alternative to cold stratification. We conclude that fresh seeds of A. barbatum display intermediate complex morphophysiological dormancy. Natural cold stratification in winter breaks dormancy, allowing seeds to germinate and sprout seedlings at the beginning of following growing season. Those findings are useful to horticulturists and seed ecologists in analyzing A. barbatum germination and promoting seed propagation.",1
"5. Conclusion
The results of separate studies on personality composition or
group size have often attributed similar findings to either mechanism independently (e.g. invasion biology [45,46]), while others
have profitably considered the eco-evolutionary consequences of
both colony composition and size simultaneously [10,29]. In our
system, the relative influence of group size and personality composition depended on the collective trait being considered. In
some cases, the differences in effect size were considerable and
counterintuitive. As such, we urge that future studies on
common models of collective behaviour (e.g. fish schools, bird
flocks, ant colonies, etc.) should manipulate both personality composition and group size simultaneously to elucidate
their interplay and relative contributions on a variety of
collective behaviours. In S. dumicola, naturally occurring
colonies vary considerably in their size–composition relationship, where larger groups generally contain a larger
proportion of bold individuals (F1,15 ¼ 16.3, p ¼ 0.001, r
2 ¼
0.54; electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Furthermore,
colony composition is probably not driven by within-group relatedness, as variable colony compositions arise among colonies
that share similar levels of within-group relatedness [40]. We
further wonder whether or how group size and group composition naturally covary in diverse systems; for instance, along
environmental gradients. We argue that these are vital next
steps towards a comprehensive understanding of the behavioural and evolutionary ecology of collective behaviours.

"Conclusion
Conclusively, this study demonstrates that Dp44mT significantly alleviated the iNOS and COX-2 expression and suppressed the inflammatory cytokine production by blocking NF-κB activation. Furthermore, Dp44mT significantly reduced the phagocytosis and decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Thus, the unique abilities of Dp44mT to reduce the levels of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α suggest that it can be a strong candidate for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases such as sepsis or COVID-19. However, inflammatory diseases complicated, and the anti-inflammatory activity of Dp44mT in COVID-19 in vivo models was not investigated in this study. Therefore, further study is required to elucidate potential effects of Dp44mT on various inflammation in vivo models before clinical applications.

"CONCLUSIONSThe present investigation demonstrated that putative drug binding pockets of key enzymesof ESKAPE pathogens have a higher degree of conservation than full length sequences,based on the extrapolation of experimentally-determined binding pockets of orthologs. Wepropose that conserved pocket sequence identity will mean that drugs or ligands interactingat one pocket will display the same inhibition at another and that the same chemical scaffoldcan be used as the basis of drug design for other enzyme orthologs.

A systems biology-based approach was used to identify putative ion channels in tumor growth and metastasis and their correlation with EMT-related genes through analysis of RNA-Seq and microarray-based expression profiles of patients with breast cancer. Amid the identified ion channels, also present were ion channels already established as prognostic markers in breast cancer. Functional annotations of the altered ion channels led to the identification of processes contributing to cell proliferation, cell migration and cell volume regulation in breast cancer. However, detailed mechanisms underlying the possible effects of the identified ion channels and their associations with EMT need to be further characterized in vitro and in vivo.",1

"In conclusion, the continued use of retracted data results in ongoing dissemination of bad science and scaremongering. It does women a disservice by potentially denying them a valuable treatment option through misinformation from an unsupported perception of harm. It is incumbent on physicians, scientists, and journal reviewers and editors to ensure that due diligence is performed on data, and that retracted data are not promulgated through secondary publications. Having reviewed the available data and conducted our own analysis, we believe that physicians and patients should have every confidence in using dydrogesterone when indicated in the treatment of threatened and/or recurrent miscarriage, and that this favourable safety profile should extend to its appropriate use in ART.

"To conclude, repeated anodal tDCS over lDLPFC concurrent with a challenging verbal WM task improved verbal WM performance only in the first of three daily
stimulation sessions. Furthermore, individual differences
in respondence to stimulation paired with WM practice
predicted the extent and direction of WM improvement
on a verbal and spatial transfer task (2 days after stimulation). More research is needed to determine which individuals may benefit the most from stimulation and why
some individuals may be negatively affected, as well as
to determine the optimal spacing of sessions for WM
learning to take place. With a growing aging population
and WM that is known to decrease over the lifespan,
future research in this direction may help delineate the
optimal parameters to use tDCS most effectively to
enhance WM functioning in a range of individuals.",1

as proved by in vitro experiment. Finally, BP nanosheets and gemcitabine encapsulated hydrogel exhibited high photothermal therapeutic effect in vivo and potential antitumor efficacy after
intratumoral administration because of the increased temperature
upon NIR irradiation and enhanced drug concentration in tumors.
Meanwhile, BP-GEM-GEL showed ignorable systemic toxicity. Consequently, we believe that the system has immense potential for

"SECTION 4.Conclusion
A tailoring design of a broadband MA in visible light region based on a single layer of metal-dielectric-metal configuration was studied numerically. The absorption bandwidth and absorption performances were controlled by turning the shape and metal material of resonator shape. The absorption band was significantly increased with decreasing the order of rotational symmetry of patch resonator. Using the gold configuration, the broadband absorption response of the MA structure based on the 2-fold symmetry of the DSA shaped resonator over the entire visible light and apart of infrared spectrum range from 320 nm to 982 nm with absorptivity above 90% for both TE and TM polarizations was obtained. The physical mechanism of broadband absorption was investigated by the current, electric and magnetic distributions, contributed by propagating surface plasmon (PSP) and localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances. In addition, the high absorber performances of DSA shaped MA structure over entire visible light region (400 nm–700 nm) can be achieved for both noble metal of gold and low-cost metal of nickel configurations, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for visible light applications.",1

This study describes the results of weight loss, remission of comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies of SG, RYGB and OAGB in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2). Long-term results with greater weight loss were obtained in OAGB, as was remission of dyslipidemia with respect to the RYGB and SG techniques. A greater trend was observed in the control of DM2, with lower glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin after OAGB. Except for iron deficiencies that were lower after SG, there were no significant differences in nutritional deficiencies between the different surgical techniques analyzed.",1
"In conclusion, researchers should consider using our multiple-trial paradigm (Crime–Lineup–Crime–Lineup) to obtain more data from fewer participants. Future research into multiple-trial designs should examine whether any systematic effects emerge beyond 24 trials or with any other paradigms (e.g., that of Meissner et al., 2005). Overall, a multiple-trial design for independent lineup trials can be an effective way of obtaining powerful datasets in lineup experiments, allowing researchers to examine more complex interactions than are typically tested and that could significantly contribute to our understanding of eyewitness decision making.

In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture alleviated the cognitive deficit of the mouse AD model, inhibited Aβ accumulation, and reduced neuronal apoptosis in the model. In addition, Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture possibly inhibits NLRP1 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis to exert its neuroprotective effect. These results suggested that Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture may serve as a promising strategy for AD treatment.",1
"Conclusion
The present findings suggest that interoceptive sensitivity, but not current peripheral physiological reactivity, may be implicated in experiences of affective realism. These findings motivate future work exploring how the brain utilizes information from and about the body during affective experience. Additionally, these findings suggest that individuals with greater interoceptive sensitivity may be less likely to project incidental affect onto others when making social judgments. This may have important implications for groups who tend to have poorer interoceptive ability (e.g., women, the elderly, or certain clinical populations; S. Khalsa et al., 2009; S. S. Khalsa et al., 2018; Moeini-Jazani et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2019).

"Conclusion
This study has certain limitations, including the limited number of references available for data comparison, the focus solely on studies conducted in rats, and the restriction to publications in the English language. Consequently, it is evident that studies on endometriosis pain management, specifically in experimental rat models, are scare. Thus, it is imperative to promote further research across various fields of knowledge to address this issue, encouraging funding and international collaboration. Only through these means can we establish a robust foundation of information and generate more substantial findings regarding effective treatments for controlling this type of pain. It is crucial to address this research gap, as endometriosis significantly impacts the quality of life of the affected women.",1
"Conclusion
In this study, we have developed a multi-omics data integration framework that significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of complex diseases and demonstrates stable prediction performance across various datasets. By adeptly compressing high-dimensional data, extracting key biologically relevant features, and further leveraging omics-specific classifiers along with true class probability optimization, our framework has demonstrated superior disease classification performance compared to SOTA methods. Rigorous validation across datasets confirms the robustness and effectiveness of our model, which also serves as a potent tool for identifying critical biomarkers. These biomarkers offer profound insights into disease diagnosis and the underlying mechanisms, potentially guiding the development of targeted therapies. Thus, our work is a significant stride toward advancing precision medicine and sets the stage for subsequent research to enhance disease prediction and treatment.",1
"Conclusion
In conclusion, let us ask it one final time “… to achieve scientific impact, should we ‘game the system’ and exploit these non-scientific features to our advantage?” Although our meta-analysis pointed out that some non-scientific features can be used to increase the probability of being cited, the temporal variability of their relevance jeopardizes any “recipes for success” based on their use. Consequently, if we want citations to be used as a measure of scientific quality, the answer is “no”, but the fact that citations remain among the most important metric for academics, especially early career researchers, is of sufficient magnitude to warrant constant reflection on our publication practices. To this end, our method can act as a benchmark to monitor the influence of these features over time. Ideally, to adopt citation counts as a measure of scientific quality, effect sizes in Fig. 2 should be zero for most of themes addressed. This can be achieved by monitoring new literature being published on the subject to see how these effects vary in the years ahead.",1

"5. Conclusions
We established a culture technology that could artificially produce wild ginseng root through in vitro culture. Small-molecule ginsenosides in the test substance, HLJG0701-β, were produced by bioconversion through steaming and fermentation. The total ginsenoside content of cultured wild ginseng root was increased after methyl jasmonate treatment (elicitor), and HLJG0701-β was developed by improving the manufacturing process. To verify the functionality of the new raw material, HLJG0701-β, we determined its AChE inhibitory effect and neuroprotective effects against Aβ25-35 and H2O2. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo evaluations, HLJG0701-β may be considered as a potent candidate for the inhibition of AChE activity and oxidative stress, and thus may be involved in improving memory deficit in mice. It also improved memory by increasing the activity of cholinergic nerves. The efficacious and safe dose of HLJG0701-β needs to be determined through future clinical trials. The results of this study suggest that HLJG0701-β can be developed as a raw material for healthy functional foods.",1

"Conclusions
We conclude that mHealth interventions can moderately increase PA in adults at the end of intervention, both compared with alternative nonmobile control groups and no or minimal control groups. PA increases are maintained in follow-up measurements taken after intervention but decrease over time. Population type seems to moderate the effect of mHealth intervention on PA, with higher effectiveness in sick and at-risk populations compared with healthy population samples. mHealth interventions with scalable and nonscalable intervention designs seem to be equivalent in terms of effectiveness. Further high-quality studies investigating scalable mHealth interventions with long-term follow-up measurements are needed to confirm our results. This study concludes that mHealth technologies might not only support sustainable behavior change toward more active lifestyles but also contribute to preventing and controlling chronic disease risk.",1
"5 Conclusion
This research has clearly demonstrated what are the contents of ultra high diluted succussed solution products. Hypericum perforatum L ultra highly diluted succussed solution products provide a good example to show the micro-nano structure of the final solutions independently of whether they are the result of trituration or extraction.
So, this research, which deals with the size of solute particles in ultra-highly diluted succussed solution products, proves, by a mathematical and experimental way, that the source materials are found in all solutions, even in the most diluted ones.
The results are contrary to what is believed up until now, and they clearly mark a new start in basic research in medicine, to understand and explore the action mechanisms of ultra-highly diluted succussed solution products.which are used by homeopaths as remedies. These same research findings can also be used for the standardization of the manufacturing process for ultra-highly diluted solutions.
Trituration is responsible at converting sparingly soluble raw materials into completely soluble, before they are turned into homeopathic solutions. In this research, it was found that beyond the reduction of grains size to a nano dimensional scale up to 6X potency, there is an appearance of functional groups in organic compounds in our mixture that did not exist in initial sample. It seems that in the case of Hypericum Perforatum L the trituration works mechanochemically. Also, there appears to be a change in the basic physicochemical properties such as the change in Electrical Conductivity and pH. The overall change of Electrical Conductivity is 96% and the total pH reduction is 22%, which seems like trituration changes the physical-chemical properties of raw starting material. It is obvious that nano-dimension is the one that predominates in these solutions. Thus, the succussion of the solutions leads the formation of aggregates when the particles are in the nanoscale. On the contrary when aggregates are already present succussion turns them into smaller particles. Also, zeta potential measurements confirm the colloidal nature or not and stability, of the solutions. In all samples the 200C potency seems to have a key role for the preparation and quality of next potencies and must be considered as the one with the maximum entropy, as it presents to be the turning point for the observed changes. The conditions and the quality of the preparation process have a key role for qualitative homeopathic ultra high diluted succussed medicinal products. Because our experimental and theoretical results revise what is believed for ultra high diluted succussed solution products, further research upon this field is an imperative.",1
"4. Conclusions
Twenty-four different bacterial blends with four different starter cultures were evaluated for their ability to ferment a pea protein matrix. The evaluation was based on acidification, texture, and volatile profile, including reduction of off-flavour and production of dairy-like compounds. Fast acidification was prioritized for safety reasons. Blends containing Vega™ Classic and Vega™ Harmony acidified significantly faster. The texture of the gels was not affected by the starter cultures, but the adjunct combination C3 (L. helveticus, Pediococcus, and L. plantarum) provided significantly higher firmness than C4 (L. helveticus, Pediococcus, L. plantarum and L. casei) and C5 (L. helveticus, Pediococcus, L. plantarum, L. casei and L. rhamnosus). Also blends containing Vega™ Classic and Vega™ Harmony removed greater levels of beany compounds, and blends containing adjunct cultures were more efficient at the reduction of these VOCs than those containing only starter cultures. In contrast, blends without adjuncts produced more dairy-like compounds such as 2,3-pentanedione than those with adjuncts, being bacterial blends including Vega™ Classic the most efficient at its production. Other desired VOCs contributing to cheese flavour such as diacetyl and acetoin were present in all fermented samples but no significant differences in their production by the different blends was observed. Future work on different ripening conditions will follow to further investigate the effect of different bacterial blends on texture and flavour development over time. The results of this study highlight the potential of fermentation to create gels with increased gel firmness and to improve the flavour profile of plant-based cheeses.",1

"5 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we identified five miRNAs as being downregulated in the plasma of patients with BC compared to healthy control individuals. Strikingly, expression trends for miR-130a-5p, miR-144-3p, and miR-152-3p were similar in both tissue and plasma. Besides, they were also significantly associated with sex hormone receptor, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis. All of plasma miRNAs them exhibit great potential in serving as promising noninvasive candidates for BC detection. Future prospective studies using a large cohort will be needed to confirm our findings.",1
"Conclusions
In this multi-institutional pooled analysis of patients with large RCC, SABR
appears to be a safe and tolerable treatment that achieves low rates of
recurrence. We observed a modest impact on renal function in the context of an
older and mainly medically inoperable population. Larger tumor size, higher
baseline creatinine, and worse performance status portended poorer prognosis
in this group. While limited by length of follow-up and partly retrospective
nature, these data nonetheless demonstrate favorable outcomes and provide
strong justification for further prospective study of SABR for large primary RCC.",1
"Conclusion
The present study provides the first detailed information on the abundance and calcification of living coccolithophores from the eastern Arabian Sea. G. oceanica was the most abundant species found in the study. Mangalore had the highest abundance of coccolithophores during the late SWM despite having the lowest pH. The high abundance off Mangalore was also captured in the PIC and particle backscatter data. Our study shows that coccolithophore abundance was regulated by nitrogen availability. Coccolithophores showed malformation in low pH waters during the late SWM. The malformation reported in this study is the first evidence from the Arabian Sea and would influence settling fluxes of PIC and organic matter in future high CO2 waters. Long-term in situ monitoring of coccolithophores and their controlling factors is required for the northern Indian Ocean, especially in the Arabian Sea to assess the decadal changes in their abundance, including a rise in their bloom formation in the Arabian Sea.",1

In conclusion, this study evaluated and compared the efficacy of two commercial rapid ICT AE and CE test kits with ELISA-based methods incorporating crude or partially purified E. granulosus and E. multilocularis metacestode-derived native antigens as tools in a sero-epidemiological study of human AE and CE prevalence and in the clinical differential diagnosis of patients suspected as having AE or CE. The ADAMU-AE and CE kits proved more effective in the clinical setting for the confirmation of suspected AE/CE cases, whereas the native antigen ELISA tests can provide useful information on the environmental rates of Echinococcus egg exposure at the population level.",1
"5. Conclusions
In this study, a 2-DE based MS approach was used to investigate Cu-toxicity-responsive proteins in Citrus leaves. Forty-one and 37 DAP spots were identified in 200, 300 and/or 400 μM Cu-treated C. grandis and C. sinensis leaves, respectively. Over 50% of these DAPs were involved in photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism, followed by antioxidation and detoxification, protein folding and assembly (viz., chaperones and folding catalysts), and signal transduction. More than 80% of these DAPs were identified only in C. grandis or C. sinensis leaves. More (Less) DAPs increased in abundances than DAPs decreased in abundances were identified in Cu-treated C. grandis (C. sinensis) leaves. Impaired PETC and decreased abundances of proteins involved in CO2 assimilation might be responsible for the Cu-induced inhibition of photosynthesis. Cu-toxicity affected the PETC more in C. sinensis leaves than in C. grandis leaves. DAPs related to antioxidation and detoxification, protein folding and assembly (viz., chaperones and folding catalysts), and signal transduction might be involved in Citrus Cu-toxicity and Cu-tolerance. Also, we identified some new DAPs (viz., LFNR2, SBPase, probable PGL4, ferritin, AdoHcy hydrolase and abscisic stress-ripening protein 1-like) that were not reported in leaves and/or roots (Figure 5). In conclusion, this study revealed some novel mechanisms on Cu-toxicity and Cu-tolerance in plants.",1

"Conclusions
The results of the voting by the Asian experts both before and after the hybrid virtual/face-to-face working meeting showed >80% concordance (Supplementary Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2023.101541) with the ESMO recommendations for the treatment of patients with MBC. Following the virtual ‘face-to-face’ discussions, revisions were made to the wording of ‘recommendations 3c, 3h, 3o, 3p, 5b, 5d, 7b and 8d’ and the addition of a new recommendation ‘recommendation 6a’ (Table 1) and resulted in a 100% consensus being achieved in terms of ‘acceptability’ for all the recommendations listed in Table 1.
Thus, the recommendations listed in Table 1 can be considered to constitute the consensus clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with MBC in Asia. As mentioned previously, the acceptance of each recommendation by each of the Asian experts was based on the available scientific evidence and was independent of the approval and reimbursement status of certain procedures and drugs in their individual countries. A summary of the availability of the recommended treatment modalities and recommended drugs, as of March 2023, is presented for each participating Asian country in Table 2 and will obviously impact on some of the disease and patient management strategies that can be adopted by certain Asian countries.",1
"Overall, study findings suggest that PCIT-ED and, in
particular, the novel ED module, showed added utility for the
treatment of depression in early childhood based on several
measures. Notably, the CDI also had a positive impact on
child depression as well. Also of interest was that all other
child outcomes, with the exception of CBCL externalizing
scores, were also reduced significantly more in therapy
compared to WL subjects during the ED module. Furthermore, and of importance, was the significant improvement in
caregiver stress evident only during ED compared to WL.
Analyses of change on the ECBI, the standard measure of
improvement in PCIT, that combined all treatment data
(including the group who received treatment after the wait
period) suggest that global improvement in child behavior is
occurring in CDI, PDI, and ED modules.
Findings from this study have important clinical implications and suggest that the modified version of PCIT for
depression, or PCIT-ED, may be needed for the most
effective treatment of early childhood depression. Also
notable was that CDI seems to be a key component of this
treatment response, even in the face of limited parental
mastery of skills in the abbreviated module. Findings
showed that neural response to reward, as well as several key
aspects of parenting relevant to the management of early
childhood depression and emotion management skills, are
uniquely targeted by the ED module. These findings underscore the importance of the focus on emotion development in the treatment of early childhood depression.
Findings also suggest that the ED module is useful for
improving overall functioning in keeping with the effects of
CDI and PDI. Findings suggest that modular approaches
whereby specific modules of the PCIT-ED are administered
depending upon the child characteristics and forms of
psychopathology may be most useful. Future studies that
provide rigorous tests of the efficacy of each module of
PCIT-ED are now needed to further clarify their utility in
varying forms of child psychopathology, to provide the most
personalized and streamlined treatment approaches.",1

"Conclusions
The observed concomitance of coding and non-coding SNVs or CNVs involving TBX4 or FGF10 loci in our subjects with lethal lung maldevelopment, including AcDys and CAD spectrum, supports the previously proposed role of a TBX4-FGF10-FGFR2 epithelial-mesenchymal signaling in lung organogenesis. Our studies also demonstrate that while heterozygous coding CNV deletions or SNVs involving FGF10 co-segregate with the LADD syndrome phenotype, and those involving TBX4 co-segregate in families with childhood-onset PAH, ischiocoxopodopatellar syndrome, or 17q23.1q23.2 deletion syndrome, these variants also can confer a significantly increased risk for lethal developmental lung disorders along a spectrum of growth arrest. However, the presence of a LoF variant per se cannot be used as a predictor of the likely phenotype in the subjects, since the additional modifier may be required for lung disease manifestation.
We provide evidence that biallelic variation at TBX4 or FGF10, as a compound inheritance model with rare coding and rare or common non-coding variant alleles, can result in a mutational burden and perturbation of the epithelial-mesenchymal signaling pathway involved in lung organogenesis, resulting in lethal lung disease. Functional characterization of non-coding regulatory variants in vitro or in animal models is necessary to gain further insight into their mechanistic role underlying human genetic disorders.",1
"5. Conclusions
In this paper, we compared two different methods to estimate the individual external doses of the public residing in the Fukushima Prefecture caused by radioactive fallout following the FDNPP accident in 2011. One is the method adopted by UNSCEAR, which makes use of the official soil deposition map. The other makes use of airborne monitoring maps, together with an empirical factor c = 0.15 obtained by comparing the large-scale 'glass-badge' dosemeter measurements and airborne surveys. Although the two are independent and are based on different data and methodologies, the resultant isodose lines for an annual additional dose of 1 mSv 3 and 5 years after the FDNPP accident show relatively good agreement. However, to improve the accuracy of long-term annual effective isodose lines, feedback from continuous measurements such as airborne monitoring is important.",1
"5. Conclusions
Distraction has the potential to be an effective and important tool in treatments with children. VR immerses the patient, and as a result, such a distractor is an effective method in reducing pain associated with needle-related procedures in children. Four of six of the included studies noted a large effect size of this kind of intervention. Thus, VR could increase psychophysical comfort especially in young patients. However, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the need for more research into the use of virtual reality as a distraction. Studies on larger groups, using similar conditions, can provide unequivocal evidence of the effectiveness of VR and enable the inclusion of such intervention in standard medical procedures.",1
"In conclusion, relatively light levels of prenatal alcohol exposure were associated with small yet significantly greater psychological and behavioral problems, including internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, attention deficits, and impulsiveness. These outcomes were linked to differences in cerebral and regional brain volume and regional surface area among exposed youths ages 9 to 10 years. Examination of dose-dependent relationships and light alcohol exposure patterns during pregnancy shows that children with even the lowest levels of exposure demonstrate poorer psychological and behavioral outcomes as they enter adolescence. Associations preceded offspring alcohol use and were robust to the inclusion of potential confounding factors and during stringent demographic matching procedures, increasing the plausibility of the findings. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from conception throughout pregnancy.",1
"Conclusions
The findings of Experiment 1 are consistent with a
theory positing that individuals with weaker language ability demonstrate increased reliance on lexical information
for speech perception compared to those with stronger receptive language ability. Increased reliance on lexical information among those with weaker receptive language
ability was observed for online lexical recruitment, but no
differences in lexically guided perceptual learning as a
function of language ability were observed. Individuals
with weaker receptive language ability therefore appear
to maintain an intact lexically guided perceptual learning mechanism. Further research is needed in order to
understand whether the relationship between lexical recruitment and language ability reflects compensation for
earlier deficits in speech perception and, if so, where in
the speech processing stream these deficits occur.
To the degree that the chosen measures accurately
capture lexical recruitment and lexically guided perceptual
learning at the level of individual participants, the findings
of both experiments converge to suggest no graded relationship between these two constructs. This result can be accommodated by current theories of speech perception if they
are modified to model this relationship as being governed
by a threshold level of lexical recruitment that is necessary and
sufficient to cue lexically guided perceptual learning",1

"CONCLUSION
This cross-sectional study on umbilical cord care at
five health centers in Rwanda revealed that the
mothers had a low level of knowledge and practice.
Our results showed two significant associations,
one between the mothers' knowledge and the
substance applied to the cord, and the number of
application days. Substances were applied to the
cord, which is not WHO recommendations, and
therefore, likely increases the duration the cord
remains intact, and more importantly, the increased
risk of cord infection due to the type of substance
applied. Health education on essential newborn care
practices should be integrated at the community
level, beginning with ANC care to all mothers,
whether they intend to give birth at the health
facility or their home. Re-emphasizing essential
newborn care knowledge and practice during
postnatal care will further discourage harmful
practices to prevent newborn infections and reduce
neonatal morbidity and mortality. ",1
"In summary, this randomized trial demonstrated that our opioid-sparing anesthesia was not superior to routine anesthesia on patient-reported QoR-15, at 6 hours after surgery in patients having VATS lung resection. Nevertheless, we found our opioid-sparing anesthesia improved patients’ quality of recovery at 24 hours after surgery. The protocols of our opioid-sparing anesthesia provided reduced OBAS score, optimal acute pain control and better clinical recovery during the postoperative period. New approaches need incorporate multidiscipline efforts to fasten patients’ postoperative recovery.",1
"Conclusion
In conclusion, apigenin could protect BBB by reducing the activity of MMPs through oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune response. Multiple pathways may be involved, including JAK/STAT, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and Nitrogen metabolism signaling pathways. BBB permeability is not only an important target for HT prevention after IS and rtPA therapy. It is equally important in neurological diseases such as alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and parkinson, etc. Inexpensive apigenin from natural products has a multi-target, multi-pathway advantage in protecting BBB. However, all evidence for the protective effects of apigenin against IS are in animals, cellular experiments, and computational (in silico) methods. The efficacy and safety of apigenin in patients with IS and the adverse interactions with other drugs need to be verified in more experiments in the future. Despite these problems, apigenin remains a drug with the potential to reduce rtPA therapy side effects and treat IS.",1
"Conclusion
In summary, our results show that exosomes are efficient tools for gene drug delivery
to the ischemic cortex. In addition, exosomes loaded with miR-30d-5p can reverse ischemiainduced, autophagy-mediated brain injury by promoting M2 microglial/macrophage
polarization. Our study suggests that treatment with exosomes from miR-30d-5poverexpressing ADSCs during the acute phase of stroke could be a promising therapeutic
strategy for ameliorating cerebral injury by inhibiting the inflammatory response.",1
"In conclusion, we have identified a direct regulatory connection between Fru1,6bisP in glycolysis and the Ras proteins, that seems to be evolutionary conserved in yeast and mammalian cells. It is responsible for induction of apoptosis in yeast cells with overactive influx of glucose into glycolysis and stalled flux at the level of GAPDH. We suggest that Fru1,6bisP activation of Ras constitutes a key mechanism through which the Warburg effect might stimulate oncogenic potency.",1
"4. Conclusions
The use of electronic appliances and its impact in built environment is receiving considerable attention in recent years. This study aimed to present a novel perspective that will help to understand the linkages that connect the IEQ and EMF exposure in buildings. Hence, this work included different building environments (conventional as well as green buildings) to study and develop a novel approach. Study results summarized that relatively lower EMF emission intensity was found in office premises and comparatively higher power density values were found in hospitals. Moreover, green building assessment resulted in high EMF emission that indicated the significance of this novel approach to examine and thereby reducing the EMF radiation propagation. Examination of different building materials revealed that materials such as ceramic faced lumber, drywall, tile-faced drywall, and masonry or plain faced concrete showed high shielding effect while glass and plain lumber wall showed the opposite. Therefore, this study highly recommended the design of sensitive areas in building’s with drywall or ceramic or plain/masonry faced concrete walls. Also, this study listed some strategies to improve IEQ including utilization of proper shielding materials, maintaining exposure distance along with exposure duration reduction.",1

Summarily, coffee drinking was significantly associated with higher HDL in women but not men after adjustments were made for confounders including rs1800588 (LIPC) and rs1800775 (CETP) single nucleotide polymorphisms. Therefore, coffee drinking might be cardioprotective especially in women.",1
"In conclusion, this study provides evidence that in the post-KAS era, racial disparities in waitlisting persist between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White patients and these disparities are greatest in younger adults. Determining the reasons for greater disparities in waitlisting between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White patients, especially among the younger patients who experienced greater disparities, can help to inform future interventions and policies to improve equity in access to transplantation.",1
"4 Conclusion
The effects of realistic MRI magnetic fields from two different sources (the main magnet and the gradient coils) on monoenergetic proton pencil beams were studied by computer simulations for a hybrid device based on the Alberta 0.5 T rotating biplanar MR radiotherapy design in the parallel configuration. The results of the analytic simulations agreed well with the MC results, differing by less than 0.025 mm at the center of the magnet. Both sources of magnetic fields caused deflections in the proton beam trajectories. In the presence of the static B0 fields, the proton beams studied followed a helical path through the imaging volume with average angular rotation at the center of the magnet of 4.9°, 3.6°, and 2.8° for the 80, 150, and 250 MeV monoenergetic proton beams studied, respectively. The beam rotations observed in this work can become an issue for consideration near the outer edge of the MRI's FOV where the proton beam deflections are amplified. This effect is dependent on the design of the imager and will be static. A solution to resolve this effect is to precalculate the proton beam's trajectory and adjust its source direction accordingly.

The magnetic deflections in the beam trajectories caused by gradient coils’ magnetic fields resulted in a blurring effect applied to the PSF of the proton pencil beams used in this investigation. For an 80 MeV beam, the spread in the PSF was 1.5 mm for the bSSFP40 and 0.77 mm for bSSFP20. Our results indicated that the amount of spread seen in the PSF due to the use of imaging gradients will be linearly dependent on the maximum intensity of the Gx and Gy gradient fields required by a sequence. However, results also show that the extent of these deflections can be greatly reduced by the shielding effects of the MR's steel structures on the gradient coil fields outside the imaging volume. In addition, the difference maps in Fig. 14 show the impact of the gradient fields on the clinical beam's entrance dose become less significant the wider the beam. Therefore, for a common clinical beam width (σ = 3 mm), the gradient fields are expected to have no clinical dosimetry implications for MR imaging sequence and proton MRI setup that was studied.

"Conclusion
Our study shows there is a boom in the use of PROMs for upper limb surgery research, and with this carries the risk of overexpansion of the field of PROMs. Our concern with this is the possibility of creation of more data that lack direct comparability to that of the rest of the scientific community. Published reviews of PROMs in the literature are commensurate with our findings in terms of the increasing prevalence of, and diversity of PROMs systems being used in upper limb surgery. We found that there was a paucity of clinician reporting for the PROMs systems used, with a much higher proportion of PROMs used that were patient-reported only. There is a continental preference for the ASES score in North America and Asia, and a preference for the Constant Score in Europe, which may be related to historical requirements for the use of this score in European institutions. Despite there being a clear preference for the ASES, Constant, and VAS scores, these measures are relatively blunt instruments which do not take into account patient satisfaction or psychosocial factors.
For future studies we cannot recommend that the most commonly used PROMs be reproduced for any given shoulder surgery study. Each clinical study involving shoulder surgery will need to answer specific questions, and it is advisable to use the full scope of the PROMs resources to find the best PROM to sensitively detect the differences in outcomes that are hypothesized. Once this condition has been met, if there is further choice, it is preferable to use PROMs which are validated and can be used to add directly comparable results to the canon of upper limb surgery literature.",1
"In conclusion, this analysis of more than 5 million IRIS
Registry patients indicates an acute-onset endophthalmitis
incidence of 0.04% after cataract surgery based on data from
2013 through 2017 that captures real-world practice among
United States ophthalmologists. Similar to prior studies, a
higher incidence was found among patients undergoing
cataract surgery combined with other ocular surgeries,
among those who underwent anterior vitrectomy, and
among patients younger than 45 years. Importantly, visual
acuity outcomes seem to vary, with many patients ending up
legally blind; nevertheless, patients can recover excellent
vision after surgery (44% achieving driving-level vision of
20/40 or better). This is valuable information for counseling
patients. However, the full potential of IRIS Registry data to

"5. Conclusions
In this study, we proposed modifications to ApEn and SampEn called 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝐸𝑛𝐴
 and 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝐸𝑛𝐵
, respectively. We showed that these new signal complexity measures, compared with ApEn and SampEn, are more sensitive to self-similarity in the data and more robust to changes in signal amplitude. Additionally, they do not need any signal amplitude correction. We showed, in an exemplary application, that signal entropies can differentiate between normal and epileptic brain states using EEG signals. Given the high interest accorded to ApEn and SampEn in different scientific areas (more than 4000 citations each since being introduced), we believe that our present study has targeted a significant problem by addressing some of their important practical limitations.",1

"We identified 28 MDD-related genes and constructed a weighted
gene co-expression network of MDD. A significant module that had a
negative relation with MDD was obtained by WGCNA and was selected
for detailed analysis. The genes in the selected module were used to
construct a PPI network and were significantly enriched in 10 KEGG

GNGT1, JUN, EGR1, CCL4) in the PPI network with high degree values

in MDD was constructed and used to identify the top 10 genes, which
included three hub genes, six lncRNAs, and one miRNA according the
degree value in the regulatory network. Five of these genes have been
associated with MDD previously, whereas the other five need further

and related mechanisms of MDD, as well as for the mining of diagnostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets of MDD.",1

"Conclusions
CSF-VDRL is highly specific but insensitive as a widely used diagnostic method. When CSF-VDRL is nonreactive, some other indicators should be considered. In our study, neurological symptoms, CSF TPPA titer, CSF protein, CSF WBC were identified as independent predictors of neurosyphilis. Especially, CSF TPPA had high sensitivity, specificity and AUC. Therefore, we suggested that CSF TPPA should be considered as an alternative test for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Combining with neurological symptoms, CSF protein, CSF WBC, the diagnosis would have a higher sensitivity.

"Conclusion
By adopting a computational psychiatry approach [61–65] to data from an inference task with a social component, we show that BPD patients exhibit an aberrant pattern of learning rate adjustment when the environment becomes more volatile. Instead of quickly relearning changed contingencies, they show exaggerated volatility learning. While SCZ and MDD patients showed a tendency to the same pattern, they did not significantly differ from controls in this respect. We also show that BPD and SCZ patients rely more strongly than controls on social-domain beliefs relative to non-social-domain beliefs when making decisions even in a task where doing the opposite would have given them an advantage. Taken together, this shows that there are computational commonalities as well as differences between patient groups, which suggests some underlying mechanisms that may be shared across diagnoses. Since this approach allows for individually quantifying the severity of impairment at a mechanistic level, it has the potential to lead to diagnostic and prognostic advances. Furthermore, it points the way to possible targets for novel interventions which transcend traditional diagnostic boundaries.",1
"Conclusion
A practice team-based intervention (CBT and case management) for primary care patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia may have had a lasting impact regarding anxiety severity despite the challenging context of the Covid-19 pandemic. CBT strategies which patients can apply on their own after termination of treatment (e.g. exposure therapy, behavioural activation, reduction of avoidance behaviour) seem to be a promising strategy for promoting long-term success. However, other factors may have also helped with coping, and therefore, it is unclear to what extent the intervention still played a role in participants’ lives. Additionally, the increase in anxiety and depression symptoms in both groups over time could be attributed to external circumstances, highlighting the need for further research to better understand the impact of the pandemic on mental health.",1
"Conclusion
Early detection strategies for dengue virus outbreaks have considerable impact on the well being of the community. The presented prediction using the seasonal and climate models in this research are very promising. Both models statistically and visually followed the dynamics of the recent and past outbreaks, demonstrating accuracy and reliability and included high variability in the measured parameters. Early detection models that consider pre-outbreak susceptibility measures, in combination with climate variability, provide a reasonable explanation for the 2019–2020 dengue epidemic in Singapore and Honduras, and may serve as a viable predictive tool for future outbreaks in these nations. Future plans should be implemented that focus on improving rapid seroprevalence testing in countries. Regions in non-tropical areas may rely more on the presented seasonal models, as their climate conditions tend to not be optimal for mosquitoes. Small fluctuations in the climate can enhance mosquito breeding. Along with global warming, all countries may soon need to shift their focus towards a climate model-including the United States.",1

"5 Conclusions
This review has shown that available data on the efficacy of ACTs, in particular ASAQ and AL, two first-line antimalarial drugs adopted by the Cameroonian national drug policy, are inadequate. Based on the available evidence, our findings revealed the high efficacy and safety of both ASAQ and AL in the PP population, and support the continued use of these drugs in Cameroon. Information generated from this review of surveillance data will be relevant to national and international authorities for policy formulation and changes. Regular clinical assessment of WHO-recommended ACTs in sentinel sites, together with molecular analysis of relevant markers [Kelch 13, P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt)], is required to monitor parasite sensitivity to ACT, and consolidate and improve evidence-based national antimalarial drug policies.

"The present study has several limitations that should be pointed out. First, it was not possible to conclude whether changes in gene expression were the cause or consequence of the complex physiological environment in patients with type 2 DM. Furthermore, the sample size of EPCs was relatively small (n=4 for each group). Third, due to the lack of a sorting machine, the EPCs in the present study were isolated and cultured in culture dishes. EPCs isolated from the patients in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital were cultured in vitro while CD34+ cells were directly sorted in GSE43950. Therefore, the fold changes of identified hub genes may not fit well with the predicted outcomes of microarrays in GSE43950. Finally, as the clinical traits in the dataset GSE43950 were limited, the exact clinical characteristics of these patients were not known. In the current, the probes were annotated using the platform annotation file, which was last updated in July 09, 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL10379).

"CONCLUSION
It would appear that in principle, any more or less hydrophobic cationic
dye could be used to in fact measure the real PMP difference in yeast; results
point to thioflavin T as the best dye for that purpose. It should be made clear
that the dye used in the previously reported experiments (Calahorra et al.
2017a, b; Peña et al. 2017) was not acridine yellow, but thioflavin T
(Calahorra et al. 2019).
The use of thioflavin T allowed the best approximation to the estimation
by fluorescence and measurement by its accumulation, of the PMP in S.
cerevisiae. Results also show that neither the fluorescence changes nor the
simple accumulation values under different conditions can be taken as such
without considering the uptake of the dye by the mitochondria and its
binding due to both its hydrophobic and cationic nature. Already the
fluorescence changes observed indicate that a large proportion of the dye
was accumulated by the mitochondria, and a low concentration of CCCP (10
to 20 μM) is enough to deenergize the mitochondria without an effect on the
plasma membrane of yeast (Peña 1975). This fortunate situation allows
eliminating the participation of the mitochondria. This conception was
supported by the observation of the fluorescence images that clearly showed 
Estimations and Actual Measurements … 99
that with glucose alone, although the cells captured a large proportion of the
dye, it was located largely in the mitochondria, and fluorescence was faint
because the high accumulation resulted in quenching. Also from the
microscope images it could be concluded that after permeabilizing the cells
with chitosan (not shown) an important portion of the dye remained inside
imputable to its hydrophobic and cationic characteristics.
From these arguments, it was obvious that by permeabilizing the cells
with chitosan, the total amount of bound dye within the cells could be
measured. But not only this, also in the cells permeabilized with chitosan,
adding a large enough concentration of KCl (200 mM), the dye bound to
anionic sites could be displaced, remaining only that bound to hydrophobic
molecules; then, by difference the cationic binding could be obtained. In this
way the concentration values obtained with glucose plus CCCP could be
corrected by subtracting from the total accumulated. In the case of the cells
incubated with 10 mM KCl the situation is the reverse: the uptake of K+
results in an internal dye concentration decrease not only owed to the
decrease of the PMP by the entrance of positive charges, but also because it
results in an accumulation of around or more than 200 mM of the cation,
which displaces the dye from its binding to anionic sites. By the procedure
described, the amount and concentration of the dye displaced by K+ when in
intact cells 10 mM KCl was added could be obtained; then this concentration
of the dye could be added to that found in intact cells incubated in the
presence of KCl (with CCCP). These correction factors can be obtained with
enough approximation and used to calculate the real PMP values. It is
important to remark that all values of the PMP require the presence of 10 to
20 μM CCCP to eliminate the additional and very large accumulation of the
dye by the mitochondria.
The results obtained are higher than those reported by other authors
(Vacata et al. 1981); (De la Peña et al. 1982), and definitely much higher
than those proposed by (Plášek et al. 2012) and (Plášek and Gášková 2014).
The two latter reports also have a problem, they assume that the PMP of
yeast is collapsed by a low concentration (10 μM) of either CCCP or FCCP,
which as mentioned is not enough to increase the H+
conductivity of the
plasma membrane of yeast. This also can be confirmed by the experiments 
100 Antonio Peña, Norma Silvia Sánchez and Martha Calahorra
shown in Figure 5, in which it is clear that CCCP at the concentration used
(10 μM) did not affect the uptake, neither increased the K+
efflux, that would
be expected if the uncoupler at that concentration affected the PMP.
With the corrected values, values were lower in the presence of KCl
(Table 2), but the decrease was perhaps not so large as expected from the
fluorescence changes. This can be explained because although in the
presence of K+
, a large decrease of PMP would be expected, former studies
(Peña et al. 1969; Peña 1975) showed that the addition of the cation
immediately results in an increase of the H+ pumping by the H+
-ATPase of
the plasma membrane. Then this expenditure of ATP produces an increase
of ADP which is responsible for the acceleration of glycolysis (and
respiration), and by that the ATP levels are recovered. It is so that the H+
-
ATPase activity, supported by an increased rate of glycolysis can maintain
the PMP values not much lower than those present in the absence of K+
. In
the mentioned studies it was found that in fact, glycolysis is accelerated in
the presence of potassium, but also that the acceleration persists after K+ has
been taken up by the cells, probably because energy is necessary not only to
capture the cation; after this happens, a new equilibrium is established
between its uptake and efflux, due to the high concentrations reached inside.
In fact, Rothstein and Bruce (1958) described that after K+ has been taken
up by yeast a steady state is established in which an efflux-influx equilibrium
takes place, that not surprisingly, is accompanied by the partial recovery of
the PMP at the expense of an accelerated glycolysis. It is so that the H+
-
ATPase activity, supported by an increased rate of glycolysis can maintain
the PMP values not much lower than those present in the absence of K+
.
Using a similar procedure; i.e., with the correction factors, DiSC3(3), the
least hydrophobic of the cyanines, produced results not far different from
those with thioflavin T, even though it binds inside with a large affinity
because of its hydrophobicity. On the other hand, using 200 μM safranin O,
rhodamine 6G and neutral red, for some reason, values obtained in the
presence of CCCP were lower than those obtained with thioflavin T. Also,
we cannot explain why values after adding KCl were higher than in its
absence Another dye used before is ethidium bromide, but it has a problem, it
appears to be transported by the same carrier as K+
(Peña and Ramírez 1975).
It seems that even small variations in structure make some dyes unsuitable,
even for the qualitative estimation of the PMP.
All previous results reported regarding the quantitative value of the PMP
in yeast cells are probably wrong because they did not consider the internal
binding of the agents used under different conditions.
In summary, the studies performed allow to propose the use of thioflavin
T to estimate by fluorescence, and measure by its corrected accumulation,
the actual PMP values of yeast cells",1

"DIscussion and conclusions
This scoping review explored what is known about
the use of menstruation and fertility tracking apps.
The number of such apps is large, they are growing,
and they are increasingly popular. There is enormous
variation in the types of apps38 available, ranging from
very simple diaries through to apps that use complex,
sometimes proprietary, algorithms to determine ovulation and fertility windows. A survey of 1000 women
indicates that nearly 80% of women intend to use a
fertility tracker app in the future.35
The review has a number of limitations that may
reduce its usefulness. For example, given our resources,
it was only possible to include studies published in the
English language. Our particular search terms and
other delimiters may also have inadvertently excluded
other materials that may otherwise have been included.
The disciplinary and methodological heterogeneity of
papers means that comparing the different studies is
complex and it is challenging to apply quality assessment criteria to studies that are so varied.
This review highlighted how women are motivated
to use menstruation and fertility tracking apps for a
range of reasons but that their motivations and goals
shift over time and can overlap. Previous research
highlighted the complexities of both defining pregnancy intention and women’s experiences of reproduction.39 Existing apps do not necessarily take into
account the way in which women use such apps and
human–computer interaction researchers highlight
the importance of involving users in their design and
development.40 41 This is especially important because
the user is considered to be the single greatest ‘risk
factor’ in the accuracy of apps, and this is particularly
significant if women are seeking to prevent, or plan, a
pregnancy.37
The evidence suggests that women value apps that
are accurate and based on scientific evidence regardless of whether they are relying on the app to predict
their fertile window or not.21 There is limited research
on apps that specifically support pregnancy planning
but the evidence that does exist suggests that popular
apps which contain information on planning a pregnancy are not always accurate, which could be very
misleading for women and couples that are trying for
a baby.29
The review highlights a growing evidence base on
apps marketed to prevent pregnancy with evidence
suggesting that some apps are useful for women who
do not want to rely on hormonal methods of contraception or do not want to use condoms.16–19 31 However,
not all apps accurately predict the fertile window and
women may be using apps for pregnancy prevention
that have not been designed for this purpose.36 Given
this issue and the fact that fertility apps are used fluidly
over time, this poses the potential risk of unintended
pregnancy.
While there are many apps available for download
there is little discussion surrounding the regulation of
fertility and menstruation apps. Guidance is available
for both app developers and individuals seeking to
receive approval via the FDA42 43 for Mobile Medical
Application (MMA). The FDA have approved many
different types of MMAs for use across different health
disciplines42 43 but, as noted earlier, NaturalCycles17–19
is the only app to have been granted approval as a
contraceptive,44 45 and the DaysyView app supports the
class I medical device Daysy.31 The recently published
Joint BASHH/FSRH Standard for Online and Remote
Providers of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services
may be useful going forward.46
The limited evidence base that exists within this field
means there is considerable scope for future research.
As demonstrated across the various studies, there is
a need for further prospective independent research
free from commercial interests and risk. Consequently,
it is important that future research involve users that
reflect ethnic, cultural and geographical diversity, as
well as differences across the life course. The role of
menstruation and fertility tracker apps in developing
countries is also significantly under-researched. The
involvement of fertility specialists and other health
professionals should also be an important aspect of
future research and development in this field.

"Conclusion
Many systemic and cellular immune abnormalities have been found in individuals with ASD. Our study shows significant higher frequencies of circulating mDCs and pDCs populations in autistic children. These increased frequencies were associated with significantly positive correlations with the severity of ASD and some of the behavioral core manifestations of ASD. We found significant inverse relationships between serum 25-OHD levels and the frequencies of mDCs and pDCs populations in children with ASD. Our data suggested that DCs could play a role in the clinical course of ASD. The relationship of DCs to immune disorders in ASD children remains to be determined. Further longitudinal study with a larger sample size is warranted to explore the mechanisms and functions of DCs in ASD patients.

"3.6. Conclusions
Multiple cycles of freeze–thaw treatment followed by osmotic pressure and ethanol stress shock selection produced the robust yeast strain YF10-5, which exhibits improved osmotolerance, ethanol tolerance, and fermentation capacity during VHG fermentation compared to those of the parent strain. Furthermore, YF10-5 exhibited upregulation of three genes encoding HSPs (HSP26, HSP30, and HSP104) involved in the stress response, one gene (TPS1) involved in the synthesis of trehalose, and three genes (ADH1, HXK1, and PFK1) involved in ethanol metabolism, as well as increased intracellular trehalose accumulation. YF10-5 showed significantly improved fermentation performance during VHG-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with sweet potato mash, producing 13.40% (w/v) ethanol. Thus, this strain has potential for VHG bioethanol production.",1

"7. Conclusions
The first data obtained in the SLL confirm the early peopling of the
northwest Amazon basin during the end of the Ice Age and that at this
time this great biome was not a natural barrier for expansion of huntergatherers in South America. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the oldest
occupations occurred starting around 12,600 years before the present
and that the area was occupied throughout the Holocene. As a preliminary hypothesis, we propose an Andean origin for the first humans
in the SLL, if we take into account the geographical proximity of the
Colombian Andes, radiocarbon dates, similarities in lithic technology
and the natural routes (rivers and valleys) connecting the highlands and
lowlands. Similarities in rock art between SLL and Chiribiquete suggest
the creation of a cultural landscape that involves wider cultural interaction.
Our preliminary results (lithic tools, ecofacts and pictographs)
suggest a generalist subsistence strategy, combining hunting and the
consumption of tree fruits. Unlike other regions, for the moment we
have no evidence of the use of roots or wild crops, although a strategy
that involved a degree of forest management does appear likely. A
possibility that requires further exploration, is the presence of megafauna in the SLL, with implications for paleoecological dynamics and
reconstruction, as well as human subsistence strategies and adaptations.
The extensive rock art not only hints at the coeval presence of humans
and megafauna in the landscape, but also that megaherbivores were a
component of the hunters’ diet, an interaction confirmed in contexts
from the Bogota Plateau. The timing of the colonisation of Amazonia
during the YD presents a compelling context that will be essential to
understand the establishment and long-term biodiversity trajectory of
Amazonia.
Upcoming excavations in the contexts of the project LASTJOURNEY
(ERC_Adv_ ERC_Adv_2018–834514) will bring to light new data to refine these hypotheses.",1

"Discussion
The temporal trends analyzed in this study revealed a decrease in micronutrient deficiencies and an increase in excessive weight and breastfeeding. Reduced regional, maternal schooling level and maternal race/skin color inequalities were observed for stunting, anemia, vitamin A deficiency, exclusive bresatfeeding among children < 6 months, and continued breastfeeding among children 12-23 months from 2006-2019. These changes can be attributed to improved living conditions (partly captured by socioeconomic and demographic indicators examined in this study) and the expansion of public health and feeding and nutrition policies implemented in 2015 29,30,31. It is unknown whether these indicators were even better in 2015 and deteriorated afterward due to the recession, economic austerity measures and dismantling of public policies to guarantee rights that occurred in Brazil from 2016 onwards 12,13. Notably, the scenario for these indicators was better in 2019 than in 2006.

Considering the improvement in living conditions from 2003-2015 and the aforementioned public policies dismantling from 2016 onwards, we hypothesized that the stability of the stunting prevalence among children < 59 months of age might not reveal the evolution dynamics of this outcome and could be concealing the time trend of linear growth in different age groups. This indicator stability seems to result from a better growth profile among children ≥ 24 months of age combined with a worse profile among those 0-23 months of age. For children < 24 months of age, higher mean HAZ was observed in 2006 rather than in 2019, while the opposite was observed for those ≥ 24 months of age 32.

Among the factors that may explain the increase in excessive weight prevalence between 2006 and 2019 is the expressive consumption of ultra-processed foods, which has been reported across various realities in local Brazilian studies 33,34 and in ENANI-2019 itself 35, and has also been associated with adverse outcomes in children 36. Relvas et al. 33 observed a ultra-processed food intake of 43.1% among children 6-12 months of age assisted in primary healthcare units in a city of the São Paulo’s metropolitan region. Pereira et al. 34 demonstrated a high prevalence of regular ultra-processed food consumption by children 24 months of age, namely: 29.6% for instant noodles, 64.4% for sweet biscuits or sandwich cookies, 65.8% for boxed or bottled juice, powdered juice, or boxed coconut water, and 88.3% for yogurt, among other ultra-processed foods. In a systematic review on the impacts of ultra-procesed food consumption on maternal and child health, Oliveira et al. 36 observed that the greater participation of these foods in children’s diets has been associated with increased weight gain, adiposity measures, overweight, early weaning, poor diet quality, metabolic changes, diseases, and consumption of chemicals from materials (plastic, paper, metal, and glass) used in food packaging.

Other concerning results are the prevalence of nonconsumption of fruits or vegetables on the day before the interview (25.7%) and the prevalence of children not reaching the MDD according to ENANI-2019 (38.5%). The best result among dietary quality indicators was observed for the consumption of meat or egg (83.1%), sources of nutrients essential for linear growth, such as proteins, essential fatty acids, vitamin B12, vitamin D, zinc, phosphorus, and selenium 35.

We observed an increase in breastfeeding prevalence indicators from 2006-2019, however, without statistical significance. Promoting, protecting, and supporting breastfeeding are priorities in the Brazilian National Policy for Integral Child Health Care (PNAISC) 37. The relative stabilization of breastfeeding indicators observed may have occurred due to the limitations in the implementation of breastfeeding strategies in primary health care 38 and hospital settings 39 and to the widespread and persistent practice of abusive marketing of foods and products that directly compete with breastfeeding 40,41, violating national marketing regulation laws 42.

A reduction in regional, maternal schooling and maternal race/skin color disparities observed for stunting, anemia, vitamin A deficiency, exclusive breastfeeding among children < 6 months, and continued breastfeeding among children 12-23 months from 2006-2019 suggests that public policies that have contributed to the improvement of the indicators have also reduced the vast inequalities in Brazil. However, these inequalities are not fully mitigated, as regional and sociodemographic differences for these indicators were still observed in 2019 35,43,44. For example, anemia prevalence among children aged 6-59 months decreased from 20.5% in 2006 to 10.1% in 2019, but reached 17% in the North Region, whereas it varied from 7.6% to 11.9% among other regions of Brazil 45. The findings regarding excessive weight converge with what has been recorded in the literature in recent years: a rise in excessive weight at increasingly earlier ages 46, with a more intense increase among children living in higher income and urbanization contexts 47, as is the case of the Southeast and South regions when compared to the others.

The main limitation of this study is the lack of full comparability between some of the PNDS 2006 and ENANI-2019 indicators due to methodological differences. These concern the diet quality, assessment of micronutrient deficiencies, and anthropometry data collection. The methods of measurement of anemia and vitamin A deficiency adopted in PNDS 2006 are not considered the gold standard. Possibly, part of the difference observed between anemia and vitamin A deficiency prevalence in 2006 and 2019 is due to methodological differences. The impossibility of considering prematurity in the PNDS 2006 could lead to an overestimation of stunting. Nonetheless, we reached the conclusion that the stunting prevalence was very similar, comparing results with and without preterm birth, similarly to INTERGROWTH-21st researchers 24. Therefore, it is safe to assume a negligible role of this limitation on the anthropometric estimates.

As a strength of the manuscript, we highlight the methodological procedures adopted to harmonize the two studies’ databases (e.g., standardization of age calculation based on the day of anthropometric assessment and use of the first weight and height measurement to calculate anthropometric indices). Another positive aspect was the use of equiplot charts, which help visualize the evolution of inequalities over time and offer information for greater adequacy of public policies.

The evidence produced by this study points to a challenging scenario for public health. It is necessary to continue strengthening public policies and improving those aimed at promoting adequate and healthy food consumption 48,49 and protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding 37, which still has a prevalence below international targets, e.g., 45.8% exclusive breastfeeding among children < 6 months, while the WHO target for 2030 for this indicator is at least 70% 50.

Regarding anemia and vitamin A deficiency, which showed a significant decline in magnitude, the short-term challenge is the reorientation of programs based on prophylactic micronutrient supplementation aimed at preventing and controlling these diseases. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has undertaken efforts to focus on more vulnerable groups and regions and reformulate some of these programs 51,52.

The most effective measures to overcome stunting are: increasing the purchasing power of the poorest and universalizing the population’s access to essential education, health, and sanitation services 53. As mentioned, evidence indicates that the stability observed for this indicator relies on the combination of a better nutritional status among older children and a worse status among younger children 32. If younger children’s growth profile is maintained, there may be an increase in stunting prevalence in the near future. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated this scenario. An indication of this is the increase in the prevalence, in recent years, of food insecurity in Brazil and its intensification in the pandemic period: from 22.9% in 2013-2014 to 36.7% in 2017-2018, reaching 58.7% in 2021-2022 14,54. Given this, the challenges for public policies aimed at overcoming food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition are of different orders: mitigate the immediate effects of this pandemic and resume, improve, and expand the coverage of public policies to guarantee rights.

Regarding poor-quality diet and excessive weight, there is an urgent need to improve regulatory measures to protect children from exposure to ultra-processed foods supply and marketing communication practices, which are still incipient in Brazil 55. Appropriate measures for this purpose are being implemented in different countries, including regulation of advertising aimed at children, taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, front-of-pack nutrition warning labeling of ultra-processed foods, and regulation of food environments 56. These measures must be articulated with actions that promote health and adequate eating habits in primary health care and schools and with initiatives that favor environments that promote physical activity 48,49,57. Furthermore, they must be articulated with public policies that favor access and consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods 58.

Although the actions to overcome challenges posed by the current feeding and nutritional profile of Brazilian children have been presented as responses for each specific outcome (or set of outcomes), they should articulate and complement each other. Actions that promote, protect and support breastfeeding contribute to increase this practice’s prevalence and prevent stunting and childhood obesity. Access to diversified unprocessed or minimally processed foods contributes to the prevention of obesity, stunting and micronutrient deficiencies. Actions to overcome regional and sociodemographic inequalities benefit all the outcomes addressed here. From this perspective, an additional challenge for public policymakers, researchers, and workers in feeding and nutrition is understanding that all outcomes addressed in this study are not isolated events but different faces of malnutrition 59,60,61.

The set of actions presented involves different public policy sectors at national, state, and municipal levels of administration. Although the health sector is the protagonist of this agenda, these actions are not limited to this sector. It is fundamental to resume the implementation of the Brazilian National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (PNSAN) and the Food and Nutrition Security System (SISAN) 62, which has been interrupted since 2019 63, at the federal level, to enhance the intersectoral articulation that is essential for the implementation of the necessary food and nutrition policies 64.

ENANI-2019 collected data just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which deepened Brazil’s economic recession and social inequalities. The results of the ENANI’s second edition, which is planned for 2024, will allow us to assess this pandemic effects on the feeding and nutrition of children < 5 years old and on regional and sociodemographic inequalities regarding these events. Comparing its results with those of the ENANI-2019 will provide inputs for developing and reformulating public policies about food and nutrition that can respond to the current scenario.",1
"Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is a unique study of TRE in humans who have metabolic syndrome. The high level of adherence to TRE in our study, no reported adverse effects, and low dropout rate suggest that a self-selected 10 h window for TRE may be feasible for patients with metabolic syndrome to adhere to over a longer period of time. The use of a smartphone application to capture real-time data about meal timing and sleep restfulness is a unique tool to monitor and intervene in the circadian aspects of lifestyle and its day-to-day variance. The use of this smartphone app will allow us to design larger studies of TRE in which participants are monitored remotely over even longer periods of time.
This study has demonstrated that a 10 h TRE intervention over 12 weeks, without an overt attempt to change physical activity or diet quality or quantity, can serve as a novel treatment for individuals with metabolic syndrome. Importantly, we observed significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C. These findings occurred without increased physical activity, and there was no significant correlation with changes in weight (Table S3). However, a decrease in waist circumference was correlated with change in weight (p = 0.017), a larger correlation with decreased eating interval (p = 0.005), and a combined change in weight and eating interval (p = 0.004) (Table S3). Most participants were already taking stable doses of cardiovascular medications (79% and 63% of patients were taking a statin and anti-hypertensive therapy, respectively; Table S2), suggesting that the observed benefits of TRE were additive to the effects of these medications. Among participants with elevated fasting blood glucose and/or HbA1c, we also observed a significant reduction in HbA1c. In this population at high risk for CVD, a significant reduction in atherogenic lipids, blood pressure, and blood glucose on top of medical therapy has important clinical implications.",1
"5. Conclusions
MC-25-41, a highly selective D3R partial agonist with a long half-life, reduces cocaine-motivated behaviors on high and low-effort schedules and may have an impact on reward efficacy. Furthermore, the analysis of MC-25-41 pharmacological effects using a behavioral economics framework is a novel approach for evaluating pharmacotherapeutics targeting the dopamine system. This approach identified effects on motivation, specifically an increase in demand elasticity, missed by traditional analysis of cocaine self-administration dose-response data. These findings together with the promising pharmacokinetic properties of MC-25-41 suggest it may be a useful pre-clinical candidate for the treatment of CUD.",1

5.1. Discussion and Implications
In this study, we discovered about the relationship between perceived risk, perceived benefit, initial use intention, and repeat use intention of biometric security procedures at airports. The fundamental overarching philosophy of implementing biometric security technology is to acquire both enhanced aviation security and passenger facilitation for sustainable airport management. However, there still exist some field practitioners at airports who just would like to adopt the innovative technology to follow the trend or to keep up with the competition with market-leading airports without a profound understanding of passengers’ insight. This unconcerned attitude of airport operators could harm not only the successful adoption of the service but also sustainable airport management. Therefore, this research raised the alarm over such unconcerned attitudes by providing fruitful discussion for airport operators by building an appropriate implementation strategy of biometric security procedures.
The following practical implications were derived to facilitate the deployment of biometric technologies by airport operators. As both passengers’ perceived benefits and perceived risks are found to have significant impacts on passenger’s initial and repeat use intention of biometrics security, practitioners at airports should consider this fact for creating value and mitigating the risk of using the service. The perceived benefit was revealed as a component that impacts on both passengers’ use intentions of biometric security services. Providing the value of products and services to users is one of the essential activities for firms, and this research also discovered a similar finding. For instance, airports could advertise the beneficial points of biometric security processes to passengers, such as not needing to face security agents that would significantly decrease the possibility of disease infection (i.e., COVID-19)
The most important implication of this study was that perceived risk had a relatively more substantial influence on both initial and repeat use intention than perceived benefit. This result emphasized that the field practitioners at airports should make considerable efforts to eliminate risk factors for guiding passengers to use the service without hesitation. For example, as an opposite approach to the perceived benefit, airport operators should relieve passengers’ anxiety of disease infection (i.e., COVID-19) by frequently sterilizing biometric security devices, to mitigate passengers’ perception of risk factors. Of course, it is crucial to let passengers know that those devices are regularly cleaned using promotional materials. Additionally, providing information about less contact with the security agents as well as probable additional installation of thermal skin temperature for fever detection on the biometric security devices could be articulated to turn passengers’ perceived risks into perceived benefits of using biometric security, especially in this COVID-19 pandemic situation.
Furthermore, this study articulated that the first usage experience was also an imperative element for passengers to use biometric security procedures repeatedly. Since passengers do not choose whether to use biometric security before visiting the airport, offering them an enjoyable experience of using biometric security would have advantages in that passengers would not think adversely of the initial trial. Additionally, as the mediation test results showed, this engaging experience would be aligned with passengers’ perceptions toward benefits and risks. In other words, if passengers perceived more beneficial aspects than non-beneficial aspects during their initial trial, there would be a positive likelihood for a more lucrative result from the implementation of biometric security technology.
5.2. Limitations & Suggestions for Future Studies
Despite the implications as mentioned above, there still are limitations in this study. Firstly, this research only employed self-reported cross-sectional data samples. The self-reported cross-sectional survey could be hypothetically vulnerable to standard method variance [88]. In order to mitigate the bias, obtaining a longitudinal dataset from the third-party measures might need to be implemented. Likewise, the implication of this research would have potentially more profound generalizability with longitudinal datasets that could be applied to not only airports in Korea but also several airports in the world.
Furthermore, even though biometrics could be applied across the whole spectrum of the boarding process performed at airports from the perspective of enhancing operational efficiency for sustainable airport management [7,92], this study just focused on the security procedure. Biometric technologies could mitigate laborious tasks of presenting identification documents and flight tickets at each of the airport scenes in the same manner as at the security checkpoint. However, as there are other environmental factors presented by operational circumstances in other various areas of the airport, critiques from passengers may be varied and reflected in their intention to use biometric services based on other operational areas of the airport. In other words, there needs to be more research on the implementation of biometric technologies within the entire airport to contribute to acquiring a more sustainable airport management flow through maximizing aviation security and operational efficiency together. Therefore, future studies need to obtain non-cross-sectional data samples and expand the scope of domains compatible with biometric applications in airports. The implementation of biometrics could be broadened from the pre-boarding process to other serviceable areas of the airport, such as check-in, bag-drop, boarding gate operations, departure and arrival identification procedures, and even duty-free shops as a single token service. Henceforth, if future studies consider longitudinal data samples and a range of compatible applications, more meaningful contributions will be developed that were not derived from this study for more sustainable airport management.",1

"Conclusions
In this study, we associated 15,552,968 imputed whole-genome sequencing markers with mastitis resistance in 5147 Nordic Holstein cattle. After GWAS, we identified 22 independent QTL that collectively explained 14% of the variance in breeding values for resistance to CM. Besides recovery of some QTL from previous reports, we also found new loci associated with mastitis resistance. To prioritize candidate genes post-GWAS, we used multiple source of information including Gene Ontology terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and mammalian phenotype database. To confirm results of gene-based analyses, we used gene expression data from E. coli-challenged cow udders from previous study. For combining different information, we designed a method to gradually add new types of pertinent data. At the end, we suggested putative causal genes with biological relevance for 12 QTL affecting resistance to CM in dairy cattle. This study showed our approach could be widely applied for GWAS in dairy cattle.",1
"5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AITD subjects and that these subjects have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D, suggesting that lower serum vitamin D is related to AITD and the deficiency in vitamin D may plays a role in the development of the disease. Large-sample multi-center randomized controlled trials will help to consolidate whether there is an association between vitamin D and AITD, and consequently give directions as to the beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in those patients.",1
"Finally, it appears that MyPlate
adoption may depend on one's
existing food preferences (and possibly those of children).15 MyPlate
adopters were vegetable enthusiasts
who believed that vegetables improved both the atmosphere of

vegetable preference to be an indicator of cooking ability,20 which may
be more a more fundamental predictor of MyPlate adoption than liking
of any single food group.
One limitation of this research is
that it was based on a sample of

to questions about MyPlate and

was not fully representative of the US

"5. Conclusions
In summary, it was possible to observe that the flavonoids were able to protect the gastric and/or duodenal mucosa against different induction models that mimic the ulcer in men (ethanol, NSAIDs, stress and pyloric ligation), through multiple mechanisms of action such as cytoprotectors (increased mucus), antioxidants (increased activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and GSH levels), immunoregulatory (reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines), antisecretory (reduction in H+) and anti-H. pylori. Thus, they can potentially be used as preventive and complementary drugs or as dietary supplements to prevent the development of peptic ulcer and its episodes of recurrence and/or assist in the traditional treatment of ulcerative lesions. Many products of natural origin, especially composed of plant foods and plants, often referred to as complementary and alternative medicines, such as nutraceuticals and herbal medicines, respectively, have stood out for their therapeutic properties, which can assist in the management of many diseases.",1

The risk of CS increases with increasing maternal age after both induced and spontaneous onset of labor in nulliparous and multiparous women without previous CS. In all age groups, the risk of CS is considerably higher following induced labor. The findings provide a knowledge basis that can help to inform women at term about their average risk of CS associated with induction of labor and help these women in the decision-making process. Women are entitled to be informed of benefits and risks related to the procedure, including risk of CS, when induction of labor is considered.",1

"Conclusion
In the current study, three endophytic fungi were isolated and identified morphologically and genetically as A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus. These endophytic fungi have been shown a powerful source of natural compounds with biological activities. Crude extracts of endophytic A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus have shown promising antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as antifungal activity against unicellular fungi. Likewise, these endophytic fungal compounds revealed antioxidant activity with no cytotoxic effect on normal cell lines. Therefore, these compounds produced by these endophytic fungi may be considered safe and can become alternatives to commercial antimicrobial agents.",1
"In conclusion, in this primary prevention study involving persons at high risk for cardiovascular events, those assigned to an energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, had a lower rate of major cardiovascular events than those assigned to a reduced-fat diet.

"In summary, in this research, the biomechanical properties of Coflex and X-STOP were explored through simulating the degenerated intervertebral disc model using finite element analysis. The results revealed that Coflex and X-STOP devices could retain most of the ROM in surgical segment levels, maintain the stability of lumbar spinal segments, and reduce intradiscal pressure. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in ROM and intradiscal pressure at the adjacent segment levels before and after implantation of Coflex or X-STOP devices, which indicated that the interspinous spacers played an important role in relieving or avoiding the degeneration at the adjacent segment levels. This suggests that Coflex and X-STOP devices had better biomechanical characteristics and could become an effective and alternative method for spinal fusion treatment or conservative therapy. In addition, the model developed in this study can be exploited not only for simulating and analyzing a single implant, but also for comparison among different types and models of implants at a single segment level in future studies.

"4. Conclusions
The lignite insoluble residue (LIR) after extraction of humic acids was used as the catalyst support of Ni, and then Ni/LIR was prepared and
tested for steam reforming of toluene. Ni/LIR has several advantages over metal oxides, such as low cost, combined catalytic activity from
both the inherent mental species and char support, and reduced use of Ni in reforming Nickel particles were highly dispersed with satisfactory loading amount (23.58 wt%) in Ni/LIR by the combined ion exchange and
impregnation method. Ni/LIR has good textural characteristics and plays a significant role in toluene steam reforming, largely increasing
conversion ratio and product gas yields, compared with no catalyst, lignite insoluble residue and the conventional Ni/Al2O3 catalyst.
The experimental results show that under optimum conditions, more than 95% of toluene was converted to syngas by the catalysis of Ni/
LIR. The higher temperature is favorable for toluene conversion, but more char support was consumed by steam gasification. We suggested
catalytic temperature of 900 K and steam/carbon ratio of 2.75e3.5 mol/mol as the conditions for efficient toluene conversion and acceptable
char consumption. Nevertheless, further condition optimization, extended assessment of catalyst lifetime for long run applications, and
reforming of real biomass tar are necessary for the future.",1
"5. Conclusions
Natural crosses between wild species of Oryza with different genomic types are unknown. However natural hybridization is common between wild species of rice and the worldwide cultivated O. sativa. Several evidence indicate that the distribution of the rRNA families in rice species was not a consequence of interspecific hybridization after speciation of the genus Oryza. Nonetheless, the identity of partial LSU rDNA sequences affiliated with different rRNA families from different species is striking. If we consider the long span of genetic isolation after continent separation, the presence of identical rRNA gene sequences in different species appears to be unlikely but could be explained by the exchange of rRNA families through natural species interbreeding.
Conclusively, this study explained that Oryza species have the same ecological origin by molecular clock calculation owing to monocots and monocot lineages, suggesting that the geographical distances of continent-separation cause barriers to the gene flow and homogenization providing future directions of gene flow in Oryza species.",1

"5 Conclusions
From the results of the present study, we can conclude
that: (1) Psorinum 6× therapy has the potential to
interact with the DNA and thereby to hinder the process
of cell proliferation and cell cycle, the hallmark of
cancerous growth; (2) the molecular mechanism involves
accumulation of ROS in A549 cells and thus depolarizes
MMP which initiates cytochrome c discharge into the
cytosol. The actual mechanism of apoptosis also involves
the up- and down-regulations of some relevant signal
proteins: pro- and anti-apoptotic ones. The up-regulation
of p53 can induce apoptosis in the cells by intrinsic
pathways. The activated p53 in turn activates caspase-3
downstream. The alteration in the levels of Bax and
Bcl-2 (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio), downstream of p53, is also a
decisive factor that plays an important role in determining
whether cells will undergo apoptosis leading to cell death.
These events push Psorinum-treated A549 cells towards
apoptosis by altering activities of different cellular
proteins.",1
"VI. CONCLUSION
This study has experimentally demonstrated that the
laser-seeding attack is able to increase the intensity of
the light emitted by the laser diode used in a QKD system, breaking the fundamental assumption about the mean
photon number of a QKD protocol. Moreover, we show
theoretically that such increase of the intensity might seriously compromise the security of QKD implementations.
For this, we consider two prominent examples: the standard decoy-state BB84 protocol and MDI QKD, both
implemented with phase-randomized WCPs. In both cases,
we demonstrate that, in the presence of the attack, the
legitimate users of the system might significantly overestimate the secret key rate provided by proper security
proofs, even well above known upper bounds. This theoretical security analysis can be applied to any attack
that increases the intensity of the emitted pulses. For
instance, a laser-damage attack against the optical attenuators also shows that Eve can increase the intensity of
Alice’s pulses by decreasing the attenuation provided by
the attenuators [24].
Although MDI QKD is immune to all detector sidechannel attacks, our work shows Eve’s capability of hacking the source of a QKD system and highlights that further
research is needed to protect the system against source
side-channel attacks. Moreover, we remark that the laserseeding attack may compromise as well the security of
other quantum decoy-state-based cryptographic systems
beyond QKD, like, for instance, various two-party protocols with practical signals [74], quantum digital signatures
[75,76], and blind quantum computing [77,78].
While preparing this Paper for publication, we learnt of
another laser-seeding experiment that changes the wavelength of Alice’s laser rather than its intensity [59].",1
"Conclusions
Riparian zones in tributary bays of the TGR are generally a source of GHGs. CO2 emission in this kind of zone mainly contributed to the GHG emissions, partly due to the high organic carbon input from the reservoir catchment, and they should be paid more attention in the future research.

Different farming practices likely changed the humidity, carbon and nitrogen of soil. GHG emissions in TGR were affected by soil temperature, soil water content and soil fertility. Riparian zone reclamation lowered CO2 emission, and increased N2O emission. Higher soil VWC led to a higher CH4 emission in paddy fields than in dry lands and grasslands. Anthropogenic activities caused a decrease of soil TC, and the decrease of GHG emission from croplands in the riparian zone. Farming was a main influence (e.g., tillage and fertilization), and caused higher N2O fluxes at 165 m especially. The high N2O fluxes produced from tillage and fertilizer suggest that, in order to potentially mitigate GHG emissions from the riparian zone, farming practices in dry lands at low water levels (below 165 m) should be paid more attention.

Because of the resident farming activities, TGR cropland seemed to have no spatial effect along the elevation gradient. No significant difference of the amplitude of diurnal variations of GHGs in different seasons was found. However, there was a short-term increasing CO2 and decreasing N2O emission, and the diurnal variation amplitude of N2O was also much lower after draining in paddy fields. These spatial–temporal characteristics in paddy fields together with the seasonal water-level fluctuation shall be taken into account in future studies to further explore the underlying mechanisms controlling GHG emission kinetics.",1
"ConclusionVitroScreen  ORA™  intestinal  spheroids represent a new, ethical and advanced micro-physiological  system  suitable  for  pre-clinical studies applied to nutritional ingredients mir-roring both the morphological and biochemical features  of  inflamed  gut  epithelium.  Overall, our preliminary results are encouraging. They demonstrate a protective role of sodium butyr-ate and PEA in gut barrier integrity and suggest the adoption of these nutraceuticals in clinical practice  to  better  manage  pathogenesis  and IBD flare-ups. When taken together, all results pave the way for further investigations to gain a deeper understanding the molecular mech- anism of action of butyrate and PEA alone on intestinal epithelium and the synergic combina-tion of both by a multiparametric approach.",1
"Our finding that MTO moves change the frequency of AAVE
use by youth is consistent with previous observational research in
sociolinguistics showing that lower- and working-class status is
correlated with the highest frequency of AAVE use within the
African-American community (see, for example, ref. 8). Various
studies have shown that the level of income segregation in
American neighborhoods has been increasing since 1970 and
that concentrated poverty (the share of poor families living in
census tracts with poverty rates of 40% or more) has increased as
well, including during the 2000s (42–44). Our findings raise the
possibility that rising U.S. residential economic segregation may
be contributing to growing differences within the population in
AAVE use in a manner that could further exacerbate the economic disadvantages of youth growing up in high-poverty areas.
Although efforts to eliminate discrimination in schools, labor
markets, and criminal justice settings are of critical importance,
policies to reverse the trend toward increased economic segregation may also play a role in shaping black-white inequality in
language and hence in life outcomes.",1
"Is the production of CemA also affected by the mbi1 mutation? In other words, can CemA production be supported by the two polycistronic transcripts #1 and #2, which in the absence of MBI1 are the only transcripts that carry the cemA CDS? In the absence of an antibody and in view of the mild phenotype of the cemA deletion (Rolland et al., 1997), we cannot conclude, but we note, that no monocistronic transcript has ever been detected for this gene, so that a coupling between mRNA stabilization and translation seems less likely.",1
"4. Conclusions
The PAH polymer was synthesized and used as an additive to the
PSF blend membrane. The PSF/PAH blend UF membranes were prepared by the phase inversion method with a different ratio of PAH. The
optimum ratio of PSF/PAH was found to be 85:15 (M-3) with pure water flux of 178 L m−2 h−1
. In addition, the M-3 membrane exhibited
91.5% of Pb2+ and 72.3% of Cd2+ ion removal with feed concentration
of 10 mg/L. The results also revealed that the further increase of the
PAH amount beyond 20% diminished the hydrophilicity, porosity, and
PWF. The porosity of the blend membrane (M-3) was increased to
57.1% compared to the pristine PSF membrane. As a whole, the novel
polymer PAH would be the prospective nominee for improving the
membrane performances.",1
"5. Conclusions
One of the major regulatory mechanisms governing plant senescence is transcriptional reprogramming governed by a high number of different transcription factors. Many of the senescence-regulating transcription factors are themselves induced or repressed on the transcriptional level; however, at some point, several transcription factors have to be regulated on the posttranscriptional level and GBF1 belongs to these factors. One possible regulatory mechanism is the activation or inactivation by phosphorylation by different kinases and CKII appears to be one of the senescence-regulating kinases modulating the DNA-binding activity of GBF1. But how the activity of CKII is controlled during development and onset of senescence and which other kinases are involved in the modulation of GBF1 activity still has to be elucidated.",1
"Conclusions
The findings of this network meta-analysis indicated that MIS and SR exhibit high clinical efficacies, however, these two approaches are correlated with a high number of complications. Ablation is highly effective for small tumors, whereas SBRT is more effective when compared to other ablation treatments in some cases. This indicates that SBRT is a relatively promising treatment for HCC. Subgroup analysis indicated that further studies should explore indications for different treatments. Moreover, well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials should be conducted to validate the findings of this study.

"Conclusion
This study elucidated the correlation between high expression of UBE2T and malignant characteristics of CRC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that UBE2T could promote the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo through ubiquitination and degradation of p53. We clarified the high-expression of UBE2T as one of the molecular diagnosis markers and prognostic indicators of CRC patients. UBE2T also has the potential to be explored as a therapeutic target for CRC in future.",1
