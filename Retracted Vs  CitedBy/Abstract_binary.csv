"It has been suggested that drugs combining activities of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor agonist
may form a novel strategy for higher therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant. The present study aimed to examine the
pharmacology of YL-0919, a novel synthetic compound with combined high affinity and selectivity for serotonin transporter
and 5-HT1A receptors. We performed in vitro binding and function assays and in vivo behavioral tests to assess the
pharmacological properties and antidepressant-like efficacy of YL-0919. YL-0919 displayed high affinity in vitro to both 5-
HT1A receptor and 5-HT transporter prepared from rat cortical tissue. It exerted an inhibitory effect on forskolin-stimulated
cAMP formation and potently inhibited 5-HT uptake in both rat cortical synaptosomes and recombinant cells. After acute
p.o. administration, very low doses of YL-0919 reduced the immobility time in tail suspension test and forced swimming test
in mice and rats, with no significant effect on locomotor activity in open field test. Furthermore, WAY-100635 (a selective 5-
HT1A receptor antagonist, 0.3 mg/kg) significantly blocked the effect of YL-0919 in tail suspension test and forced swimming
test. In addition, chronic YL-0919 treatment significantly reversed the depressive-like behaviors in chronically stressed rats.
These findings suggest that YL-0919, a novel structure compound, exerts dual effect on the serotonergic system, as both 5-
HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT uptake blocker, showing remarkable antidepressant effects in animal models. Therefore, YL0919 may be used as a new option for the treatment of major depressive disorder.",0
"Background A negative impact of premature birth on health in adulthood is well established. However, it is not clear whether healthy adults who were born prematurely but have similar physical activity levels compared to adults born at term have a reduced maximal aerobic exercise capacity (maximum oxygen consumption [VO2max]). Objective We aimed to determine the efect of premature birth on aerobic exercise capacity and lung function in otherwise healthy, physically active individuals. Methods A broad literature search was conducted in the PubMed database. Search terms included ‘preterm/premature birth’ and ‘aerobic exercise capacity’. Maximal oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) was the main variable required for inclusion, and amongst those investigations forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, % predicted) was evaluated as a secondary parameter. For the systematic review, 29 eligible articles were identifed. Importantly, for the meta-analysis, only studies which reported similar activity levels between healthy controls and the preterm group/s were included, resulting in 11 articles for the VO2max analysis (total n=688, n=333 preterm and n=355 controls) and six articles for the FEV1 analysis (total n=296, n=147 preterm and n=149 controls). Data were analysed using Review Manager ( Review Manager. RevMan version 5.4 software. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2020.). Results The systematic review highlighted the broad biological impact of premature birth. While the current literature tends to suggest that there may be a negative impact of premature birth on both VO2max and FEV1, several studies did not control for the potential infuence of difering physical activity levels between study groups, thus justifying a focused meta-analysis of selected studies. Our meta-analysis strongly suggests that prematurely born humans who are otherwise healthy do have a reduced VO2max efect: Z=5.32) and FEV1 (mean diference−9.22 [95% confdence interval−13.54,−4.89] % predicted, p<0.0001, test
for overall efect: Z=4.18) independent of physical activity levels.
Conclusions Whilst the current literature contains mixed fndings on the efects of premature birth on VO2max and FEV1,
our focused meta-analysis suggests that even when physical activity levels are similar, there is a clear reduction in VO2max
and FEV1 in adults born prematurely. Therefore, future studies should carefully investigate the underlying determinants of
the reduced VO2max and FEV1 in humans born preterm, and develop strategies to improve their maximal aerobic capacity
and lung function beyond physical activity interventions.",0
"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of people's lives, with many tasks and services now being delivered online in the aim of reducing contact and preventing further transmission of the disease. This has resulted in the increase in the use of portable electronic devices (i.e., mobile phones, smartphones, laptops), which emit different frequencies of electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation. However, the evidence on the harmful impacts of EMF radiation exposure on the human body, particularly on the abdomen of the female body during pregnancy, is scarce. Further, the related studies in the literature have yet to be systematically reviewed. If unmanaged, the absorption of EMF radiation by the maternal abdomen during pregnancy is associated with serious birth and infant outcomes.",0
"Learning to write involves integrating motor production and visual perception to develop orthographic representations. This study tries to test the effect of hand movement training as a pathway to neural correlates for L2 Chinese and L2 English readers. Twenty L2 Chinese and 20 L2 English (n = 20) adults participated in both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments. We designed six learning conditions: Hand Writing Chinese (HC), Viewing Chinese (VC), Drawing followed by Character Recognition in Chinese (DC), Hand Writing English (HE), Viewing English (VE), and Drawing followed by Word Recognition in English (DE). Behavioral and EEG results demonstrated that drawing facilitated visual word recognition in Chinese compared to viewing. The findings imply that hand movement could strengthen the neural processing and improve behavioral performance in Chinese character recognition for L2 Chinese learners and English word recognition for L2 Chinese learners. Furthermore, N170 amplitude at the drawing condition was positively correlated with N400 amplitudes. Thus, the early visual word recognition neural indicator (e.g., N170) was predictive of the late neural indicator of semantic processing (e.g., N400), suggesting that hand movement facilitates the neural correlates between early word recognition and later comprehension.",0
"To study the effect of miRNA‐200b on hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 in mice.
The C59BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups (normal control
[NC], CCLR model [Model], and CCl4 + miRNA‐200b [miRNA]). The hepatic
fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injected subcutaneously twice per week in Model
and miRNA groups. After 6 weeks building model, the mice of miRNA group
were injected the miRNA‐200b from caudal vein twice per week. The mice of
Model and miRNA groups were continuously fed for 3 weeks. The IL‐1β, IL‐6,
and TNF‐α concentrations of serum were measured by enzyme‐linked
immunosorbent assay. The hepatic tissues of difference groups were observed
by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, sirius red staining, Masson staining,
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and
measured toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) proteins
expressions by western blot assay. The correlation between miRNA‐200b and
TLR4 were analyzed by dual luciferase target assay. Compared with NC group,
the interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), IL‐6, and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α)
concentrations of Model group were significantly upregulated (P < 0.05,
respectively). With miRNA‐200b overexpression, the IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐α
concentrations were significantly suppressed (P < 0.05, respectively). The
pathologies were improved by H&E staining, sirius red staining, and Masson
staining; meanwhile, the hepatic cell apoptosis rate was significantly suppressed
(P < 0.05). The TLR4 and NF‐κB protein expressions of miRNA group were
significantly suppressed compared with the Model group (P < 0.05, respectively). By dual luciferase target assay, the TLR4 was a target gene of miRNA‐
200b. The miRNA‐200b upregulation improved hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4
via regulation of TLR4 in vivo",0
"Background
Smoking is widespread at all ages in Saudi society. In addition, complaints of vertigo are common. A key problem is how smoking affects vertigo and, thus, quality of life. Researchers have investigated the association between smoking and vertigo and found that smoking may be a risk factor for vertigo, but this association is not clear. The current study aims to investigate the association between smoking and vertigo.
Materials and methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study from March 2022 to January 2023 to investigate the effect of smoking on vertigo in Saudi Arabia’s adult population.
Results
We found that smokers were more prone to vertigo than non-smokers. In addition, the severity of vertigo increases as the number of cigarettes smoked or the length of time in years that the person has smoked increases.
Conclusion
The findings of the study should inspire more research into the impact of demographic factors on vertigo among smokers.",0

The long-term use of calcium hydroxide, or Ca(OH)2, on dentin has been established in the literature. However, scarce data is available on dentin wettability with Ca(OH)2.
Aim
The present study was conducted to assess the outcomes of Ca(OH)2 use on the wettability of dentin following two and four weeks of using sealers of bioceramic (BC) and Tubli-Seal™ in the root canal.
Methods
In this study, 168 specimens were divided into 12 groups of 14 specimens each and were numbered from G1 to G12. G1-G6 groups were tested with Tubli-Seal. Sterile water irrigation was reserved for G1 for two weeks (14 days) followed by two minutes treatment with 6% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) chemical irrigation and 17% EDTA (10 ml). G2 and G3 were subjected to Ca(OH)2 (0.1 ml of UltraCal) for two weeks followed by 10ml sterile water irrigation for two minutes with chemical irrigation. G4 to G6 were given similar treatment for four weeks. G7-G12 were assessed for BC sealer similarly to G1-G6. Two and four weeks of incubation with sterile water or Ca(OH)2 was done in 100% humidity at 37°C. SEM and EDX were done to evaluate the surface morphology of G1 and G6, and results were formed. 
Results
Significantly smaller contact angles were seen for Tubli-Seal (G1 to G6) compared to BC (G7 to G12) with p
Conclusion
Better dentin wettability is seen with Tubli-seal compared to BC sealer. A smaller contact angle between root canal sealers and dentin is seen in the remaining calcium hydroxide samples. Also, calcium hydroxide can be removed from the polished dentin surface with two minutes of irrigation with 17% EDTA and 6% NaOCl.

"Background Pharmacotherapy provides an option for adults with overweight and obesity to reduce their bodyweight if
lifestyle modifications fail. We summarised the latest evidence for the benefits and harms of weight-lowering drugs.
Methods This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane
Library (CENTRAL) from inception to March 23, 2021, for randomised controlled trials of weight-lowering drugs in
adults with overweight and obesity. We performed frequentist random-effect network meta-analyses to summarise
the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation frameworks
to rate the certainty of evidence, calculate the absolute effects, categorise interventions, and present the findings. The
study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021245678.
Findings 14 605 citations were identified by our search, of which 143 eligible trials enrolled 49 810 participants. Except
for levocarnitine, all drugs lowered bodyweight compared with lifestyle modification alone; all subsequent numbers
refer to comparisons with lifestyle modification. High to moderate certainty evidence established phentermine–
topiramate as the most effective in lowering weight (odds ratio [OR] of ≥5% weight reduction 8·02, 95% CI

"T
he overall effects of electronic cigarettes (ECs) on public health remain disputed, with concerns about EC use
in young people in contrast with the potential of ECs to
help adult smokers quit.1,2 Regarding the function of ECs as
an aid to stopping smoking, ECs can be seen as a form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) that is achieving a wider reach
than traditional NRT products, such as nicotine chewing gum
and nicotine patches. In countrieswhere ECs and NRT are available, smokers tend to use ECs for smoking cessation more
widely.3,4Apart from the wider reach, ameta-analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials of ECs vs NRT conducted to date concluded that ECs were also more effective than NRT, although
further trials are needed.5
Next to NRT, the most extensively tested and most widely
used pharmacological aid to stopping smoking is a partial agonist for α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, varenicline,
which is also more effective than NRT.6 One study compared
varenicline on its own with varenicline combined with ECs, but
the trial was stopped early when only 46 participants were recruited in each study arm, meaning that the study was underpowered to detect a difference.7 To our knowledge, no study
to date has attempted a direct comparison between ECs and
varenicline.
In this article, we report a randomized clinical trial that
compared ECs and varenicline. The trial also included an NRT
arm. The trial was testing whether ECs are superior to NRT and
noninferior to varenicline. The study was conducted in China,
where access to and use of stop-smoking medications, as well
as ECs, are much lower than inWestern countries.8-12This had
the potential advantages of lower expectancy effects and reduced risk of trial arms contamination via use of nonallocated products, an issue that affected a recent UK trial of ECs
vs NRT as treatments for pregnant smokers.1",0
"Digital transformation and green innovation are powerful initiatives to achieve carbon peaking,
carbon neutrality targets and highquality economic development. Using a sample of high energy
consuming listed enterprises from 2012 to 2021, a double fxedefect model is constructed to
verify the efect of green innovation on the carbon emission reduction performance of high energy
consuming enterprises, and digital transformation is used as a moderating variable to analyze the
inner mechanism of green innovation afecting the carbon emission reduction performance of high
energyconsuming enterprises under the efect of digital transformation. The empirical results show
that green innovation can signifcantly improve the carbon emission reduction performance of
energyconsuming enterprises, while digital transformation positively moderates the efect of green
innovation on the carbon emission reduction performance of energyconsuming enterprises. When
considering the industry heterogeneity, the moderation efect of digital transformation is signifcant
in the chemical raw materials and chemical products manufacturing industry and the electricity
and heat production and supply industry, but the petroleum processing and coking and nuclear fuel
processing industry, the nonmetallic mineral products industry, the ferrous metal smelting and rolling
processing industry and the nonferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry are not yet
signifcantly afected by green innovation and digital transformation. The fndings of the study provide
empirical evidence to promote the improvement of carbon emission reduction performance of energy

At the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2020, China solemnly announced that China
would strive to reach peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Te ""double carbon"" target refects
China’s determination to comprehensively implement the concept of green development and promote ecological
civilization1
. Te core of green and low-carbon development is to update and optimise products, processes and
services in line with environmental needs, with a view to allocating and utilising resources efciently, reducing
the damage caused by carbon emissions to the environment and ecology, and providing strong support for China
to achieve the ""double carbon"" target and promote high-quality economic development. What is particularly
noteworthy is that with the acceleration of the new round of technological revolution and industrial change,
digital transformation has become a core driver of new development momentum, an important means to facilitate and promote green development, and a necessary way to achieve the ""double carbon"" target. As the basic
industry of our country, the high energy-consuming industry has made great contribution to the construction
of our country’s industry and infrastructure. But at the same time, it also brings environmental problems that
cannot be ignored. Te most prominent one is ""high pollution, high energy consumption and high material
consumption""2
. Existing research has found that the output value of China’s high-energy-consuming industries
is less than 1/3 of the total industrial output value, but energy consumption, material consumption and waste
emissions account for more than 1/2 of the total industrial emissions3

"Osteosarcopenia, a combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia, is a common condition among older adults. While numerous studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on the treatment of osteoporosis, the pharmacological treatment of osteosarcopenia still lacks evidence. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody, has shown encouraging results for the treatment of osteosarcopenia. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the potential dual role of denosumab as an anti-resorptive agent and for other beneficial muscle-related effects in patients with osteosarcopenia, and to evaluate whether denosumab can be a treatment of choice compared to bisphosphonate.


Methods
 Relevant literature was collated from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The primary outcome was denosumab’s effect on lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD), handgrip strength, and gait speed change. The secondary outcome was the effect of denosumab on appendicular lean mass (ALM). The outcomes were presented as mean difference (MD). A random effects model was used in the analysis to represent the population. The risk of bias was assessed using funnel plots.


Results
 Out of the 3,074 studies found, four full-text studies met the inclusion criteria, including 264 and 244 participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Regarding a primary outcome, our meta-analysis showed that denosumab showed no significant differences in LS BMD and gait speed changes compared to other agents—MD=0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.35 to 0.79; p=0.09 and MD=0.11; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.40; p=0.46, respectively. Denosumab had a significant effect on handgrip strength change compared to standard agents—MD=5.16; 95% CI, 1.38 to 18.94; p=0.007, based on the random effects model.


Conclusions
Denosumab was better than bisphosphonate and placebo in improving muscle strength (handgrip strength). Therefore, denosumab may be favored in individuals with osteosarcopenia to improve muscular performance and reduce fall risk.

METHODS: Using an observational cohort design, the US National Inpatient Sample (2018–2020) was queried for adult
patients with basilar artery occlusion and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) <10 for patients treated with
thrombectomy versus medical management. The primary outcome of routine discharge (to home or self-care) was evaluated
using multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching, adjusted for baseline characteristics, stroke severity,
and treatment with thrombolysis.
RESULTS: Of 17019 with basilar artery occlusion, 5795 patients met the criteria for inclusion criteria for our study, and
880 (15.4%) were treated with endovascular thrombectomy. In the propensity score–matched cohort, 880 patients were
treated with medical management and endovascular thrombectomy, respectively. In multivariable regression, endovascular
thrombectomy was associated with both an increased odds of routine discharge (odds ratio, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.31–2.90];
P=0.001) and a decreased length of hospital stay (B, −0.74 [95% CI, −1.36 to −0.11]; P=0.02) compared with medical
management. In the propensity score matched cohort, endovascular thrombectomy remained associated with greater odds
of routine discharge (2.01 [95% CI, 1.21–3.34]; P=0.007) but no difference in length of hospital stay (B, −0.22 [95% CI,
−0.90 to 0.46]; P=0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine discharge was more common in this representative US cohort of patients with basilar artery occlusion
and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <10 who underwent thrombectomy compared to conventional medical
management. These findings suggest thrombectomy may be associated with better functional outcomes despite lower
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and should be validated in a clinical trial setting.

"Background Dementia and hearing loss are both highly prevalent conditions among older adults. We aimed to
examine the association between hearing aid use and risk of all-cause and cause-specific dementia among middleaged and older-aged adults, and to explore the roles of mediators and moderators in their association.
Methods We used data from the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort study, which recruited adults aged 40–69 years
between 2006 and 2010 across 22 centres in England, Scotland, and Wales. We used Cox proportional hazards models
to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs between self-reported hearing aid use status (hearing loss with or
without hearing aids) at baseline and risk of dementia (all-cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia,
and non-Alzheimer’s disease non-vascular dementia). Dementia diagnoses were ascertained using hospital records
and death-register data. We also analysed the roles of mediators (self-reported social isolation, loneliness, and mood)
and moderators (self-reported education and income, smoking, morbidity, and measured APOE allele status).
Findings After the exclusion of people who did not answer the question on hearing difficulties (n=25081 [5·0%]) and
those with dementia at baseline visit (n=283 [0·1%]), we included 437 704 people in the analyses. Compared with
participants without hearing loss, people with hearing loss without hearing aids had an increased risk of all-cause
dementia (HR 1·42 [95% CI 1·29–1·57]); we found no increased risk in people with hearing loss with hearing
aids (1·04 [0·98–1·10]). The positive association of hearing aid use was observed in all-cause dementia and causespecific dementia subtypes (Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and non-Alzheimer’s disease non-vascular
dementia). The attributable risk proportion of dementia for hearing loss was estimated to be 29·1%. Of the total
association between hearing aid use and all-cause dementia, 1·5% was mediated by reducing social isolation, 2·3% by
reducing loneliness, and 7·1% by reducing depressed mood.
Interpretation In people with hearing loss, hearing aid use is associated with a risk of dementia of a similar level to
that of people without hearing loss. With the postulation that up to 8% of dementia cases could be prevented with
proper hearing loss management, our findings highlight the urgent need to take measures to address hearing loss to
improve cognitive decline.

"Differentiating primary and secondary membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) using
biomarkers for MGN is essential in patients’ diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Although biopsy
has been the primary tool in making the diagnosis, not all patients can withstand it due to its invasive
nature, and it cannot be used to monitor treatment. Hence, there is the need for less invasive or even
non-invasive biomarkers for effective diagnosis, treatment monitoring and prognostication. This
study aimed at providing an alternative way of differentiating primary and secondary MGN using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique for serum and urine biomarkers (M-type
phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A))

"Background: Lesotho has the second-highest HIV prevalence globally at an estimated 23%, with approximately 87% of the
population between 15 and 59 years of age reported to be receiving antiretroviral treatment. There is an urgent need to increase
access to effective ART due to increasing rates of first- and second-line treatment failure. Sustaining successful treatment and limiting
the development of virological failure is essential, hence the need for early detection of increased viral load indicating drug resistance
or rapid progression of viral replication.
Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the proportion of patients with HIV with virological failure and to identify factors
associated with virological failure in two districts of Lesotho.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two districts (Butha-Buthe and Mokhotlong) in Lesotho. Data for all patients
(age ≥15 years) in the viral load (VL) monitoring database with at least two consecutive viral load results between December 2015 and
December 2019 from 22 health facilities were extracted. Descriptive data were presented using tables and figures. Bivariate and
multivariate analyses were performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant association.
Results: Only 4% (n = 913) of the study participants had virological failure. Longer time on treatment >65 months (AOR: 1.85 CI:
1.59–2.15) and being on second-line ART regimen (AOR: 75.23 95% CI: 75.00–99.15) were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with
virological failure.
Conclusion: Virological failure among the study participants is lower compared to other settings. The study identified duration on
treatment, treatment regimen as high risk for virological failure. Targeted interventions should be developed for these high-risk group
individuals, with continuous monitoring of virological response and appropriate drug switching to clients to achieve improved
outcomes.

"OBJECTIVE
To determine changes in household purchases
of drinks and confectionery one year after
implementation of the UK soft drinks industry levy
(SDIL).
DESIGN
Controlled interrupted time series analysis.
PARTICIPANTS
Members of a panel of households reporting their
purchasing on a weekly basis to a market research
company (average weekly number of participants
n=22183), March 2014 to March 2019.
INTERVENTION
A two tiered tax levied on manufacturers of soft drinks,
announced in March 2016 and implemented in April
2018. Drinks with ≥8 g sugar/100 mL (high tier) are
taxed at £0.24/L and drinks with ≥5 to <8 g sugar/100
mL (low tier) are taxed at £0.18/L. Drinks with <5 g
sugar/100 mL (no levy) are not taxed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Absolute and relative differences in the volume of,
and amount of sugar in, soft drinks categories, all
soft drinks combined, alcohol, and confectionery
purchased per household per week one year after
implementation of the SDIL compared with trends
before the announcement of the SDIL.
RESULTS
In March 2019, compared with the counterfactual
estimated from pre-announcement trends, purchased
volume of drinks in the high levy tier decreased by
155 mL (95% confidence interval 240.5 to 69.5 mL)
per household per week, equivalent to 44.3% (95%
confidence interval 59.9% to 28.7%), and sugar
purchased in these drinks decreased by 18.0 g (95%
confidence interval 32.3 to 3.6 g), or 45.9% (68.8%

"Effect of imatinib on rats with spinal cord injury (SCI)
was investigated through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway.
Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into
sham operation group (n=12), model group (n=12), imatinib
group (n=12) and inhibitor group (n=12). The results of
immunohistochemistry showed that in comparison with sham
operation group, the other three groups had overtly increased
positive expression level of Bax and evidently reduced positive
expression level of Bcl-2 (P<0.05). Compared with those in
model group and inhibitor group, the positive expression level
of Bax was distinctly lower, while that of Bcl-2 was notably
increased in imatinib group (P<0.05). According to western
blot analysis, the protein expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1
were obviously higher in the other three groups than those
in sham operation group (P<0.05), and they were remarkably higher in imatinib group than those in model group and
inhibitor group (P<0.05). The results of qPCR assay revealed
that the Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA expression levels were markedly elevated in the other three groups compared with those
in sham operation group (P<0.05). Based on ELISA, the
other three groups exhibited notably raised content of IL-6,
TNF-α, ROS and SOD compared with sham operation group
(P<0.05), and imatinib group displayed remarkably decreased
content of IL-6, TNF-α and ROS and markedly elevated SOD
content in comparison with model group and inhibitor group
(P<0.05). The results of TUNEL assay demonstrated that the
rate of apoptosis was significantly raised in the other three
groups compared with that in sham operation group (P<0.05),
and it declined obviously in imatinib group compared with
that in model group and inhibitor group (P<0.05). Imatinib
inhibits oxidative stress response in SCI rats by activating the
Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus repressing apoptosis and

"Violence against children can cause psychological problems such as post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD). The negative impact of violence on children is psychological and physical
problems and risk of suicide. Nurses have a role to provide comprehensive nursing care such as
cognitive behavior therapy for reducing PTSD symptoms. The purpose of this study was to describe
the methods of cognitive behavior therapy to reduce symptoms of PTSD in children who are victims
of violence. This study used the scoping review method. The databases use for the literature review
in this study were CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus. The keywords used in English were “cognitive
behavioral therapy OR CBT” AND “violence OR abuse” AND “post-traumatic stress disorder OR
PTSD” AND “child OR children”. The inclusion criteria were full text, randomized control trial or
quasi-experimental research design, English language, the sample was children, and the publication
period was for the last 10 years (2013–2022). We found 10 articles discussing CBT intervention on
children who experienced victim abuse to reduce symptoms of PTSD. Most of the articles in this
study used randomized control trial design. Several samples in this study are from the USA. The total
sample was 47–320 respondents. This study showed three methods of CBT, namely psychoeducation,
self-management, and coping strategies. CBT interventions can be carried out face-to-face or online.
The activities carried out by the participants were relaxing, participating in training, counseling,
problem-solving discussions, and therapy to improve sleep quality. Cognitive behavioral therapy is
an intervention that can be carried out to reduce the traumatic impact on child victims of violence by
taking into account the characteristics and development of the children.",0
"Background
Neuroinflammation causes neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Ipriflavone (IP), therapeutic compound to postmenopausal osteoporosis, has limited estrogenic activity and is accounted as AChE inhibitor. The developing of drug delivery systems
to enable drug targeting to specific sites increases the drug therapeutic effect.
Objective
The aim of the present study was to formulate and evaluate ipriflavone loaded albumin
nanoparticles (IP-Np) along with free ipriflavone against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced
neuroinflammation in rats.
Methods
Neuroinflammation was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p) injection of LPS (250 μg/kg rat body
weight) then treatments were conducted with (1) ipriflavone at two doses 50 mg/kg and 5
mg/kg, (2) IP-Np (5 mg ipriflavone/kg) or (3) IP-Np coated with polysorbate 80 (IP-Np-T80)
(5 mg ipriflavone/kg). The alteration of the inflammatory response in male adult Wistar rats’
brain hippocampus was investigated by examining associated indices using biochemical
and molecular analyses.
Results
A significant upsurge in inflammatory mediators and decline in antioxidant status were
observed in LPS-induced rats. In one hand, ipriflavone (50 mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80
ameliorated LPS induced brain hippocampal inflammation where they depreciated the level

"Mitochondrial genome provides useful information about species concerning its evolution and
phylogenetics. We have taken the advantage of high throughput nextgeneration sequencing
technique to sequence the complete mitogenome of Yellowbilled babbler (Turdoides afnis), a
species endemic to Peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Both, referencebased and denovo assemblies
of mitogenome were performed and observed that denovo assembled mitogenome was most
appropriate. The complete mitogenome of yellowbilled babbler (assembled denovo) was 17,672 bp
in length with 53.2% AT composition. Thirteen proteincoding genes along with two rRNAs and
22 tRNAs were detected. The arrangement pattern of these genes was found conserved among
Leiothrichidae family mitogenomes. Duplicated control regions were found in the newly sequenced
mitogenome. Downstream bioinformatics analysis revealed the efect of translational efciency and
purifying selection pressure over thirteen proteincoding genes in yellowbilled babbler mitogenome.
Ka/Ks analysis indicated the highest synonymous substitution rate in the nad6 gene. Evolutionary
analysis revealed the conserved nature of all the proteincoding genes across Leiothrichidae family
mitogenomes. Our limited phylogeny results placed T. afnis in a separate group, a sister group of
Garrulax. Overall, our results provide a useful information for future studies on the evolutionary and
adaptive mechanisms of birds belong to the Leiothrichidae family.",0
"Hepatitis causes hepatic cell injury, regeneration and different levels of fibrogenesis, and severe liver fibrogenesis progresses into cirrhosis with liver dysfunction. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein that is predominantly secreted by hepatocytes during early injury or infection. Nevertheless, the relationship of SAA and development of cirrhosis as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms is largely unknown. Here, we found that macrophages are the major SAA-binding cells in the injured liver.
in vitro
, macrophages treated with SAA exhibited high production of IL-10 but low production of IL-12, as features for M2 macrophages. Moreover, these polarized M2 macrophages by SAA also produced IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa, characteristics for an M2b subtype, rather than an alternative M2a or fibrogenic M2c subtype. In a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl
4
)-induced hepatic fibrogenesis/cirrhosis, anti-SAA sera were used to block the effects of SAA, resulting in increases in the severity of hepatic fibrosis, suggesting an overall anti-fibrogenic effect of SAA. Isolated macrophages from mouse liver showed that anti-SAA appeared to alter the polarization of macrophages from M2b to M2c, suggesting that SAA may induce M2b-like macrophage polarization during liver inflammation, which prevents the liver from fibrogenesis.

The forward and reverse Tab primer sequences are reverse to each other at their 5’ end (Nr and N), whereas their 3’ end sequences are complementary to their respective target nucleic acid sequences. The PSR method was performed at a constant temperature 61 °C–65 °C, yielding a complicated spiral structure. PSR assay was monitored continuously in a real-time turbidimeter instrument or visually detected with the aid of a fluorescent dye (SYBR Greenı), and could be finished within 1 h with a high accumulation of 10

"Peptic ulcer including gastric and duodenal ulcers is a common gastro-intestinal disorder worldwide, associated with a significant
mortality due to bleeding and perforation. Numerous efforts are being exerted to look for natural drugs that lack the potential side
effects but still keep beneficial effects for treatment and/or prevention of gastric ulcer. Pinocembrin (PINO) is a natural flavonoid
retaining anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was conducted to investigate the
protective and therapeutic effects of PINO against indomethacin (INDO)-induced gastric ulcer in rats and the possible underlying
mechanisms. PINO (25 and 50 mg/kg) promoted mucus secretion, decreased ulcer index, and inhibited histopathological changes
induced by INDO. Further investigation of possible mechanisms showed that PINO significantly attenuated INDO-induced
oxidative and inflammatory responses in both doses when administrated before or after ulcer induction. PINO downregulated
mRNA expression level of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) which subsequently inhibited NF-κB activation
and inflammatory cytokine release including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). Additionally,
PINO inhibited apoptotic activity which was confirmed by downregulation of caspase-3 transcription. The current results
demonstrated the promising therapeutic activity of PINO against INDO-induced gastric ulcer due to—at least partly—its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects.

"Purpose Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with regulatory approval in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and refractory diferentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors like sorafenib may cause proteinuria. This study aimed to analyze the efectiveness and safety
of sorafenib in RCC, HCC and DTC patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Methods This retrospective study analyzed integrated data from prospective post-marketing surveillance studies for advanced
RCC, HCC and DTC. Background factors considered to afect patients’ prognosis were balanced by propensity score matching using eGFR cut-of values of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
.
Results In the combined matched population (N=2430), sorafenib was equally efective in patients with lower and higher
eGFR values. Sorafenib had an overall response rate (ORR: complete+partial responses) of 18.9% and a disease control
rate (DCR: complete+partial responses+stable disease) of 67.0%. There were no signifcant diferences between lower
and higher eGFR groups for response rates. Renal function was maintained throughout the 12-month study period in the
combined population and in each indication. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were reported in 91.6% and 58.2% of
propensity score-matched patients, and with no signifcant diferences between lower and higher eGFR groups.
Conclusion The efectiveness and safety of sorafenib were similar in patients with eGFR<60 and≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2
during the 12-month observation period, and without impairing renal function.

"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a glycosylated cell surface receptor for high density lipoproteins (HDL), oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL), and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPLs). Scarb1 is expressed in macrophages and has been shown to have both pro- and anti-atherogenic properties. It has been reported that global deletion of Scarb1 in mice leads to either high or low bone mass and that PC-OxPLs decrease osteoblastogenesis and increase osteoclastogenesis. PC-OxPLs decrease bone mass in 6-month-old mice and are critical pathogenetic factors in the bone loss caused by high fat diet or aging. We have investigated here whether Scarb1 expression in myeloid cells affects bone mass and whether PC-OxPLs exert their anti-osteogenic effects via activation of Scarb1 in macrophages. To this end, we generated mice with deletion of Scarb1 in LysM-Cre expressing cells and found that lack of Scarb1 did not affect bone mass in vivo. These results indicate that Scarb1 expression in cells of the myeloid/osteoclast lineage does not contribute to bone homeostasis. Based on this evidence, and earlier studies of ours showing that Scarb1 expression in osteoblasts does not affect bone mass, we conclude that Scarb1 is not an important mediator of the adverse effects on PC-OxPLs in osteoclasts or osteoblasts in 6-month-old mice.

"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a cell surface receptor for
high density lipoproteins. It also binds oxidized low density lipoproteins and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPL), which adversely affect bone homeostasis. Overexpression of a single chain form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 IgM–a
natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPL–increases trabecular and cortical bone mass in
female and male mice by stimulating bone formation. We have previously reported that
Scarb1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for PC-OxPL in calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells. Additionally, bone marrow- and calvaria-derived osteoblasts from Scarb1
knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating
effects of OxPL. Previous skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice has produced contradictory
results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass but another study reporting low
bone mass. To clarify the role of Scarb1 in osteoblasts, we deleted Scarb1 specifically in
cells of the osteoblast lineage using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. We observed no difference
in bone mineral density measured by DXA in either female or male Osx1-Cre;Scarb1fl/fl
mice compared to wild type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. Additionally,
microCT analysis of 6-month-old females and 7-month-old males did not detect any difference in trabecular or cortical bone mass between genotypes. These results indicate that
expression of Scarb1 in cells of the osteoblast lineage does not play an important role in
bone homeostasis and, therefore, it is not essential for the effects of PC-OxPL on these
cells.",0
"Introduction: The potential teratogenic risk of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is
of widespread concern; however, related evidence is largely absent in humans. This
study aimed to compare the prevalence of congenital malformations between pregnant women with and without TCM exposure.
Material and methods: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study of 17 713
women who participated in a survey on periconceptional TCM exposure. Primary outcome was congenital malformations diagnosed from a survey conducted on the day
42 after delivery.
Results: A total of 16 751 pregnant women with 273 congenital malformations were
included in the analysis. Fetuses exposed to TCM had an increased risk of congenital
malformations compared to those without exposure (odds ratio [OR] 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–4.02) after controlling for potential confounders. There were
significant associations with congenital malformations in women with early pregnant
exposure (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.00–4.20) and for those who received ≥2 TCM formulas
(OR 5.84, 95% CI 1.44–23.65). Pre-pregnancy TCM exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects (OR 12.69; 95% CI 3.01–53.51).
Conclusions: Periconceptional TCM exposure is associated with an increased risk of
congenital malformation. This effect was cumulative and sensitive to periconceptional
age. Therefore, TCM deserves more attention and should be used cautiously for pregnant women and those trying to become pregnant.

"Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and
trigger transcriptional regulation of genes important for islet response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile
Ca2+-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from
human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular Ca2+ signalling, while preserving biological
heterogeneity.
Methods We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mmol/l glucose; (2) 16 mmol/l
glucose and 40 mmol/l KCl to maximally stimulate Ca2+ signalling; and (3) 16 mmol/l glucose, 40 mmol/l KCl and 5 mmol/l
EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) to inhibit Ca2+ signalling, for 1 h. We sequenced 68,650 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted
the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 59,373 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed Ca2+-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each
endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.
Results Based on the number of Ca2+-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of
Ca2+ response. We also showed that polyhormonal clusters expressing both INS and GCG, or both INS and SST, are defined by
Ca2+-regulated genes specific to each cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the
highest number of Ca2+-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucosestimulated insulin secretory function.
Conclusions/interpretation Here we use our large-scale, multi-condition, single-cell dataset to show that human islets have celltype-specific Ca2+-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify
PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of Ca2+-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory
function.

"Background: Most studies addressing non-operative management for acute appendicitis have focused on adults, and there are limited data available for children. We aimed to evaluate the results of successful non-operative management in children with acute uncomplicated appendicitis with our “additional criteria” and find which factors could be affecting the success rate and which cases could be candidates for non-operative management.
        Materials and methods: A total of 54 patients who were diagnosed with acute uncomplicated appendicitis and received non-operative management were re-evaluated retrospectively. Defining uncomplicated appendicitis was based on the duration of symptoms (<24 hours), clinical history, and radiologic findings. The radiologic evaluation was based on ultrasonography and computed tomography. The patients received an intravenous antibiotic combination (sulbactam/ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin) for five days at the hospital; the treatment was completed after 10 days with an oral antibiotic combination (amoxicillin/clavulanate, metronidazole). The cases have a follow-up period of up to two years.
        Results: The mean patient age and follow-up time were 13.0 ± 4 years and 41.6 ± 13 months, respectively. The mean leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and appendix diameter values were 15.48 ± 6.4 × 109/L, 11.79 ± 24.5 mg/dL, and 7.76 ± 1.4 mm on admission, and 6.86 ± 12.4 × 109/L, 4.17 ± 10.3 mg/dL, and 5.82 ± 1.6 mm on the second day, respectively. This decrease in WBC/CRP values and appendix diameter was statistically significant (p < 0.001). None of the patients had an early failure, complication, or adverse event. Recurrent appendicitis occurred in only five cases (9%) that were treated by laparoscopic appendectomy during the follow-up.
        Conclusion: Non-operative management for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children regarding long-term outcomes with our criteria was satisfactory and initial success rates were excellent.

"Motivation: CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been revolutionizing the field of gene editing in recent years. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) enable Cas9 proteins to target specific genomic loci for editing. However, editing efficiency varies between gRNAs. Thus, computational methods were developed to predict editing efficiency for any gRNA of interest. Highthroughput datasets of Cas9 editing efficiencies were produced to train machine-learning models to predict editing efficiency. However, these high-throughput datasets have low correlation with functional and endogenous editing. Another difficulty arises from the fact that functional and endogenous editing efficiency is more difficult to measure, and as a result, functional and endogenous datasets are too small to train accurate machine-learning models on. Results: We developed DeepCRISTL, a deep-learning model to predict the on-target efficiency given a gRNA sequence. DeepCRISTL takes advantage of high-throughput datasets to learn general patterns of gRNA on-target editing efficiency, and then uses transfer learning (TL) to fine-tune the model and fit it to the functional and endogenous prediction task. We pre-trained the DeepCRISTL model on more than 150 000 gRNAs, produced through the DeepHF study as a high-throughput dataset of three Cas9 enzymes. We improved the DeepHF model by multi-task and ensemble techniques and achieved state-of-the-art results over each of the three enzymes: up to 0.89 in Spearman correlation between predicted and measured on-target efficiencies. To fine-tune model weights to predict on-target efficiency of functional or endogenous datasets, we tested several TL approaches, with gradual learning being the overall best performer, both when pre-trained on DeepHF and when pre-trained on CRISPROn, another highthroughput dataset. DeepCRISTL outperformed state-of-the-art methods on all functional and endogenous datasets. Using saliency maps, we identified and compared the important features learned by the model in each dataset. We believe DeepCRISTL will improve prediction performance in many other CRISPR/Cas9 editing contexts by leveraging TL to utilize both high-throughput datasets, and smaller and more biologically relevant datasets, such as functional and endogenous datasets. Availability and implementation: DeepCRISTL is available via github.com/OrensteinLab/DeepCRISTL.

" The allogeneic transplantation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) derived from somatic cells overcomes the limitation of avian cloning. Here, we transdifferentiate chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) from black feathered Langshan chickens to PGCs and transplant them into White Plymouth Rock chicken embryos to produce viable offspring with characteristics inherited from the donor. We express Oct4/Sox2/Nanog/Lin28A (OSNL) to reprogram CEFs to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are further induced to differentiate into PGCs by BMP4/BMP8b/EGF. DNA demethylation, histone acetylation and glycolytic activation elevate the iPSC induction efficiency, while histone acetylation and glycolytic inhibition facilitate PGCs formation. The induced PGCs (iPGCs) are transplanted into the recipients, which are self-crossed to produce 189/509 somatic cells derived chicken with the donor’s characteristics. Microsatellite analysis and genome sequencing confirm the inheritance of genetic information from the donor. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of avian cloning from somatic cells.
      
      
        The authors reprogram chicken fibroblast cells to form primordial germ cells (PGCs) in one species (black feather Langshan chicken) and then show such PGCs can be transplanted and migrate into the genital ridge of another chicken species (White Plymouth Rock) to produce viable offspring with the Characteristics of donor.

"Evidences are escalating on the diverse neurologicaldisorders and asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID19 pandemic due to the Sanalfowchoking.

This mathematicalmodel is capable of predicting exactly the 3Dboundarylayerblockage factor of nanoscale diabaticfuidfow systems (fow involves the transfer of heat) at the Sanalfowchoking condition. As the pressure of the diabatic nanofuid and/ or noncontinuumfows rises, average-mean-free-path diminishes and thus, the Knudsen-number lowers heading to a zeroslip wallboundary condition with the compressibleviscousfow regime in the nanoscaletubes leading to Sanal-fow-choking due to the sonicfuidthroat efect.

in rosuvastatin exposure. PK characteristics, including intestinal and hepatic transporter/enzyme
specificities of telmisartan and rosuvastatin, were incorporated into the PBPK models to simulate a
rosuvastatin (20 mg) – telmisartan (80 mg) multiple dose drug interaction study. The simulated
rosuvastatin CmaxI/Cmax and AUCI/AUC (with/without telmisartan) ratios were 1.96 and 1.17,
respectively, and the Tmax changed from 3.35 h to 1.41 h with co-administration of telmisartan, which
are consistent with the aforementioned report (CmaxI/Cmax: 2.01, AUCI/AUC: 1.18, Tmax:
5 h → 0.75 h). The decrease in the CLint,BCRP, intestine of rosuvastatin by telmisartan in the PBPK model
was pivotal to reproducing this finding in Simcyp. Although most of the PK changes of rosuvastatin
are known to be OATP1B1-mediated, our PBPK model demonstrated that the major cause of
rosuvastatin–telmisartan DDI is intestinal BCRP-mediated, and not OATP1B1/1B3-mediated
interactions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Aims. To assess whether there is a change in the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation
after the strict lockdown measures due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain,
and to assess which are the factors associated with the incidence of a depressive episode or
suicidal ideation during the lockdown.
Methods. Data from a longitudinal adult population-based cohort from Madrid and
Barcelona were analysed (n = 1103). Face-to-face home-based (pre-pandemic) and telephone
interviews were performed. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed through an adaptation of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Population prevalence
estimates and multivariable logistic regressions were computed.
Results. Prevalence rates of depression changed significantly from before to after the COVID19 outbreak (from 3.06% to 12.00%; p = 0.01) and per sex and age groups. Individuals reporting
COVID-19 concerns (odds ratio [OR] = 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45–6.69)
and those feeling loneliness (OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.52–2.61) during the lockdown were at
increased risk of developing depression during the confinement. Resilience showed a protective effect against the risk of depression (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.39–0.83), while individuals
perceiving social support during the confinement were at lower risk of developing suicidal
thoughts (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09–0.46). Greater disability during the lockdown was also
associated with the risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.53–5.03).
Conclusions. Continuous reinforcement of mental health preventive and intervening measures is of global importance, particularly among vulnerable groups who are experiencing the
most distress. Future research should strive to evaluate the long-term effects of the COVID-19
crisis on mental health.",0
"The optimal scheduling problem of integrated energy system (IES) has the characteristics of highdimensional nonlinearity. Using the traditional Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to solve the problem, it is
easy to fall into a local optimum in the process of optimization, resulting in a low-quality scheduling
scheme. Aiming at the dispatchability of electric and heat loads, this paper proposes an electric and
heat comprehensive demand response model considering the participation of dispatchers. On the
basis of incentive demand response, the group aggregation model of electrical load is constructed,
and the electric load response model is constructed with the goal of minimizing the deviation between
the dispatch signal and the load group aggregation characteristic model. Then, a heat load scheduling
model is constructed according to the ambiguity of the human body’s perception of temperature. On
the basis of traditional GWO, the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is used to group wolves,
which increases the diversity of the population, uses the Harris Hawk Optimizer (HHO) to design the
prey to search for the best escape position, and reduces the local The optimal probability, and the use
of Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) and Bat Optimizer (BO) to design the moving modes of diferent
positions, increase the ability to fnd the global optimum, so as to obtain an Improved Gray Wolf
Optimizer (IGWO), and then efciently solve the model. IGWO can improve the defect of insufcient
population diversity in the later stage of evolution, so that the population diversity can be better
maintained during the entire evolution process. While taking into account the speed of optimization,
it improves the algorithm’s ability to jump out of the local optimum and realizes continuous deep
search. Compared with the traditional intelligent Optimizer, IGWO has obvious improvement and
achieved better results. At the same time, the comprehensive demand response that considers the
dispatcher’s desired signal improves the accommodation of new energy and reduces the operating
cost of the system, and promotes the benign interaction between the source and the load.",0
" Introduction
          Automatic blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are more and more often used in BP self-checks and in 24-hour BP monitoring. Nowadays, 24-hour BP monitoring is a necessary procedure in arterial hypertension treatment. The aim of this study was to validate the BPLab® ambulatory blood pressure monitor according to the European standard BS EN 1060-4:2004 and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol, as well as to work out solutions regarding the suitability of using this device in clinical practice.
        
        
          Methods
          A group of 85 patients of both sexes and different ages, who voluntarily agreed to take part in the tests and were given detailed instructions on the measurement technique were recruited for this study. The results of the BP measurement obtained by a qualified operator using the BPLab® device were compared with the BP values measured using the Korotkov auscultatory method. Data were obtained simultaneously by two experts with experience of over 10 years and had completed a noninvasive BP measurement standardization training course. Discrepancies in the systolic and diastolic BP measurements (N = 510; 255 for each expert) were analyzed according to the criteria specified in the BHS-93 protocol.
        
        
          Results
          The device passed the requirements of the European Standard BS EN 1060-4:2004 and was graded ‘A’ according to the criteria of the BHS protocol for both systolic BP and diastolic BP.
        
        
          Conclusion
          The BPLab® 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device may be recommended for extensive clinical use.",0
"Objective: The association between effort-reward imbalance (ERI) and various health outcomes has been well documented over the past
20 years, but the mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear. The present meta-analysis assessed the associations of ERI
and overcommitment (OC) in the workplace with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis measures.
Methods: Electronic databases were searched with the phrase “effort*reward*imbalance,” which yielded 319 studies leading to 56 fulltext studies being screened. Thirty-two studies within 14 articles met inclusion criteria and were meta-analyzed using mixed and random
effects models.
Results: Greater ERI was associated with increased HPA axis activity (r = .09, p < .001, k = 14, N = 2541). The cortisol awakening response (r = .14, p < .001, k = 9, N = 584) and cortisol waking concentrations (r = .12, p = .01, k = 6, N = 493) were the only HPA measures
associated with ERI. OC was also associated with greater HPA axis activity (r = .06, p < .01, k = 10, N = 1918). Cortisol (PM) (r = .13,
p = .02, k = 3, N = 295) was the only HPA measure associated with OC.
Conclusions: ERI and OC were similarly related with HPA responsivity. However, because OC moderated the relationship between ERI
and HPA axis markers, the importance of OC should not be overlooked. Because OC is likely more malleable than ERI to intervention, this
may be a promising avenue for future research.

"Purpose
          To identify and characterize the most cited publications in orthopaedic research related to posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries of the knee.
        
        
          Methods
          The Science Citation Index Expanded was queried for PLC injury articles. The 50 most-cited studies from 1976 to 2021 were selected. Article characteristics, including number of citations, citation density, year of publication, source journal, country of origin, article type, article subtype, and level of evidence, were analyzed.
        
        
          Results
          The number of citations for individual articles ranged from 47 to 205. The 50 most cited articles were published in 16 journals. Eleven of the 50 articles (22%) were published in Arthroscopy—The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery. The largest proportion of the articles (n = 22, 44%) were classified as clinical, with the rest classified as reviews (n = 15, 30%), and basic science research (n = 13, 26%). The most common level of evidence for clinical articles was IV (14/22, 63.6%). Nine countries contributed to the top 50 articles, with the majority published in the United States (n = 35, 70%).
        
        
          Conclusions
          In the last 20 years, papers published on the diagnosis and surgical management of PLC injuries have a high citation frequency. Future high-quality research is needed to establish best-practice guidelines for the management of PLC injuries due to the low overall level of evidence of existing clinical studies.
        
        
          Clinical Relevance
          This research provides a comprehensive list for practitioners and may help educators identify articles to include in the curriculum for residents and fellows.
         The posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee was once referred to as the “dark side” of the knee due to the historically limited understanding of PLC anatomy and the poor outcomes associated with injuries to this area.1 The PLC is a complex anatomical area that includes the lateral collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and the popliteofibular ligament.2 Injuries to the PLC often go undiagnosed and were previously considered to be a rare condition; however, they recently have been reported to be present in up to 16% of knee injuries.3 PLC injuries most often occur in conjunction with injury to other structures of the knee. Injury to the PLC of the knee is particularly associated with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, followed by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Up to 70% of PCL tears show concomitant damage to the PLC. While the identification of PLC injuries is sometimes difficult, diagnosis is crucial to optimizing surgical and clinical outcomes in these patients.4 If left untreated, these injuries can lead to chronic pain and instability, early development of osteoarthritis, and failure of cruciate ligament reconstructions.2,3,5
    Citation impact, or how many times a scientific publication is cited in the literature, can be used as an indicator of an article’s influence in a particular field of study.6,7 Although the number of times an article has been cited is not the only factor determining the importance an article has on its area of medical expertise, it can be useful for indicating the landmark scientific investigations or “citation classics” in a particular field.8 Analyses of most-cited papers can prove valuable to medical educators by helping identify articles of particular importance that may warrant inclusion in their trainees’ reading curriculum.
    In 2011, Lefaivre et al.9 published a citation analysis of the seminal works in orthopaedic surgery, and multiple similar studies have since investigated the most influential papers related to various orthopaedic subspecialties and conditions.7,9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize the most-cited publications in orthopaedic research related to PLC injuries of the knee. It was hypothesized that there would be many highly-cited articles related to PLC injuries published in the last 2 decades and that the minority would present high levels of evidence.",0
"Objective. Propofol is a classical anesthetic and induces consciousness loss, and gamma-aminobutyric-acid-type-A (GABA-A)
receptor is its target. Righting reflex is associated with conscious response. The nucleus basalis (NB) acts as a major relay
between the reticular activating system and the frontal cortex (FC). Propofol may mediate righting reflex by affecting GABA-A
receptor in NB. Methods. Fifty male SD rats (250-350 g) were divided into parts I and II. In part I, 20 male SD rats were
randomly divided into control group (CG) and NB-lesion group (NG, ibotenic acid-induced NB lesion). In part II, 30 male SD
rats were treated with saline (0.9% NaCl, SG group), muscimol (a GABA-A receptor agonist, MG group), and gabazine
(a GABA-A receptor antagonist, GG group) in NB, respectively. Two weeks later, the activity of the rats was measured between
CG and NG groups. The rats were intravenously injected with propofol (50 mg/kg/h) to test the time of loss of righting reflex
(LORR) in all rats. When LORR occurred, the rats received single administration of propofol (12 mg/kg) to measure the time of
return of righting reflex (RORR). Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of the frontal cortex (FC) was recorded. Results. The
numbers of NB neurons were reduced by 44% in the NG group compared to the CG group (p < 0:05) whereas the activity of
rats was reduced a little in the NG group when compared with the CG group, but the statistical difference was insignificant
(p > 0:05). The dose-response curve of propofol shifted to the left in the NG group, and the statistical difference for the time of
LORR was insignificant between the two groups (p > 0:05). However, the time of RORR and FC delta power increased in the
NG group compared with the CG group (p < 0:05). In part II, the time of RORR and FC powder increased in the MG group
when compared to the SG group while reverse results were observed in the GG group (p < 0:05). There was no significant
influence on the time of LORR and ED50 among the three groups (p > 0:05). Conclusions. The unilateral NB lesion increased
the recovery time and FC delta power, and the NB region might be involved in the emergence after propofol administration.
Propofol plays a crucial role for causing conscious loss by affecting GABA-A receptor in NB.",0
"Background. Along with increasing research on acupuncture for chronic pain, the validity of sham acupuncture (SA)
has also been argued. Methods. Nine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the
inception dates of the databases to July 5, 2022. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a Bayesian multipletreatment network meta-analysis (NMA) with random-effects model was conducted. Results. A total of 62 RCTs with
6,806 patients and four kinds of treatments (real acupuncture [RA], non-acupuncture [NA], penetrative SA [PSA], and
non-penetrative SA [NPSA]) were included. The results indicated that both NPSA and PSA were not superior to NA
in improving chronic pain (NPSA: mean difference [MD]¼ –4.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] –11.09 to 1.52; PSA:
MD¼ –4.96, 95% CI –10.38 to 0.48). After NPSA and PSA were combined into the SA group, the weak trend of pain
relief from SA was still not statistically significant (MD¼ –4.91, 95% CI –9.93 to 0.05). NPSA and PSA had similar
effects (MD¼ 0.18, 95% CI –5.45 to 5.81). RA was significantly associated with pain relief, compared with NPSA and
PSA (NPSA: MD¼ –12.03, 95% CI –16.62 to –7.41; PSA: MD¼ –11.85, 95% CI –15.48 to –8.23). The results were generally consistent regardless of pain phenotype, frequency, duration, acupuncture methods, analgesic intake, or detection bias. Conclusion. These results suggested that acupuncture was significantly associated with reduced chronic
pain. The two kinds of placebo acupuncture, NPSA and PSA, have similar effects. Both NPSA and PSA, with a weak
but not significant effect, are appropriate to be inert placebo controls in RCTs for chronic pain.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
was to investigate the role of LINC01296 in the
progression of liver cancer (LCa) and to explore
its possible molecular mechanisms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TCGA database
was used for information mining to verify the expression of LINC01296 in liver tumor tissues and
normal tissues. The levels of LINC01296 in 40 pairs
of LCa and adjacent tissues, as well as normal liver
cell lines and liver cancer cell lines, were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (qRT-PCR). The Chi-square test was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of
tumor samples and LINC01296 expression. Meanwhile, the Chi-square test was used to explore the
relationship between different clinical indicators
and the expression of LINC01296. The liver cancer
cell lines were screened and transfected with siRNA-LINC01296 and microRNA-760 inhibitor, as well
as corresponding negative controls, respectively.
Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays
were used to determine the effects of LINC01296
on the proliferative and invasive capacities of cells.
Furthermore, the regulatory association between
LINC01296 and microRNA-760 was verified by the
Dual-Luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: LINC01296 expression was remarkably higher in LCa tissues than that of normal
liver tissues. Meanwhile, LINC01296 expression
was associated with poor prognosis of LCa.
Patients with high LINC01296 expression were
more likely to have lymph node metastasis. In
vitro experiments showed that the knockdown
of LINC01296 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Meanwhile, microRNA-760 was remarkably lowly expressed in
LCa tissues and cells. Subsequent experiments
indicated that LINC01296 was regulated by
miR760 in LCa tissues, and high expression of
linc0129 could limit microRNA-760 expression.
Furthermore, the inhibition of microRNA-760 in
HCC cells reversed the effect of LINC01296
knockdown on cell proliferation and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: LINC01296 could promote the
proliferative ability and invasiveness of hepatoma cells by inhibiting the expression of microRNA-760. Moreover, its expression was closely related to lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of LCa. ",0
"  A prevalent symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is hypomimia — reduced facial expressions. In this paper, we present a method for diagnosing PD that utilizes the study of micro-expressions. We analyzed the facial action units (AU) from 1812 videos of 604 individuals (61 with PD and 543 without PD, with a mean age 63.9 y/o, sd. 7.8) collected online through a web-based tool (www.parktest.net). In these videos, participants were asked to make three facial expressions (a smiling, disgusted, and surprised face) followed by a neutral face. Using techniques from computer vision and machine learning, we objectively measured the variance of the facial muscle movements and used it to distinguish between individuals with and without PD. The prediction accuracy using the facial micro-expressions was comparable to methodologies that utilize motor symptoms. Logistic regression analysis revealed that participants with PD had less variance in AU6 (cheek raiser), AU12 (lip corner puller), and AU4 (brow lowerer) than non-PD individuals. An automated classifier using Support Vector Machine was trained on the variances and achieved 95.6% accuracy. Using facial expressions as a future digital biomarker for PD could be potentially transformative for patients in need of remote diagnoses due to physical separation (e.g., due to COVID) or immobility.",0

"BACKGROUND
          Reflux esophagitis (RE) is a common digestive disorder, and its frequent recurrences cause significant physical pain and are financially burdensome to patients. However, studies on the natural history of treated RE are few. Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as the first-line treatment provide notable symptomatic relief, disordered gut microbiota has been observed among PPI users. Probiotics are commonly administered to patients to regulate the disordered intestinal flora.
        
        
          AIM
          To evaluate the therapeutic effects in RE patients treated with a combination of esomeprazole and probiotics [Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium)].
        
        
          METHODS
          One hundred and thirty-four RE patients were randomized into two groups of 67 subjects each. The probiotics group was administered with esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. and live combined B. subtilis and E. faecium enteric-coated capsules 500 mg t.i.d. for eight weeks; the placebo group was administered with esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. and placebo for eight weeks. Subsequently, 12-wk follow-up was carried out on patients who achieved both endoscopic and clinical cure. Endoscopy, reflux diagnostic questionnaire (RDQ), gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), and lactulose hydrogen breath test were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
        
        
          RESULTS
          Sixty-six patients in the probiotics group and 64 patients in the placebo group completed the 8-wk treatment. The healing rate and RDQ score had no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, the GSRS diarrhea syndrome score was decreased significantly in the probiotics group (P = 0.002), and the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth negative rate in the probiotics group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (P = 0.002). Of 114 endoscopically and clinically cured patients, 96 completed the follow-up. The log-rank test showed that the time to relapse was shorter in the placebo group than in the probiotics group (P = 0.041). Furthermore, the therapy had a significant influence on relapse time, and the risk of relapse in the probiotics group was lower than that in the placebo group at any time point during the 12-wk follow-up (hazard ratio = 0.52, P = 0.033).
        
        
          CONCLUSION
          Esomeprazole combined with probiotics (B. subtilis and E. faecium) have a beneficial effect on RE treatment and patient management.

"Background: To investigate the association between keratoconus (KC) and
allergic eye diseases, eye rubbing, and atopy.
Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were
searched for studies investigating eye allergy, atopy, and eye rubbing as risk
factors for KC up to April 2021. Two authors independently screened all titles
and abstracts against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study
analysed the prevalence of KC and its risk factors, including eye rubbing, family history of KC, atopy, and allergic eye diseases. The National Institutes of
Health Study Quality Assessment Tool was used. Pooled data are presented as
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The analysis was conducted using RevMan version 5.4 software.
Results: The initial search yielded 573 articles. After screening, 21 studies
were identified for qualitative analysis and 15 for quantitative synthesis. A significant association was found between KC and eye rubbing (OR = 5.22, 95%
CI [2.80, 9.75], p < 0.00001), family history of KC (OR = 6.67, 95% CI [4.77,
9.33], p < 0.00001), and allergies (OR = 2.21, 95% CI [1.57, 3.13], p < 0.00001).
However, no significant association was found between KC and allergic eye
disease (OR = 1.82, 95% CI [0.37, 8.97], p = 0.46), atopy (OR = 1.54, 95% CI

"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is one of the most common causes of
acute liver injury (ALI) in Western countries. Many studies show that the gut microbiota plays an important role in liver injury. Currently, the only approved treatment
for APAP-induced ALI is N-acetylcysteine; therefore, it is essential to develop new
therapeutic agents and explore the underlying mechanisms. We developed a novel
monoclonal anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antibody (ATAB) and hypothesized that it
has therapeutic effects on APAP-induced ALI and that gut microbiota may be involved
in the underlying mechanism of ATAB treatment. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with
APAP and ATAB, which produced a therapeutic effect on ALI and altered the gut
microbiota and their metabolic pathway, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia,
and the fatty acid pathway, etc. Furthermore, we verified that purified short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) could alleviate ALI. Moreover, a separate group of mice that received
feces from the ATAB group showed less severe liver injury compared with the mice
receiving feces from the APAP group. ATAB therapy also improved the gut barrier functions in mice and reduced the expression of protein zonulin. Our results revealed that
gut microbiota plays an important role in the therapeutic effect of ATAB on APAPinduced ALI.
IMPORTANCE In this study, we found the monoclonal anti-Toll-like receptor 4 antibody can alleviate APAP-induced acute liver injury through the change of the gut
microbiota, metabolic pathways, and gut barrier function. This work suggested the
gut microbiota can be the therapeutic target of the APAP-induced acute liver injury,
and we performed the fundamental research for further research.",0
"In this work, a novel lollipop nanostructure of Co3O4@MnO2 composite is
prepared as anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Cobalt metal–
organic framework (ZIF-67) is grown on the open end of MnO2 nanotubes
via a self-assembly process. The obtained ZIF-67@MnO2 is then converted
to Co3O4@MnO2 by a simple annealing treatment in air. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction
characterizations indicate that the prepared Co3O4@MnO2 takes a lollipop
nanostructure with a stick of ≈100 nm in diameter, consisting of MnO2
nanotube, and a head part of ≈1 µm, consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles. The
charge–discharge tests illustrate that this unique novel configuration endows
the resulting Co3O4@MnO2 with excellent electrochemical performances,
delivering a capacity of 1080 mAh g−1

(LHCWs) who were respectively exposed to COVID-19 wards and non-COVID-19 wards by following up on mental disorders in
HCWs in China for 6 months.
Methods: A multi-psychological assessment questionnaire was used to follow up on the psychological status of HCWs in the
Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou City (a non-core epidemic area) at 6 months after the first evaluation
conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic. Based on the risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the HCWs were divided into two
groups: high-risk HCWs, who worked in COVID-19 wards, and low-risk HCWs, who worked in non-COVID-19 wards.
Results: A total of 198 HCWs participated in the study, and 168 questionnaires were selected for evaluation. Among them, 93
(55.4%) were in the HHCW group and 75 (44.5%) were in the LHCW group. Significant differences were observed in salary,
profession, and altruistic behavior between the two groups (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the anxiety, depression,
insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores between the two groups. Logistic regression revealed that work stress was
a major joint risk factor for mental disorders in HCWs. Among all the HCWs, a total of 58 voluntarily participated in psychotherapy;
the analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety, depression, PTSD, work stress, and work risk after attending psychotherapy.
There were also significant differences in positive and negative coping styles before and after psychotherapy.
Conclusion: In the present follow-up, work stress was the major contributing factor to mental disorders in HCWs. Psychotherapy is
helpful in terms of stress management and should be provided to first-line COVID-19 HCWs.

"– OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence has suggested that aberrant expression
of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) proliferation, migration, invasion and chemotherapy resistance.
Cullin4A (CUL4A) has been previously reported to desensitize NSCLC cells to chemotherapy
treatment. However, whether miRNAs regulate
CUL4A to promote chemotherapy resistance remains unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tissues were obtained from 40 NSCLC patients who received
surgery at the Yancheng City No. 1 People’s
Hospital. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays
were applied for the detection of cell proliferation; mRNA and protein levels were determined
by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. The interaction between mRNA 3’UTR and
miRNA was predicted by TargetScan and verified by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: In the present study, miR-363-
3p levels were revealed to be significantly decreased in tumor tissues obtained from NSCLC
patients compared with adjacent normal tissues. The results of the CCK-8 assays showed
that the overexpression of miR-363-3p may
slightly inhibit the proliferation of A549 and H23
cells. Notably, the transfection with miR-363-
3p antagonists reduced the sensitivity of A549
and H23 cells to gemcitabine treatment, whereas the overexpression of miR-363-3p markedly
increased the sensitivity of A549 and H23 cells
to gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, CUL4A
mRNA and protein levels were revealed to be
decreased in A549 cells transfected with miR363-3p mimics. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay results further suggested that CUL4A represents a target gene of miR-363-3p.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that decreased miR-363-3p expression enhanced gemcitabine resistance in NSCLC cells via regulation
of CUL4A.",0
"Summary
Introduction
The goal of hypospadias surgery is to provide a
functionally and cosmetically normal penis. Whether
this goal will be to the patient’s satisfaction depends
largely on the original anatomy, surgical technique
and surgeon’s experience. It has been suggested
that androgen administration is associated with
better outcomes in hypospadias repair; however,
few studies have included control groups and the
issue is still controversial.
Purpose
To evaluate the effects of parenteral testosterone
administration on the results of hypospadias repair
in children with untreated hypospadias.
Materials and methods
A total of 182 children with midshaft or distal
hypospadias and a mean age of 30 months (range
18e52 months) were enrolled in this study. Consecutive children were randomly allocated to the study
group (testosterone administration) (Group 1,
n Z 91) or control group (Group 2, n Z 91). Only
children with a flat urethral plate were included in
this study. The control group did not receive any
pre-operative treatment. Children with a previous
history of hypospadias repair and any proven endocrine disorder were excluded. The study children
received 2 mg/kg testosterone enanthate monthly
for two months before surgery. Tubularized incised
plate (TIP) urethroplasty, with or without chordee
correction, was performed for all children in both
groups by the same urologist. Hypospadias repair
was performed 4 weeks after the second dose of
testosterone administration. Postoperative complications were recorded, including: urethrocutaneous
fistulas, urethral diverticula, meatal stenosis, and
glanular dehiscence. The mean stretched penile
length and circumference were measured at baseline and at 1 month and 2 months post operation. All
children were examined every month for any
adverse affects to testosterone treatment, like
pubic and axillary hair, and height acceleration, up
to 3 months post operation.
Results
An increase in penile length (from 28.1  2.2 mm to
38.5  2.6 mm) (P Z 0.001) and penile circumference (from 35.1  1.6 mm to 45.5  2.2 mm)
(P Z 0.001) were noticed in all but four children in
Group 1. The actual values for increase in penile
length in the study group were, 22.0%, 35.0% and
36.0%, at postinjection months 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P Z 0.01, P Z 0.001 and P Z 0.001,
respectively) (Figure). The actual values for increase
in penile circumference in the study group were,
16.0%, 27.0% and 29.0%, at postinjection months 1, 2
and 3, respectively (P Z 0.01, P Z 0.001 and
P Z 0.001, respectively). The overall complication
rates were significantly higher in Group 2 [12 children, 13.18%) compared to Group 1 (five children,
5.45%) (P Z 0.03). Urethrocutaneous fistula was the
most common complication in both groups (four
children [4.39%] in Group 1 and seven children
[7.69%] in Group 2) (P Z 0.02), followed by meatal
stenosis (one child [1.09%] in Group 1 and three
children [3.29%] in Group 2) (P Z 0.03). All children
in Group 1 developed pigmentation of the genitalia,
and scant pubic hair appeared in 14 of them. These
side effects disappeared by the 3 months
postoperation follow-up visit.
Discussion
Tubularized incised plate urethroplasty is a popular
reconstructive method for hypospadias repair and is
widely accepted by pediatric urologists. It is a reliable and simple technique with low complication
rates. Testosterone administration before hypospadias repair decreases complication rates, reduces the
need for reoperation and results in better cosmetic
outcomes. Some studies have demonstrated temporary side effects like pubic hair growth and aggressive behavior, which gradually became normalized
after treatment cessation. Nowadays, many pediatric urologists administer testosterone prior to hypospadias surgery; however, this can be variable.
Conclusion
Parenteral testosterone administration before
hypospadias repair is beneficial in decreasing
complication rates.",0
"We conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the correlations of ezrin expression with pathological characteristics
and the prognosis of osteosarcoma. Te MEDLINE (1966–2013), the Cochrane Library Database, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of
Science (1945–2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database were searched without language restrictions. Meta-analyses conducted
using STATA sofware were calculated. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, including 459 patients with osteosarcoma. Metaanalysis results illustrated that ezrin expression may be closely associated with the recurrence of osteosarcoma or metastasis in
osteosarcoma. Our fndings also demonstrated that patients with grade III-IV osteosarcoma showed a higher frequency of ezrin
expression than those with histological grade I-II osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we found that patients with positive expression of
ezrin exhibited a shorter overall survival than those with negative ezrin expression. Te results also indicated that positive ezrin
expression was strongly correlated with poorer metastasis-free survival. Nevertheless, no signifcant relationships were observed
between ezrin expression and clinical variables (age and gender). In the current meta-analysis, our results illustrated signifcant
relationships of ezrin expression with pathological characteristics and prognosis of osteosarcoma. Tus, ezrin expression could be
a promising marker in predicting the clinical outcome of patients with osteosarcoma.",0
"Bone regeneration, as a physiological process of bone formation, is regulated by
multiple cytokines. Long noncoding RNAs are involved in the progress of bone
formation. The present study investigated role by which ZBED3‐AS1 acts to control
the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone regeneration.
Bioinformatics prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assay identified putative
ZBED3‐AS1 binding sites on the 3′‐untranslated region of interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β).
Then, RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ZBED3‐AS1 could regulate the expression of IL‐1β by binding to the
transcription factor CREB. Notably, ZBED3‐AS1 was shown to negatively regulate IL‐
1β expression. After model establishment in rats simulating bone injury, MSCs were
isolated and delivered with ZBED3‐AS1, Si‐ZBED3‐AS1, Si‐IL‐1β, or DKK (inhibitor of
Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway) to identify their roles in osteogenic differentiation
by evaluating MSC colony formation and proliferation. Then, number of mineralized
nodules, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OCN) expression, and
expression of osteogenesis‐related genes were determined. Overexpression of
ZBED3‐AS1 or silencing of IL‐1β was shown to accelerate ectopic osteogenesis, as
reflected by increasing the number of mineralized nodules, ALP activity, and OCN
expression, and promoting MSC colony formation and proliferation. Additionally,
ZBED3‐AS1 activated the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway by negatively regulating
IL‐1β. IL‐1β inhibited osteogenic differentiation by suppressing the Wnt/β‐catenin
signaling pathway. Furthermore, the effect of ZBED3‐AS1 and IL‐1β on osteogenic
differentiation was confirmed in vivo. Taken together, upregulation of ZBED3‐AS1
could restore differentiation of MSCs and enhance bone regeneration via activation
of Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway by repressing IL‐1β.",0
"Growing evidence suggested that the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate several
pathophysiological processes in tumorigenesis and may be new biomarkers for tumor
therapy. In this study, we studied the expression and role of lncRNA MT1JP in the
development of bladder cancer. We demonstrated that the expression of MT1JP was
downregulated in bladder tumor samples and cell lines. Ectopic expression of MT1JP
suppressed cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion in bladder cancer. In addition, our result
suggested that miR‐214‐3p overexpression decreased the luciferase activity of wild‐type
MT1JP but not mutated‐type MT1JP and elevated expression of MT1JP decreased miR‐
214‐3p expression in the bladder cancer cell. Furthermore, we indicated that the
expression of miR‐214‐3p was upregulated in bladder tumor samples and cell lines.
Ectopic expression of miR‐214‐3p promoted cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion in
bladder cancer. MT1JP suppressed cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion via negative
modulation of miR‐214‐3p in bladder cancer. These data suggested that lncRNA MT1JP
acts a tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer progression, considering MT1JP as a
new therapeutic target in bladder cancer.",0
"More and more evidence show that major depressive disorder (MDD) is closely
related to inflammation caused by chronic stress, which seriously affects human
physical and mental health. However, the inflammatory mechanism of depression and its effect on brain function have not been clarified. Based on restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we investigated change
of brain functional imaging and the inflammatory mechanism of damage-related
molecular patterns (DAMPs)—receptor of advanced glycation protein end product (RAGE) in MDD patients and depressive-like cynomolgus monkeys and mice
models induced by chronic stress. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) were analyzed using MATLAB and SPM12 software. We
detected the expression of DAMPs-RAGE pathway-related proteins and mRNA
in MDD peripheral blood and in serum and brain tissue of cynomolgus monkeys
and mice. Meanwhile, RAGE gene knockout mice, RAGE inhibitor, and overexpression of AVV9RAGE adeno-associated virus were used to verify that RAGE is
a reliable potential biomarker of depression. The results showed that the ReHo

value of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in MDD patients and depressive-like cynomolgus monkeys was decreased. Then, the PFC was used as a seed point, the FC of
ipsilateral and contralateral PFC were weakened in depressive-like mice. At the
same time, qPCR showed that RAGE and HMGB1 mRNA were upregulated and
S100β mRNA was downregulated. The expression of RAGE-related inflammatory protein in PFC of depressive-like monkeys and mice were consistent with
that in peripheral blood of MDD patients. Moreover, the results were confirmed
in RAGE–/– mice, injection of FPS-ZM1, and overexpression of AAV9RAGE in
mice. To sum up, our findings enhance the evidence that chronic stress-PFCRAGE are associated with depression. These results attempt to establish the links
between brain functional imaging, and molecular targets among different species
will help to reveal the pathophysiological mechanism of depression from multiple perspectives.",0
"Resistin, secreted by macrophages in tumor microenvironment, has never been
investigated in pancreatic cancer models, despite a vibrant tumor microenvironment
around pancreatic tumors. We evaluated serum resistin levels in healthy individuals
versus pancreatic cancer patients representing different tumor grades. In vitro
mechanistic analysis involved MiaPaCa‐2 and SW1990 cells. Resistin signaling
depends on binding of resistin to its cognitive receptors. Therefore, we silenced
adenylyl cyclase‐associated protein 1 (CAP1) and toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4), its two
known receptors, individually as well as in combination, by short hairpin RNA
(shRNA). Effect of resistin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and
sensitivity to gemcitabine was studied without or with silencing of resistin receptors
CAP1 and/or TLR4. The results were also confirmed in vivo in mice xenografted with
MiaPaCa‐2 cells without or with receptor silencing. We report high resistin levels in
pancreatic cancer patients which correlate positively with tumor grades. We
observed a marked reduction in the resistin‐induced proliferation, migration,
invasion, and cell cycle of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa‐2 and SW1990 when
the receptors were silenced. The results were confirmed in vivo wherein resistin
effects were significantly attenuated in MiaPaCa‐2 xenografts with silenced
receptors. The combined silencing of CAP1 and TLR4 was found to be most effective
in vitro and in vivo. We found activation of STAT3 by resistin in vivo and in vitro
which was dependent on the presence of CAP1 and TLR4. Further, resistin was found
to induce resistance to gemcitabine through its receptors. Our results describe novel
functional roles of resistin with implications toward a better understanding of
pancreatic tumor microenvironment.",0

"Background: The intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) is associated with high mortality and severe disability in survivors, which
causing about 42% of the disability-adjusted life years lost and 50% of all stroke patients dead within 1 year. Although early functional
training is recommended to facility rehabilitation after the stroke, the benefit and safety are still controversial.
Introduction: This systematic review aims to investigate whether early physical rehabilitation could have a beneficial effect for the
patients with ICH compared with standard rehabilitation care.
Methods and analysis: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane library will be searched to include randomized control trials which
investigate the rehabilitation effective of the early mobilization for patients with ICH compared with routine nursing or standard care.
Rev-Man version 5.3 will be used to perform all calculations related to the meta-analysis. Dichotomous data will be calculated in terms
of a fixed or random effect model and expressed by the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochrane
collaborations tool in the following aspects was used to assess the risk of bias (ROB) in included studies. The inconsistency index (I

"t. Background/Aim: The aim of this study was the
conception, production, material analysis and
cytocompatibility analysis of a new collagen foam for
medical applications. Materials and Methods: After the
innovative production of various collagen sponges from
bovine sources, the foams were analyzed ex vivo in terms of
their structure (including pore size) and in vitro in terms of
cytocompatibility according to EN ISO 10993-5/-12. In vitro,
the collagen foams were compared with the established soft
and hard tissue materials cerabone and Jason membrane
(both botiss biomaterials GmbH, Zossen, Germany). Results:
Collagen foams with different compositions were successfully
produced from bovine sources. Ex vivo, the foams showed a
stable and long-lasting primary structure quality with a
bubble area of 1,000 to 2,000 μm2. In vitro, all foams
showed sufficient cytocompatibility. Conclusion: Collagen
sponges represent a promising material for hard and soft
tissue regeneration. Future studies could focus on
integrating and investigating different additives in the foams.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body
and constitutes around 25-30% of the total amount of protein
(1, 2). Up to now, 28 different types of collagen have been
discovered (3). As an essential part of the extracellular
matrix (ECM), different collagen types can be found in
bones, cartilage, tendons and skin, as well as in teeth, cornea
and blood vessels (4-6). Collagen is biocompatible and
completely biodegradable by endogenous human proteases
(7, 8). In addition, it is characterized by its ability to
positively influence cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and
differentiation (1, 4, 9). These qualities can be further
increased by adding growth and differentiation factors to the
collagen matrix (10, 11). Antibacterial properties can be
developed by adding nanoparticles such as AgNP (12, 13).
By additional physical as well as chemical cross-linking (6-
8, 14) or the combination of different types of collagen with
and without additional bioabsorbable materials, the usually
short-lasting degradation time of natural collagen can be
further extended, which ensures a sufficient durability (e.g.,
in wound dressings) (15, 16).
These properties make collagen as one of the most
promising biomaterials in modern medicine. Depending on
the area of application, it is obtained autogenously,
allogenically or xenogenically (17, 18). Collagen is widely
used as a wound dressing in the treatment of acute or chronic
wounds (19), burn wounds (20, 21) or sites of skin donation
and skin grafts (22), through its ability of shielding the
wound from infection and contamination, reducing scarring,
absorbing wound exudate, and promoting the skin’s natural
regeneration ability (19, 23, 24). In addition, collagen is able
to bind platelets and thus activate the coagulation cascade
(25, 26), which makes it very suitable for acute use in wound
care. Resorbable barrier membranes made of collagen are of
great importance in guided bone regeneration (GBR) for
dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, in order to
shield the regenerating bone from the ingrowth of the
surrounding tissue (27-29). Furthermore, different
compositions of collagen can be used as tissue grafts in

peripheral nerve regeneration, vascular prostheses and
arterial reconstruction (30-33). In addition, by promoting cell
growth and adhesion, collagen is ideally suited as a
substance in tissue engineering, where it can be used as part
of bioinks to encapsulate cells (34, 35) or as basic substance
for scaffold production (2, 22). Thereby, it is essential for the
development of artificial skin implants (36, 37).
The present study aimed to develop a new collagen foam
based on bovine split skin for tissue regeneration. The
regeneration-promoting properties of collagen are extensively
described in literature (4, 15, 38). Especially for wound
regeneration, collagen foams appear to be a promising
approach, since a foam can optimally adapt to a wound bed in
terms of area and volume and has both a shielding and
cushioning effect on the tissue (19). The approach of using
biomaterials as applicable foams in wound management has
already been implemented in a different context. The wound
foams that have been used up to now are primarily designed
for the care of moist or weeping chronic wounds, as their base
materials have good exudate-absorbing characteristics (19).
With the use of collagen and the creation of a moisturizing
instead of a dehumidifying environment in the wound bed, the
foam presented in this study aims to positively influence the
self-healing of soft tissue by using the natural regenerative
properties of this biomaterial. The newly developed collagenbased foam has the potential to be a new and innovative
biomaterial for use in soft tissue regeneration and could play a
major role in the care of patients with acute or chronic wounds.
The focus of this preclinical study was to analyze the
material characteristics and cytocompatibility of different
novel collagen foams. For this purpose, pore size, density
and surface structure of the foams were examined and
described ex vivo using a dynamic foam analyzer (DFA) and
cryo-SEM. In addition, in vitro cytocompatibility studies
were carried out in accordance with ISO 10993-5/-12, as
already described in previous work (24, 39, 40).",0
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe loss of motor and sensory function with high disability and mortality. The effective treatment of SCI remains unknown. Here we find systemic injection of TGF-β neutralizing antibody induces the protection of axon growth, survival of neurons, and functional recovery, whereas erythropoietin-producing hepatoma interactor B2 (EphrinB2) expression and fibroblasts distribution are attenuated. Knockout of TGF-β type II receptor in fibroblasts can also decrease EphrinB2 expression and improve spinal cord injury recovery. Moreover, miR-488 was confirmed to be the most upregulated gene related to EphrinB2 releasing in fibroblasts after SCI and miR-488 initiates EphrinB2 expression and physical barrier building through MAPK signaling after SCI. Our study points toward elevated levels of active TGF-β as inducer and promoters of fibroblasts distribution, fibrotic scar formation, and EphrinB2 expression, and deletion of global TGF-β or the receptor of TGF-β in Col1α2 lineage fibroblasts significantly improve functional recovery after SCI, which suggest that TGF-β might be a therapeutic target in SCI.

"In this study, the phase transition of NaVO2F2 was measured at different temperatures via in situ Raman
spectroscopy. The NaVO2F2 compounds were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and were
identified to be monoclinic with the P21/c space group at room temperature by XRD. Accordingly, the
variations of Raman shifts and intensities of the characteristic peaks for NaVO2F2 associated with
temperature were obtained and investigated. It was confirmed that NaVO2F2 had three types of phase
transitions, which occurred in the temperature region from 78 K to 573 K. Further, the results indicate
that transition from a low-temperature phase (I) to another low-temperature phase (II), low-temperature
phase (II) to P21/c phase and P21/c phase to P21/m phase occurred near the three temperature points of
93 K, 233 K, and 453 K, respectively, during the heating process. Therefore, a novel characterization
method was provided for further research on the phase transition theory and performance of vanadate
compounds.",0
"Background and objective
The effectiveness of deferred surgical repair of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) post-myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiogenic shock remains limited to case reports. Our study
aimed to investigate the outcomes and survival analysis following mechanical circulatory
support (MCS) in patients after VSR who develop cardiogenic shock.
Methods
We analyzed 27 patients with post-MI VSR and cardiogenic shock who received deferred
surgical repair while stabilized on MCS between January 2018 and March 2020. After normality test adjustments, continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). These were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. To identify predictors
of operative mortality, univariate analysis of clinical characteristics and interventions followed by logistic regression was carried out. P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
All patients had preoperative MCS. Emergency repair was avoided in all the patients. The
mean age of the participants was 64.96 with the majority being males (74.1%). On average,
the mean time from MI to VSR repair was 18.85 days. Delayed revascularization was associated with increased mortality (OR 17.500, 95% CI 2.365–129.506, P = 0.005). Other factors associated with increased mortality were ejection fraction (EF), three-vessel disease,
Killip class, early surgery, and prolonged use of inotropes. The operative mortality was 11%
with an overall mortality of 33.3%. The one-year survival rate was 66.7%. Conclusion
The use of MCS in adjunct to a deferred surgical approach shows an improved survival outcome of patients with VSR complicated by cardiogenic shock. Further investigations are
required regarding the optimal time for MCS and surgical repair.",0
"Long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) was reported to regulate the pathogenesis of ischemic
stroke. The study aimed to disclose SNHG7 role in oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced Neuro-2a (N2a) cell
disorders. An OGD injury cell model was established using N2a cells. The expression of SNHG7, microRNA-134-5p (miR134-5p) and fbroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein
expression was detected by western blot. Cell viability and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage were determined by cell
counting kit-8 and LDH activity detection assays. Oxidative stress was investigated by Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase
activity assays as well as Malondialdehyde and Reactive Oxygen Species detection kits. Cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were severally demonstrated by fow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assays. The interaction between miR-134-5p and
SNHG7 or FGF9 was predicted by online databases, and identifed by mechanism assays. OGD treatment decreased SNHG7
and FGF9 expression, but increased miR-134-5p expression. OGD treatment repressed cell viability, promoted LDH leakage
and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in N2a cells, which was rescued by SNHG7 overexpression. SNHG7 acted as
a sponge for miR-134-5p, and regulated OGD-triggered cell damage by associating with miR-134-5p. Additionally, miR134-5p depletion protected N2a cells from OGD-induced injury by targeting FGF9. Ectopic SNHG7 expression protected
against OGD-induced neuronal cell injury by inducing FGF9 through sponging miR-134-5p, providing a novel therapeutic
target for ischemic stroke.",0
"Aim: We conducted a meta-analysis of case-control studies to determine whether ALDH2, ADH1 and ADH2 genetic
polymorphisms contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
Methods: The PubMed, CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases
were searched for relevant articles published before November 1st, 2013 without any language restrictions. Meta-analysis
was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. We calculated crude odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals
(95%CI) to evaluate their relationships under five genetic models. Seven case-control studies with a total of 2,563 gastric
cancer patients and 4,192 healthy controls met the inclusion criteria. Nine common polymorphisms were evaluated,
including rs671, rs16941667 and rs886205 in the ALDH2 gene, rs1230025, rs13123099, rs698 and rs1693482 in the ADH1
gene, and rs1229984 and rs17033 in the ADH2 gene.
Results: The results of our meta-analysis suggested that ALDH2 genetic polymorphisms might be strongly correlated with
an increased risk of gastric cancer (allele model: OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.11,1.32, P,0.001; dominant model: OR = 1.23, 95%CI:
1.09,1.39, P = 0.001; respectively), especially for rs671 polymorphism. Furthermore, we observed significant associations
between ADH1 genetic polymorphisms and an increased risk of gastric cancer (allele model: OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.08,1.36,
P = 0.001; dominant model: OR = 10.52, 95%CI: 3.04,36.41, P,0.001; respectively), especially for rs1230025 polymorphism.
Nevertheless, no positive relationships were found between ADH2 genetic polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk (all
P.0.05).
Conclusion: The current meta-analysis suggests that ALDH2 and ADH1 genetic polymorphisms may play crucial roles in the
pathogenesis of gastric cancer. However, ADH2 genetic polymorphisms may not be important dominants of susceptibility
to gastric cancer.",0
"Cyanobacterial strains can grow within a specific temperature range that
approximately corresponds to their natural habitat. However, how the preferable temperature range for growth (PTRG) is determined at the molecular
level remains unclear. In this study, we detected a PTRG upshift in a mutant
strain of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 lacking the circadian rhythm
regulator RpaA. Subsequent analyses revealed that RpaA decreases the electron transport from photosystem I to NADPH. The change in electron transport likely inhibits H2O2 generation under high-temperature conditions and
contributes to the observed PTRG upshift in rpaA-deficient cells. The importance of the effects of the circadian rhythm regulator on the PTRG is discussed.

" Background
        Assessment of pain has always been subjective and is commonly assessed using a numeric pain scale (NPS) or Wong-Baker faces scale. The pain intensity score is not standardized and relies on individuals’ past experiences. The disadvantage of using such pain assessment scales and treating the numbers can lead to overdosing on analgesics leading to unwanted side effects. The Robert Packer Hospital/Functional Pain Scale (RPH/FPS) was developed as a tool for the objective assessment of pain and its impact on a patient’s function. 
        Aim
        The study aimed to validate the RPH/FPS scale against NPS and Wong-Baker faces scale in medical, surgical, and trauma patients. The patients’ were also asked to rank the scales as one (1) being the most preferred to three (3) being the least preferred.
        Design
        This prospective, observational cohort study compares the two most common pain scales, the NPS and the Wong-Baker Faces, to the RPH/FPS.
        Methods
        Spearman correlation was used to test for correlation between the three scales, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare means between the RPH/FPS and NPS. The study participants were also asked to rate their preferences for the scales by rating the most preferred of the three scales as one (1) and the least preferred number three (3). 
        Results
        The RPH/FPS had a strong correlation with both the NPS and Wong-Baker Faces scales (RPH/FPS vs. NPS R=0.69, p<0.001: RPH-FPS vs. Wong-Baker Faces R=0.69, P<0.001). As for preferences, the RPH/FPS was ranked first on 36.9% of the surveys followed by NPS on 35.9%, and the Wong-Baker Faces on 22.3%. There were 4.9% of the surveys missing the preference rankings.
        Conclusion
        The results validate the RPH/FPS scale against the NPS and Wong-Baker Faces scales. This gives the clinicians a tool for objective assessment of pain and its effect on the recovery process, thereby minimizing the observed disconnect that sometimes happens between the reported pain intensity level and the providers' observation of the patient.",0
"The load transfer difficulty caused by borehole wall friction severely limits the penetration
rate and extended-reach limit of complex structural wells. A new friction reduction technology termed “earthworm-like drilling” is proposed in this paper to improve the load transfer of
complex structural wells. A mathematical model based on a “soft-string” model is developed
and solved. The results show that earthworm-like drilling is more effective than single-point
vibration drilling. The amplitude and frequency of the pulse pressure and the installation
position of the shakers have a substantial impact on friction reduction and load transfer. An
optimization model based on the projection gradient method is developed and used to optimize the position of three shakers in a horizontal well. The results verify the feasibility and
advantages of earthworm-like drilling, and establish a solid theoretical foundation for its
application in oil field drilling.",0
"Abstract—Peripheral chemoreflex is activated during short-term sustained hypoxia (SH), and the first synapse of
these afferents is located in Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS). NTS neurons projecting to the ventral lateral
medulla (NTS-VLM) are part of the respiratory pathways of the chemoreflex. SH increases the magnitude of basal
respiratory parameters in rats from Wistar-Hannover strain. In this study, we hypothesized that the observed
changes in the respiratory pattern in response to SH were due to changes in the GABAergic modulation of the
synaptic transmission of NTS-VLM neurons. We used an electrophysiological approach to record the synaptic
activity of NTS neurons labeled with a retrograde tracer previously microinjected into VLM of Wistar-Hannover
rats submitted to 24 h SH. The data are showing that: (a) the amplitude of evoked inhibitory currents in NTSVLM neurons of SH rats was reduced and not accompanied by any change in rise-time and decay-time; (b) the
1/CV2 and the number of failures in response to evoked currents were also affected by SH; (c) the frequency of
spontaneous inhibitory currents was reduced by SH without changes in amplitude and half-width. These effects
of SH were observed in NTS-VLM neurons located in caudal and intermediate NTS, but not in NTS-VLM neurons
located in the rostral NTS. We conclude that SH causes a reduction in inhibitory modulation onto NTS-VLM neurons by pre-synaptic mechanisms, which may contribute to the observed changes in the respiratory pattern of
Wistar-Hannover rats submitted to SH. _x0001_ 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Antiandrogens have demonstrated a protective effect for COVOD-19 patients in
observational and interventional studies. The goal of this study was to determine
if proxalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, could be an effective treatment
for men with COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. A randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at two outpatient centers (Brasilia, Brazil).
Patients were recruited from October 21 to December 24, 2020 (clinicaltrials.gov number,
NCT04446429). Male patients with confirmed COVID-19 but not requiring hospitalization
(COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale <3) were administered proxalutamide 200 mg/day or
placebo for up to 7 days. The primary endpoint was hospitalization rate at 30 days postrandomization. A total of 268 men were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. 134 patients receiving
proxalutamide and 134 receiving placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.2% in men taking proxalutamide compared to 26%
in placebo, P < 0.001. The 30-day hospitalization risk ratio was 0.09; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.03–0.27. Patients in the proxalutamide arm more frequently reported
gastrointestinal adverse events, however, no patient discontinued treatment. In placebo
group, 6 patients were lost during follow-up, and 2 patients died from acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Here we demonstrate the hospitalization rate in proxalutamide treated
men was reduced by 91% compared to usual care.",0
"Endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants are reported as potent producers of
diverse classes of secondary metabolites. In the present study, an endophytic fungi, Aspergillus clavatonanicus strain MJ31, exhibiting significant antimicrobial activity was isolated
from roots of Mirabilis jalapa L., was identified by sequencing three nuclear genes i.e. internal transcribed spacers ribosomal RNA (ITS rRNA), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA) and
translation elongation factor 1- alpha (EF 1Iˆ). Ethyl acetate extract of strain MJ31displayed
significant antimicrobial potential against Bacillus subtilis, followed by Micrococccus luteus
and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.078, 0.156
and 0.312 mg/ml respectively. In addition, the strain was evaluated for its ability to synthesize bioactive compounds by the amplification of polyketide synthase (PKS) and non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Further, seven antibiotics (miconazole,
ketoconazole, fluconazole, ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampicin) were
detected and quantified using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Additionally, thermal desorption-gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) analysis of strain MJ31 showed the presence of 28 volatile compounds. This is the first report on A. clavatonanicus as an endophyte
obtained from M. jalapa. We conclude that A. clavatonanicus strain MJ31 has prolific antimicrobial potential against both plant and human pathogens and can be exploited for the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds and could be an alternate source for the production
of secondary metabolites.",0
"Lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) is a histone H3 lysine 27
(H3K27) demethylase that serves as a key mediator of gene
transcription. Although KDM6B has been reported to modulate neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke, its role in
ischemic brain injury is yet to be well elucidated. Therefore,
this study aimed to thoroughly demonstrate the molecular
mechanism underlying the effect of KDM6B on neurological
function and astrocyte response in post-ischemic brain injury.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO) mouse
models were constructed, while the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model was developed in astrocytes
to mimic injury conditions. KDM6B was upregulated postMCAO in mice and in astrocytes following the induction of
OGD/R. Silencing of KDM6B resulted in suppressed neurological deficit, reduced cerebral infarction volume, attenuated
neuronal cell apoptosis, and disrupted inflammation. Dualluciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays revealed
that KDM6B inhibited H3K27 trimethylation in the interferon
regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) promoter region, resulting in the upregulation of IRF4 expression, which in turn bound to the
Notch2 promoter region to induce its downstream factor
SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (SOX9). SOX9 knockdown reversed the effects of KDM6B overexpression on
ischemia-triggered brain damage. Based on these findings, we
concluded that KDM6B-mediated demethylation of IRF4 contributes to aggravation of ischemic brain injury through SOX9
activation.",0
"Background and Aim: In the long-term prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic, parameters may change frequently for various
reasons, such as the emergence of mutant strains and changes in government policies. These changes will affect the efficiency of the
current emergency logistics network. Public health emergencies have typical unstructured characteristics such as blurred transmission
boundaries and dynamic time-varying scenarios, thus requiring continuous adjustment of emergency logistics network to adapt to the
actual situation and make a better rescue.
Practical Significance: The infectivity of public health emergencies has shown a tendency that it first increased and then decreased
in the initial decision-making cycle, and finally reached the lowest point in a certain decision-making cycle. This suggests that the
number of patients will peak at some point in the cycle, after which the public health emergency will then be brought under control and
be resolved. Therefore, in the design of emergency logistics network, the infectious ability of public health emergencies should be
fully considered (ie, the prediction of the number of susceptible population should be based on the real-time change of the infectious
ability of public health emergencies), so as to make the emergency logistics network more reasonable.
Methods: In this paper, we build a data-driven dynamic adjustment and optimization model for the decision-making framework with
an innovative emergency logistics network in this paper. The proposed model divides the response time to emergency into several
consecutive decision-making cycles, and each of them contains four repetitive steps: (1) analysis of public health emergency
transmission; (2) design of emergency logistics network; (3) data collection and processing; (4) adjustment and update of parameters.
Results: The result of the experiment shows that dynamic adjustment and update of parameters help to improve the accuracy of
describing the evolution of public health emergency transmission. The model successively transforms the public health emergency
response into the co-evolution of data learning and optimal allocation of resources.
Conclusion: Based on the above results, it is concluded that the model we designed in this paper can provide multiple real-time and
effective suggestions for policy adjustment in public health emergency management. When responding to other emergencies, our
model can offer helpful decision-making references.",0
"Atherosclerosis is one of the most common and crucial heart diseases involving the heart
and brain. At present, atherosclerosis and its major complications comprise the leading
causes of death worldwide. Our purpose was to identify the role of ciRS‐7 in atherosclerosis. Tubulogenesis of HMEC‐1 cell was evaluated utilizing tube formation assay. Cell
Counting Kit‐8 assay and flow cytometry were utilized to test viability and apoptosis.
Migration assay was utilized to determine the migration capacity of experimental cells.
Western blot was applied to examine apoptosis and tube formation‐associated protein
expression. In addition, the above experiments were repeated when silencing ciRS‐7,
overexpressing ciRS‐7, and upregulating miR‐26a‐5p. HMEC‐1 cells formed tube‐like
structures over time. Silencing ciRS‐7 suppressed viability, migration, and tube formation
but promoted apoptosis. Oppositely, overexpressing ciRS‐7 reversed the effect in
HMEC‐1 cells. miR‐26a‐5p expression was elevated by silencing ciRS‐7 and reduced by
overexpressing ciRS‐7. Moreover, overexpressing ciRS‐7 facilitated viability, migration,
and tube formation via upregulating miR‐26a‐5p. Conclusively, overexpressing ciRS‐7
mobilized phosphoinositide 3‐kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway and
suppressed c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 pathway. ciRS‐7 exerted influence on
apoptosis, viability, migration, and tube formation through mediating PI3K/AKT and
JNK/p38 pathways by miR‐26a‐5p downregulation in HMEC‐1 cells.",0
"MicroRNAs have been long considered synthesized endogenously until very recent discoveries showing that human can absorb dietary microRNAs from animal and plant origins
while the mechanism remains unknown. Compelling evidences of microRNAs from rice,
milk, and honeysuckle transported to human blood and tissues have created a high volume
of interests in the fundamental questions that which and how exogenous microRNAs can
be transferred into human circulation and possibly exert functions in humans. Here we present an integrated genomics and computational analysis to study the potential deciding features of transportable microRNAs. Specifically, we analyzed all publicly available
microRNAs, a total of 34,612 from 194 species, with 1,102 features derived from the microRNA sequence and structure. Through in-depth bioinformatics analysis, 8 groups of discriminative features have been used to characterize human circulating microRNAs and
infer the likelihood that a microRNA will get transferred into human circulation. For example,
345 dietary microRNAs have been predicted as highly transportable candidates where 117
of them have identical sequences with their homologs in human and 73 are known to be
associated with exosomes. Through a milk feeding experiment, we have validated 9 cowmilk microRNAs in human plasma using microRNA-sequencing analysis, including the top
ranked microRNAs such as bta-miR-487b, miR-181b, and miR-421. The implications in
health-related processes have been illustrated in the functional analysis. This work demonstrates the data-driven computational analysis is highly promising to study novel molecular
characteristics of transportable microRNAs while bypassing the complex mechanistic
details.",0
"Crohn’s disease is a chronic disease, which commonly affects women during their
reproductive years. Poorly treated Crohn’s disease is associated with adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Biologics, a group of therapeutic drugs targeting inflammatory mediators
including anti-TNF, anti-integrins and anti-interleukins, are increasingly used in pregnant
women with Crohn’s disease, exposing both the women and their fetuses to
treatment-related complications. At present, it is unclear which biologics are more
superior. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the
risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with Crohn’s disease after exposure
to biologics. Bibliographic databases were searched from inception to May 2021. The
outcomes of interest were preterm delivery, low birth weight, spontaneous abortion,
and congenital abnormalities. A total of 11 studies comprised of 1,875 pregnancies
among women with Crohn’s disease were included. Of these, 1,162 received biologics
and 713 received non-biologic therapy. During the remission phase of the disease, the
use of biological therapy increased the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, of which
anti-integrins were associated with a higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes
than anti-TNF and anti-interleukins",0
"The Wnt pathway is integrally involved in regulating self-renewal, proliferation, and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). We explored the effect of the Wnt antagonist, secreted
frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), in modulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
in CSCs from human glioblastoma cells lines, U87 and U373. sFRP4 chemo-sensitized
CSC-enriched cells to the most commonly used anti-glioblastoma drug, temozolomide
(TMZ), by the reversal of EMT. Cell movement, colony formation, and invasion in vitro were
suppressed by sFRP4+TMZ treatment, which correlated with the switch of expression of
markers from mesenchymal (Twist, Snail, N-cadherin) to epithelial (E-cadherin). sFRP4
treatment elicited activation of the Wnt-Ca2
+ pathway, which antagonizes the Wnt/ß-catenin
pathway. Significantly, the chemo-sensitization effect of sFRP4 was correlated with the reduction in the expression of drug resistance markers ABCG2, ABCC2, and ABCC4. The efficacy of sFRP4+TMZ treatment was demonstrated in vivo using nude mice, which showed
minimum tumor engraftment using CSCs pretreated with sFRP4+TMZ. These studies indicate that sFRP4 treatment would help to improve response to commonly used chemotherapeutics in gliomas by modulating EMT via the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. These findings could
be exploited for designing better targeted strategies to improve chemo-response and eventually eliminate glioblastoma CSCs.",0
"Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs in 5% to 18% of newborns. However, the underlying
inflammatory mechanisms have not been elucidated.
Methods: We established a mouse model of infection-associated PTB. Physical signs in pregnant
mice with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment were observed, and the frequencies of
Toll-like receptor (TLR)2- and TLR4-positive CD11bþ cells were analyzed. Cytokine levels in
plasma and pathological changes were assessed following LPS treatment. A rescue experiment
was used to probe potential immunologic mechanisms underlying PTB.
Results: Lymphocyte infiltration could be observed in the placentas of mice following intrauterine injection with LPS. The percentage of inflammatory cells decreased 12 hours after treatment.
Moreover, TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood cells was significantly increased
4 hours after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Peak TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral
blood cells occurred 8 hours post-treatment. TLR4 and TLR-2/4 inhibitors reduced levels of
interleukin-10, interferon-c, and tumor necrosis factor-a in peripheral blood and delayed PTB.
Conclusions: TLR2 and TLR4 inhibition could play important roles in PTB.",0
"COVID 19 is known to cause immune dysregulation and vitamin D is a known immunomodulator. This study aims to objectively investigate the impact of Pulse D therapy in reducing the inflammatory markers of COVID-19. Consented COVID-19 patients with hypovitaminosis D were evaluated for inflammatory markers (N/L ratio, CRP, LDH, IL6, Ferritin) along with vitamin D on 0th day and 9th/11th day as per their respective BMI category. Subjects were randomised into VD and NVD groups. VD group received Pulse D therapy (targeted daily supplementation of 60,000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 or 10 days depending upon their BMI) in addition to the standard treatment. NVD group received standard treatment alone. Differences in the variables between the two groups were analysed for statistical significance. Eighty seven out of one hundred and thirty subjects have completed the study (VD:44, NVD:43). Vitamin D level has increased from 16 ± 6 ng/ml to 89 ± 32 ng/ml after Pulse D therapy in VD group and highly significant (p < 0.01) reduction of all the measured inflammatory markers was noted. Reduction of markers in NVD group was insignificant (p > 0.05). The difference in the reduction of markers between the groups (NVD vs VD) was highly significant (p < 0.01). Therapeutic improvement in vitamin D to 80–100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 without any side effects. Hence, adjunctive Pulse D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19 for improved outcomes.",0
"The impairment of endothelial function by reduced endothelial
production of nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to the increased
risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients with
depression. NO also plays an essential role in the efficacy of
antidepressants. The present study aimed to confirm our previous preliminary findings using a larger sample and different
antidepressants. We enrolled 100 patients with major depressive
disorder (MDD) and 50 healthy controls. Patients were administered sertraline, duloxetine or mirtazapine and were followed up
for 8 weeks. We also compared the rate of increase in plasma
levels of metabolites of NO (NOx) among the three antidepressant treatments. Baseline plasma NOx levels were significantly
lower in the MDD group than in the control group. A negative
correlation was found between plasma NOx levels and the
severity of MDD. Treatment with duloxetine significantly
increased plasma NOx levels, whereas sertraline treatment
caused no significant increase.

"Summary
Background Magnesium sulphate given to women prior to very preterm birth protects the perinatal brain, so fewer
babies die or develop cerebral palsy. How magnesium sulphate exerts these beneficial effects remains uncertain.
The MagNUM Study aimed to assess the effect of exposure to antenatal magnesium sulphate on MRI measures of
brain white matter microstructure at term equivalent age.
Methods Nested cohort study within the Magnesium sulphate at 30 to <34 weeks’ Gestational age Neuroprotection Trial
(MAGENTA). Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12611000491965. Mothers at risk of preterm birth
at 30 to <34 weeks’ gestation were randomised to receive either 4 g of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate [8 mmol magnesium ions], or saline placebo, when preterm birth was planned or expected within 24 h. Participating babies underwent
diffusion tensor MRI at term equivalent age. The main outcomes were fractional anisotropy across the white matter tract
skeleton compared using Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), with adjustment for postmenstrual age at birth and at
MRI, and MRI site. Researchers and families were blind to treatment group allocation during data collection and analyses.
Findings Of the 109 babies the demographics of the 49 babies exposed to magnesium sulphate were similar to the
60 babies exposed to placebo. In babies whose mothers were allocated to magnesium sulphate, fractional anisotropy
was lower within the corticospinal tracts and corona radiata, the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and the
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi compared to babies whose mothers were allocated placebo (P < 0¢05).
Interpretation In babies born preterm after 30 weeks’ gestation, antenatal magnesium sulphate exposure did not promote development of white matter microstructure in pathways affecting motor or cognitive function. This suggests that
if the neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulphate treatment prior to preterm birth is confirmed at this gestation, the
mechanisms are not related to accelerated white matter maturation inferred from fractional anisotropy.
Funding This study was funded by a project grant from the Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC 14/153).

"Objective: Psychopathology in bariatric surgery patients may contribute
to adverse postoperative sequelae, including weight regain, substance
use, and self-harm. This cross-sectional study aimed to advance the understanding of the risk and protective paths through which weight bias
associates with depressive and anxiety symptoms in bariatric surgery
candidates (BSC).
Methods: BSC recruited from a surgical clinic (N=213, 82.2% women,
43 [SD 12] years, mean BMI: 49 [SD 9] kg/m2) completed measures of experienced weight bias (EWB), internalized weight bias (IWB), body and internalized shame, and self-compassion; anxiety and depression screeners
were accessed from medical charts. Multiple regression and PROCESS
bootstrapping estimates tested our hypothesized mediation model as follows: EWB→IWB→body shame→shame→self-compassion→symptoms.
Results: After accounting for EWB and IWB, internalized shame accounted for greater variance in both end points than body shame. EWB
was associated with greater anxiety through risk paths implicating IWB,
body shame, and/or internalized shame. Protective paths associated
EWB with fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms among those with
higher self-compassion.
Conclusions: The findings suggest a potentially important role for weight
bias and shame in psychological health among BSC and implicate selfcompassion, a trainable affect-regulation strategy, as a protective factor
that may confer some resiliency. Future research using longitudinal and
causal designs is warranted.",0

Methods: PCOS rat model was established by dehydroepiandrosterone induction. NEAT1, miR-381 and IGF1 expression in ovarian granulosa cells of PCOS patients and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were tested. Bioinformatics website
and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were utilized to verify the relationship between NEAT1 and miR-381 and that
between miR-381 and IGF1. Levels of sex hormone, pathological changes and ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in
ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were detected. Ovarian granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed in vitro.
Results: NEAT1 and IGF1 expression increased while miR-381 expression decreased in the ovarian granulosa cells of
patients with PCOS and the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vivo experiments, interference with NEAT1 improved
the levels of sex hormones, alleviated pathological changes and suppressed ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in the
ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vitro cell experiments, interference with NEAT1 suppressed apoptosis and enhanced
cell proliferation of ovarian granulosa cells. NEAT1 interference-mediated efect would be reversed by up-regulating
miR-381. NEAT1 acted as a ceRNA to adsorb miR-381 to target IGF1. Overexpression of IGF1 reversed the inhibitory
efect of miR-381 on ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis.
Conclusion: Interference with NEAT1 increases miR-381 and reduces IGF1 levels, efectively improving the levels of
sex hormones and reducing the pathological damage of ovarian tissue in rats with PCOS.

" Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpetic virus, which infects 45–100% people worldwide. Many reports suggest that CMV could impair cognitive functions of infected subjects. Here we searched for indices of effects of CMV on infected subjects’ intelligence and knowledge. The Intelligence Structure Test I-S-T 2000 R was used to compare IQ of 148 CMV-infected and 135 CMV-free university students. Infected students expressed higher intelligence. Paradoxically, their IQ decreased with decreasing concentration of anti-CMV antibodies, which can be used, statistically, as a proxy of the time passed from the moment of infection in young subjects when the age of subjects is statistically controlled. The paradox of seemingly higher intelligence of CMV infected subjects could be explained by the presence of the subpopulation of about 5–10% CMV-positive individuals in the population of “CMV-negative students”. These false negative subjects had probably not only the oldest infections and therefore the lowest concentration of anamnestic antibodies, but also the lowest intelligence among the infected students. Prevalence of CMV infection in all countries is very high, approaching sometimes 90%. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human intelligence may be large.",0
"Objective. To assess if body mass index (BMI) and high waist circumference (HWC) are associated with testing positive for the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods. 9,386 UK Biobank study participants tested for SARSCoV-2 from March 16th 2020 to June 29th 2020 were analyzed. A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted
risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction
between age and HWC. Results. Approximately 17% (n � 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had
a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR � 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17). For
participants ≥65 years, only obesity class II (RR � 1.38, 95% CI 1.10–1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight. While HWC was not associated with testing positive for SARSCoV-2 in those <65 years, having an HWC was associated with an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in participants ≥65 years (RR � 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.27). Conclusion. &e associations of BMI and HWC with testing positive for SARSCoV-2 differed by age. Notably, HWC was associated with testing positive in those ≥65 years, but not those who were younger,
independent of BMI. &is suggests that measures of adiposity in addition to BMI may be used to identify older individuals at
greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.",0
"Aims: Echinacoside (ECH) is a natural compound extracted from the stem of the Cistanche deserticola plant, has
significant biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-tumor, hep
atoprotective, and immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we aimed to explore the protection effects and
mechanisms of ECH on diabetic liver injury in db/db mice.
Main methods: Overall, 6-week-old db/db mice (n = 20) were randomly allocated to 2 groups: diabetic model
group (db/db group, intragastric administration of normal saline, n = 10) and ECH-treated group (db/db + ECH
group, n = 10). Additionally, the normal control group comprised 6-week-old db/m mice (db/m group, normal
saline intragastric administration, n = 10). ECH was administered once a day for 10 weeks. Weight and fasting
blood glucose (FBG) were measured biweekly. HE staining and Oil O staining were used to evaluate liver tissue
pathological changes and lipid accumulation respectively. Immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and RTPCR analysis were used to detect the expression of components of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling axis.
Key findings: The results showed that the administration of echinacoside for 10 weeks could significantly improve
liver injury and insulin resistance in db/db mice (p < 0.01). Also, echinacoside treatment helped to reduce blood
lipids and blood glucose (p < 0.01). Moreover, ECH actived AMPK/SIRT1 signaling, upregulated peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα),
carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1A (CPT1A) in db/db mice (p < 0.01).
Significance: The effect of ECH may be elicited by the activation of the liver AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and its
downstream factors to improve adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.",0

          Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are associated with increased cardiovascular risk when higher doses are used toward higher hematocrit targets. Patients new to dialysis are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. Systematic evaluation of this population was predefined in the roxadustat clinical development program. Roxadustat is a hypoxia-inducible prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor.
          Methods
          Data were pooled from 3 phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials. Eligible adults had kidney failure and initiated dialysis for 2 weeks to ≤ 4 months prior to randomization to roxadustat or epoetin alfa. Efficacy was assessed as mean change in hemoglobin from baseline averaged over weeks 28 to 52, regardless of rescue therapy. Key cardiovascular safety endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; all-cause mortality [ACM], myocardial infarction, and stroke), and MACE+ (MACE plus unstable angina or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization), and ACM.
          Results
          This study included 1530 patients with kidney failure incident to dialysis. Mean (SD) changes in hemoglobin from baseline averaged over weeks 28 to 52, regardless of rescue therapy, were 2.12 (1.45) versus 1.91 (1.42) g/dl in the roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups (least-squares mean difference: 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.40; P = 0.0130). Risks of MACE and MACE+ were lower in the roxadustat group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96) than the epoetin alfa group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.89); the HR for ACM was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.11).
        
        
          Conclusion
          Roxadustat was at least as efficacious as epoetin alfa. Roxadustat had a lower risk of MACE/MACE+ in patients new to dialysis.

"The survival of microglia depends on the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling pathway under physiological conditions.
Ki20227 is a highly selective CSF1R inhibitor that has been shown to change the morphology of microglia. However, the effects of Ki20227 on
the progression of ischemic stroke are unclear. In this study, male C57BL/6 mouse models of focal cerebral ischemic injury were established
through the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and then administered 3 mg/g Ki20227 for 3 successive days. The results revealed that
the number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1/bromodeoxyuridine double positive cells in the infarct tissue was reduced, the
degree of edema was increased, neurological deficits were aggravated, infarct volume was increased, and the number of peri-infarct Nissl
bodies was reduced. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells in the peri-infarct tissue was
increased. The expression levels of Bax and Cleaved caspase-3 were up-regulated. Bcl-2 expression was downregulated. The expression levels
of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-associated factors were increased. These findings suggested that Ki20227 blocked microglial
proliferation and aggravated the pathological progression of ischemia/reperfusion injury in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
model. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Lanzhou University Second Hospital (approval No. D2020-68) on March 6,

"Renal interstitial fibrosis is a key factor in the development of chronic renal
diseases, possibly leading to uremia. The present study conducted aimed to assess
the hypothesis whether keratin 1 (KRT1) silencing could suppress kidney
interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis via the Notch pathway to alleviate
uremic symptoms. Differentially expressed genes associated with uremia were
identified using the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Uremic rat models
were established, in which short hairpin‐RNA against KRT1, activators, and
inhibitors of the Notch pathway were transfected. To further validate the
mechanism of KRT1 in uremia, KRT1 expression, cell apoptosis, glomerular area
(GA), and glomerular capillary volume (GV), the score of glomerular sclerosis, and
tubulointerstitial injury were assayed and investigated. GEO database revealed
that KRT1 was upregulated in uremia and regulated the Notch pathway. GA, GV,
cell apoptosis, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury were typically
located in more elevated levels of uremia in rats. KRT1 silencing and Notch
pathway inhibition decreased the expression of Jagged1, Notch1, NICD1, Hey1,
Hes1, α‐SMA, and FN, which further resulted in decreased cell apoptosis, GA, GV,
the score of glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury. Subsequently,
the effect of KRT1 silencing on uremia was no longer evident once the Notch
pathway was activated. The co‐localization of high expression KRT1 and Notch1
was found in uremia. In summary, the results identified KRT1 as a key regulator in
uremia progression, and KRT1 silencing can suppress glomerular sclerosis and
tubulointerstitial injury via inactivation of the Notch pathway in uremic rats.",0
"Retinoblastoma is an ocular malignancy occurring in childhood. The current
study evaluates the ability of silenced PRC1 on retinoblastoma cell proliferation,
and angiogenesis via the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. A total of 36 cases of
retinoblastoma tissues (n = 36) and normal retinal tissues (n = 10) were selected
in the current study. Retinoblastoma cells presenting with the high PRC1
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were selected among the WERI‐Rb‐1,
HXO‐RB44, Y79, SO‐Rb50, and SO‐Rb70 cells lines, and were transfected with
siRNA‐PRC1 and LiCl (the activator of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway). The
expressions of PRC1, VEGF, Wnt1, β‐catenin, CyclinD1, extent of β‐catenin,
and GSK‐3β phosphorylation were evaluated. Cell proliferation, cell‐cycle
distribution, and cell invasion of retinoblastoma cells were evaluated by
3‐(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, and Transwell assay. The angiogenesis of retinoblastoma cells was
detected by tube formation assay. HXO‐RB44 and WERI‐Rb‐1 cells were
selected owing to the highest PRC1 mRNA expression. Meanwhile, PRC2 gene
silencing presented lower expression levels of PRC1, VEGF, Wnt1, β‐catenin,
CyclinD1, extent of β‐catenin and GSK‐3β phosphorylation, decreased
proliferation and invasion abilities, extended G0/G1 phase, and shortened S
and G2/M phases of HXO‐RB44 and WERI‐Rb‐1 cells, suggesting the silenced
PRC2 inactivated Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, so as to further restrain the
retinoblastoma cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. These results
support the view that PRC1 gene silencing could suppress the proliferation, and
angiogenesis of retinoblastoma cells by repressing the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway.",0
"Long noncoding RNA Breast Cancer Antiestrogen Resistance 4 (BCAR4) has been
identified to be oncogenic in several cancers. In our study, we demonstrated that
BCAR4 expression was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared with
paired nontumor tissues. In addition, higher BCAR4 level was associated with poor
overall survival in patients with glioma. Besides, we also discovered that knockdown
of BCAR4 inhibited cell proliferation, whereas BCAR4 overexpression promoted this
process. Intriguingly, we proved a cellular transformation of normal human astrocyte
cells (NHAs) in response to enforced expression of BCAR4. In addition, we revealed
that BCAR4 affected cell proliferation in glioma cells by promoting cell cycle
progression and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we uncovered that BCAR4
activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in glioma through upregulating EGFR and
interacting with it. Moreover, activating PI3K/AKT pathway could reverse the
repressive effects caused by BCAR4 silence on the biological behaviors of glioma
cells, whereas inhibition of this pathway rescued the impact of BACR4 upregulation in
NHAs. These findings disclosed that BCAR4 contributes to glioma progression by
enhancing cell growth via activating EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, providing potent
evidence that BCAR4 could be an effective new target for treatment and prognosis of
glioma patients",0
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the commonest human cancers and the fourth
primary cause of cancer‐related death. Previous studies have reported that miR‐
4429 develops anticancer function in follicular thyroid carcinoma and non‐small cell
lung cancer. However, whether miR‐4429 is implicated in the CRC progression
remains to be clarified. The aim of our current study was to explore the potential
role of miR‐4429 in CRC. According to the result of quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction analysis, miR‐4429 was expressed at a low level in CRC cells.
Gain‐of‐function assays showed that the upregulation of miR‐4429 inhibited cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
process in CRC, whereas miR‐4429 inhibition led to the opposite results. It was
uncovered from mechanism experiments that miR‐4429 targeted forkhead box M1
(FOXM1) and therefore regulating SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) expression.
Rescue experiments elucidated that miR‐4429 influenced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT process in CRC by targeting FOXM1 to inactivate SMAD3.
In conclusion, our study revealed that miR‐4429 targeted FOXM1 to decrease
SMAD3 expression and thus impeding cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
EMT process of CRC cells.",0
"Uremia largely results from the accumulation of organic waste products normally
cleared by the kidneys, which commonly accompanies kidney failure and chronic
kidney disease. However, genetic investigations in a uremia remain largely unclear.
This study aimed to determine the expression patterns of distal‐less homeobox 5
(DLX5) in uremia rat model and further to study its effects on glomerulosclerosis and
interstitial fibrosis. Uremic expression chip was applied to screen differentially
expressed genes in uremia. Next, we used small interfering RNA‐mediated RNA
interference to specifically silence DLX5 in experimental uremic rats to understand
the regulatory mechanism of DLX5. To understand effect of Notch1 signaling
pathway in uremia, we also treated experimental uremic rats with γ‐secretase
inhibitor (GSI), an inhibitor of Notch1 signaling pathway. The expression of
fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN), transforming growth factor‐β1 (TGF‐β1), Hes1, Hes5,
and Jagged2 was determined. The semiquantitative assessment was applied to verify
the effects of DLX5 on glomerulosclerosis. In the uremic expression chip, we found
that DLX5 was upregulated in uremia samples, and considered to regulate the Notch
signaling pathway. We found that small interfering RNA‐mediated DLX5 inhibition or
Notch1 signaling pathway inhibitory treatment relieved and delayed the kidney injury
and glomerulosclerosis in uremia. Meanwhile, inhibition of DLX5 or Nothch1 signaling
pathway reduced expression of FN, LN, Nothch1, TGF‐β1, Hes1, Hes5, and Jagged2.
Intriguingly, we discovered that Notch1 signaling pathway was inhibited after
silencing DLX5. In conclusion, these findings highlight that DLX5 regulates Notch
signaling, which may, in turn, promote complications of uremia such as kidney fibrosis,
providing a novel therapeutic target for treating uremia.",0
"Cardiac rupture and ventricular remodeling are recognized as the severe complications and major risk factors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study aims to
evaluate the regulatory roles of interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase 3 (IRAK3)
and nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) signaling pathway in cardiac rupture and ventricular
remodeling. Microarray analysis was performed to screen AMI‐related differentially
expressed genes and IRAK3 was identified. The models of AMI were established in
male C57BL/6 mice to investigate the functional role of IRAK3. Afterwards, lentivirus
recombinant plasmid si‐IRAK3 was constructed for IRAK3 silencing. Next, cardiac
function parameters were measured in response to IRAK3 silencing. The regulatory
effects that IRAK3 had on myocardial infarct size and the content of myocardial
interstitial collagen were analyzed. The regulation of IRAK3 silencing on the NF‐κB
signaling pathway was further assayed. The obtained results indicated that highly
expressed IRAK3 and activated NF‐κB signaling pathway were observed in
myocardial tissues of mouse models of AMI, accompanied by increased expression
of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐2/9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2
(TIMP‐2). Notably, IRAK3 gene silencing inhibited the activation of NF‐κB signaling
pathway. Furthermore, IRAK3 gene silencing led to the decreased thickness of infarct
area and collagen content of myocardial interstitium, alleviated diastolic, and systolic
dysfunctions, as well as, facilitated cardiac functions in mice with AMI, corresponding
to decreased expression of MMP‐2/9 expression and increased expression of TIMP‐2.
Taken together, silencing of IRAK3 inactivates the NF‐κB signaling pathway, and
thereby impeding the cardiac rupture and ventricular remodeling, which eventually
prevents AMI progression.",0
"Purpose: Investigation of surface dose rate variation with respect to the source configuration of 106Ru/106Rh eye
plaque. To explore an alternate way to determine activity of brachytherapy plaques.
Methods: The surface dose rates of 106Ru/106Rh plaque developed indigenously were measured by extrapolation
chamber. To rule out possibility of any error in the activity distribution and quantity, same source was used in
two different configurations namely planar and curved. EBT3 Gafchromic film was used for determination of
uniformity in activity. Monte Carlo-based Codes EGSnrc and FLUKA were used to calculate dose rate in tissue,
percentage depth dose and for determination of activity. Parameters and correction factors were estimated using
simulations.
Results: The measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved 106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to
be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28 mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate of
curved eye plaque is about ~5% as compared to planar configuration.
The FLUKA-calculated dose values are almost independent of cavity length of the extrapolation chamber for both
eye plaques. The FLUKA-based dose rates per μCi 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08 mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06
mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye plaques which match well with the measurements. The calculated
activities for planar and curved eye plaques are 34.08 μCi and 33.98 μCi, respectively.
Conclusions: Surface dose rates for a prototype 106Ru/106Rh eye plaque with different configurations were esti
mated using simulations and measured experimentally. An alternate way to determine activity of beta-gamma
brachytherapy plaque has been proposed.",0

          Purpose
          This study aims to compare the efficacy of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) versus conventional TACE (cTACE), both combined with apatinib, and to establish predictive nomograms to support individualized survival prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
        
        
          Patients and Methods
          This retrospective study assessed HCC patients from June 2015 to December 2019. Patients were classified as DEB-TACE plus apatinib (D-apatinib) and cTACE plus apatinib (c-apatinib). The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The nomograms were constructed, and the C-index, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration curves were used to validate the nomograms. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was applied to reduce patient selection bias.
        
        
          Results
          A total of 174 patients were included. After PSM analysis, 58 pairs of patients were selected. Before PSM analysis, the median OS and PFS were 21.0 and 8.0 months in the D-apatinib group, respectively, which were better than the 18.0 and 5.0 months observed in the c-apatinib group (P < 0.05). The complete response (CR) rate and objective response rate (ORR) of the D-apatinib group were higher than those of the c-apatinib group. The C-index values of the nomograms in the D-apatinib group and the c-apatinib group were 0.826 and 0.802, and the area under the curve (AUC) values in the ROC curve were 0.934 and 0.892. After PSM analysis, the survival of patients treated with D-apatinib was better than that of patients treated with c-apatinib (P < 0.05). The C-index values were 0.854 and 0.794 in the D-apatinib group and the c-apatinib group, respectively, and the AUC values were 0.960 and 0.890. The incidence of adverse events was higher in the c-apatinib group.
        
        
          Conclusion
          DEB-TACE in combination with apatinib showed better treatment effectiveness for unresectable HCC. The nomograms can identify HCC patients who may benefit most from the treatment.

" Background: The use of robotic surgery in bariatric patients is controversial.
Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of robotic surgery in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)
patients.
Setting: Tertiary-care referral hospital.
Methods: A total of 149,132 patients who underwent RYGB in the 2015 to 2018 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database were included
in our initial analysis. The propensity-matched analysis that was performed resulted in 21,736 patients, whose data were utilized to compare outcomes of the robotic (R) and laparoscopic (L) groups.
Patients were also compared after dividing them into obese (body mass index [BMI] , 50 kg/m2
) and
super-obese categories (BMI _x0001_ 50 kg/m2
).
Results: R-RYGB patients had a significantly lower 30-day incidence of serious adverse events
(SAEs) and bleeding (2.0% and .7%, respectively, for R-RYGB versus 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively,
for L-RYGB; P  .05) but a higher incidence of 30-day reoperation compared to L-RYGB patients
(2.7% versus 2.3%, respectively; P .05). The R-RYGB group also had a shorter length of hospital
stay compared to the L-RYGB group (1.98 versus 2.02 days, respectively; P .05), but higher readmission rates (7.1% versus 5.8%, respectively; P .05). The robotic approach also resulted in lower
mortality rates for those in the super-obese category. In that BMI category, 30-day mortality rates
were .4% versus .2% for L-RYGB and R-RYGB patients, respectively (P  .05).
Conclusion: The use of robotic surgery in bariatric patients is controversial. Our analysis, based on the
MBSAQIP database for the years 2015 to 2018, demonstrated lower overall SAEs and bleeding rates, in
addition to a shorter hospital stay, favoring robotic RYGB compared to laparoscopic RYGB. However, readmission and reoperation rates were higher in the robotic group. Randomized controlled trials are needed to
further clarify the benefit of robotic surgery in bariatric patients. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2021;17:694–

"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Skin cancer severely threatens the public health. Dual-specificity
protein phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) characterizes
with multiple roles regulating cell growth, proliferation and gaining. This study aims to investigate the regulatory role of DUSP22 on aging of
skin cancer cells and clarify molecular mechanisms, along with potential application value.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: HS-1 skin cancer
cells were transfected with DUSP22 by liposome
transfection approach. Western blot assay was
used to evaluate the effects of DUSP22 on aging
protein of HS-1 cells, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK)
signal pathway. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and
Western blot assay were used to examine the
DUSP22 expression in HS-1 cancer cells. Meanwhile, the correlation between P53 protein and
aging was also investigated.
RESULTS: Transfection of DUSP22 plasmid
significantly elevated DUSP22 expression in HS1 skin cancer cells compared to un-transfected
cells (p<0.05), and activated MAPK to induce cell
aging. Transfection of small interfere RNA (siRNA) DUSP22 significantly suppressed DUSP22
expression in HS-1 cancer cells, inhibited MAPK
signal pathway, and decreased aging proteins
P53 and P21 compared to the untreated group
(p<0.05). DUSP22 was downregulated in HS-1
skin cancer cells, with MAPK signal pathway
inhibition, and lower aging protein P53 expression. DUSP22 expression was positively correlated with aging protein P53 (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DUSP22 facilitated HS-1
skin cancer cell aging via activating MAPK signal pathway, possibly providing novel strategy

"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Vascular dementia
(VD) is a type of memory, cognition, and behavior disorder caused by ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. It is a common pathogenesis of
dementia that is only second to Alzheimer’s disease. Inflammation plays a key role in VD. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a kind of pro-inflammatory cytokine, while its mechanism in VD occurrence and
development is still unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The healthy male
rats were randomly divided into three groups, including sham group, VD model group (established by bilateral common carotid artery ligation),
and IL-1β group (treated by IL-1β monoclonal antibody intracerebroventricular injection on based
on model group). Rat learning ability was evaluated by Morris water maze assay. IL-1β expression
in brain tissue and peripheral blood was examined
by using Real Time-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Hippocampus apoptosis was detected by caspase 3 activity detection kit. B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein levels were assessed by Western blot assay.
RESULTS: IL-1β expression was increased,
caspase 3 activity was enhanced, Bcl-2 level
was declined, and p-P38 phosphorylation was
elevated in brain tissue and peripheral blood
from VD model group compared to sham group
(p<0.05). IL-1β monoclonal antibody significantly reduced IL-1β expression, improved learning
ability, attenuated caspase 3 activity, increased
Bcl-2 level, and declined p-P38 expression in VD
rats compared to model group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-1β can delay VD occurrence and development through the P38-MAPK
signaling pathway to regulate cell apoptosis and
improve learning ability",0
"The performance of the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) approach to simulate typical photodissociation processes is assessed. The correct description of photodissociation requires the calculation of correlation functions or expectation values associated with nonequilibrium initial conditions, which was shown to be possible with RPMD very recently [J.

This approach is combined with treatment of the nonadiabatic dynamics employing the ring polymer surface hopping approach (RPSH), which is based on Tully’s fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) approach. The performance is tested using one-dimensional photodissociation models. It is found that RPSH with non-equilibrium initial conditions can well reproduce the time-dependent dissociation probability, and adiabatic and diabatic populations for cases where the crossing point is below and above the Franck-Condon point, respectively, while standard FSSH fails to reproduce the exact quantum dynamics in the latter case. Thus, it is shown that RPSH is an efficient and accurate alternative to standard FSSH, which is one of the most widely employed approaches to study photochemistry.

"Background: Apoptosis and oxidative stress are the main etiology of age related cataract (ARC). This article aims to
investigate the role of WRN in lens epithelial cells (LECs).
Methods: We estimated the methylation level of WRN in anterior lens capsule tissues of ARC patients. SRA01/04 (LECs)
cells were treated with H2O2 or combined with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) or chloroquine. CCK8 and flow
cytometry were performed to explore proliferation and apoptosis. The content of ROS was detected by fluorescent
probe DCFH-DA. The gene and protein expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR or western blot.
Results: WRN was down-regulated and the methylation level of WRN was increased in the anterior lens capsule
tissues. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR enhanced proliferation and repressed apoptosis and oxidative stress of
SRA01/04 cells. 5-Aza-CdR enhanced WRN expression. WRN knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis
and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells, which was rescued by 5-Aza-CdR. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR repressed
ATM/p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, chloroquine inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative
stress of SRA01/04 cells by activating ATM/p53 signaling pathway. The influence conferred by chloroquine was
abolished by WRN overexpression.
Conclusion: Our study reveals that DNA methylation mediated WRN inhibits apoptosis and oxidative stress of human
LECs through ATM/p53 signaling pathway.

"Objective: This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies on COVID-19.
Methods: Relevant literatures about GM-CSF antibody treatment in COVID-19 patients were
searched from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google scholar, and Baiduscholar
databases from the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 until 1 January 2021. The primary
outcomes included the death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission risk, ventilation requirement,
and secondary infection.
Results: A total of 12 eligible literature involving 8979 COVID-19 patients were recruited,
and they were divided into experimental group (n=2673) and control group (n=6306). Using a
random-effect model, it is found that the GM-CSF antibody treatment was associated with a
23% decline of the risk of death [odd’s ratio (OR): 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21–0.56,
p<0.0001] and a 20% enhancement of ventilation (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.80, p=0.0002).
GM-CSF antibody treatment did not have a significant correlation to secondary infection and
increased risk of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients, which may be attributed to the older age
and the length of stay.
Conclusions: Severe COVID-19 patients can benefit from GM-CSF antibodies",0
"No specifc antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efcacy
of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19. This was a multicenter randomized controlled study including 96 patients with
COVID- 19 who were randomly assigned into a chloroquine (CQ) group and a favipiravir group. None of the patients in the
favipiravir group needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.129). One patient (2.3%) in the favipiravir group and two patients
(4.2%) in the CQ group died (p = 1.00). Favipiravir is a promising drug for COVID-19 that decreases the hospital stay and
the need for mechanical ventilation.

"Circadian rhythms modulate the biology of many human tissues, including brain tissues, and are driven by a near 24-hour
transcriptional feedback loop. These rhythms are paralleled by 24-hour rhythms of large portions of the transcriptome. The
role of dynamic DNA methylation in influencing these rhythms is uncertain. While recent work in Neurospora suggests that
dynamic site-specific circadian rhythms of DNA methylation may play a role in modulating the fungal molecular clock, such
rhythms and their relationship to RNA expression have not, to our knowledge, been elucidated in mammalian tissues,
including human brain tissues. We hypothesized that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation exist in the human brain, and
play a role in driving 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in post-mortem human
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 738 subjects. We assessed for 24-hour rhythmicity of 420,132 DNA methylation
sites throughout the genome by considering methylation levels as a function of clock time of death and parameterizing
these data using cosine functions. We determined global statistical significance by permutation. We then related rhythms of
DNA methylation with rhythms of RNA expression determined by RNA sequencing. We found evidence of significant 24-
hour rhythmicity of DNA methylation. Regions near transcription start sites were enriched for high-amplitude rhythmic DNA
methylation sites, which were in turn time locked to 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression of nearby genes, with the nadir of
methylation preceding peak transcript expression by 1–3 hours. Weak ante-mortem rest-activity rhythms were associated
with lower amplitude DNA methylation rhythms as were older age and the presence of Alzheimer’s disease. These findings
support the hypothesis that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation, particularly near transcription start sites, may play a role
in driving 24-hour rhythms of gene expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and may be affected by age and
Alzheimer’s disease.",0
"Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder, but the
mechanisms that underlie this are not well characterized. Here, we show that kappa opioid
receptor signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical molecular substrate
underlying abnormal stress responses to predator odor following heavy alcohol drinking. Exposure
to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in
enhanced prefrontal cortex (PFC)-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the
BNST. Furthermore, deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFCBNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice. These
findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral
responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal. Various nodes of this PFC-BNST
dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well
as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking.",0
": In order to assist the refolding of recombinant
nitrilase inclusion bodies, a series of thermoresponsive media were
prepared by grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl-methacrylate) [P(NIPAM-co-BMA)] brushes onto PS microspheres with
various particles and pore sizes via an atom transfer radical
polymerization (ATRP) method. The effects of particle sizes, pore
sizes, and brush grafting amounts of thermoresponsive microspheres on nitrilase refolding were investigated preliminarily. The
results showed that the PS-P(NIPAM-co-BMA) microspheres with
the medium particle size (74 μm), gigapore size (320 nm), and
high grafting amount (35.6 mg/m2
) were the most effective candidates. The final nitrilase activity yield could be up to 84.5% with a
high initial protein concentration (1 mg/mL) at 30 °C, which was 52.5% higher than that of a simple dilution refolding method at
the initial protein concentration (0.1 mg/mL). After the refolding process, the PS-P(NIPAM-co-BMA) microspheres can be easily
separated by self-precipitation, and the activity yield of nitrilase still reached 74.5% after being reused for five batches. These results
indicated that the thermoresponsive gigaporous medium was an ideal alternative as an artificial chaperone.",0
"In humans, one of the major factors associated with infective endocarditis (IE) is the concurrent presence of periodontal disease (PD). However, in veterinary medicine, the relevance
of PD in the evolution of dogs’ endocarditis remains poorly understood. In order to try to
establish a correlation between mouth-associated Enterococcus spp. and infective endocarditis in dogs, the present study evaluated the presence and diversity of enterococci in
the gum and heart of dogs with PD. Samples were collected during necropsy of 32 dogs
with PD and visually diagnosed with IE, which died of natural causes or euthanasia. Enterococci were isolated, identified and further characterized by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE); susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and pathogenicity potential was also
evaluated. In seven sampled animals, PFGE-patterns, resistance and virulence profiles
were found to be identical between mouth and heart enterococci obtained from the same
dog, allowing the establishment of an association between enterococcal periodontal disease and endocarditis in dogs. These findings represent a crucial step towards understanding the pathogenesis of PD-driven IE, and constitute a major progress in veterinary
medicine.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Tumor-derived exosomes have been repeatedly studied as tumor antigens, suppressing T-cell signaling molecules and promoting apoptosis in ovarian cancer (OC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
have been recognized as major regulators in tumorigenesis, including OC. For this study, we
try to find out the mechanism of exosomes and
lncRNA FAL1 in OC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the extraction and identification of exosomes, the internalization of exosomes was observed. Invasion and migration experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of SKOV3 cells-secreted exosomes on OC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, the in vivo findings were
verified via xenograft tumors in nude mice. FAL1
was knocked out on exosomes. OC cells treated
with exosomes were co-cultured with lncRNA
FAL1 or/and PTEN to measure cell invasion and
migration.
RESULTS: SKOV3-secreted exosomes were
absorbed and internalized by OC cells. After
exosome treatment, the migration and invasion of OC cells were enhanced, tumors in
nude mice were larger and heavier, metastasis was increased, and lncRNA FAL1 expression was increased. When lncRNA FAL1 was
knocked out, the promoting effects of SKOV3
cells-secreted exosomes on OC cell metastasis were weakened, along with increased PTEN
level and decreased AKT phosphorylation level. In HO-8910PM cells treated with siRNA-FAL1
exosomes and siRNA-PTEN, cell invasion and
migration, and AKT phosphorylation were restored.
CONCLUSIONS: SKOV3-secreted exosomes
inhibited the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway by
transferring lncRNA FAL1, thus inhibiting OC
cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo.",0

        Molecular crystals are not known to be as stiff as metals, composites and ceramics. Here we report an exceptional mechanical stiffness and high hardness in a known elastically bendable organic cocrystal [caffeine (CAF), 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid (CNB) and methanol (1:1:1)] which is comparable to certain low-density metals. Spatially resolved atomic level studies reveal that the mechanically interlocked weak hydrogen bond networks which are separated by dispersive interactions give rise to these mechanical properties. Upon bending, the crystals significantly conserve the overall energy by efficient redistribution of stress while perturbations in hydrogen bonds are compensated by strengthened π-stacking. Furthermore we report a remarkable stiffening and hardening in the elastically bent crystal. Hence, mechanically interlocked architectures provide an unexplored route to reach new mechanical limits and adaptability in organic crystals. This proof of concept inspires the design of light-weight, stiff crystalline organics with potential to rival certain inorganics, which currently seem inconceivable.

          To compare the efficacy and complications between reconstruction nail and hollow screw+plate in patients with femoral shaft and femoral neck fracture.
        
        
          Methods
          The full text of studies on clinical efficacy involving reconstruction nail and hollow screw+plate was retrieved from multiple databases. Review Manager 5.0 was adopted for meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted with respect to the operation time, blood loss, healing time of the femoral shaft, healing time of the femoral neck, and complications. Finally, 10 studies met the eligibility criteria, including 991 patients.
        
        
          Results
          The meta-analysis suggested better characteristics for the reconstruction nail compared with the hollow screw+plate regarding operation time (OR = − 82.41, 95% CI [− 91.72, − 73.10], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity < 0.00001, I2 = 98%), blood loss (OR = − 388.01, 95% CI [− 422.95, − 353.06], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity < 0.00001, I2 = 99%), healing time of femoral shaft (MD = − 3.89, 95% CI [− 4.74, − 3.05], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity < 0.00001, I2 = 99%), healing time of femoral neck (MD = − 4.04, 95% CI [− 4.33, − 3.75], P < 0.00001; P for heterogeneity = 0.008, I2 = 60%), and complications (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.31, 0.73], P = 0.0006; P for heterogeneity = 1.00, I2 = 0%).

"The present study examined the roles of word concreteness and word valence in
the immediate serial recall task. Emotion words (e.g. happy) were used to investigate
these effects. Participants completed study-test trials with seven-item study lists
consisting of positive or negative words with either high or low concreteness
(Experiments 1 and 2) and neutral (i.e. non-emotion) words with either high or low
concreteness (Experiment 2). For neutral words, the typical word concreteness
effect (concrete words are better recalled than abstract words) was replicated. For
emotion words, the effect occurred for positive words, but not for negative
words. While the word concreteness effect was stronger for neutral words than
for negative words, it was not different for the neutral words and the positive
words. We conclude that both word valence and word concreteness simultaneously
contribute to the item and order retention of emotion words and discuss
how Hulme et al.’s (1997) item redintegration account can be modified to explain
these findings.",0
"In English, unfair treatment and social injustice are often described as “bitter”
experiences, but in Chinese “eating bitterness” refers to endurance in the face of
hardship. We tested the influence of these metaphors by assessing Canadian and
Chinese participants’ responses to a fairness and an achievement scenario after
incidental exposure to a bitter, sweet or neutral taste. A bitter taste experience
increased Chinese (but not Canadian) participants’ judgments of effort and
motivation in the face of hardship (Study 1). Bitter taste also increased perceptions
of unfairness for Canadian participants (Studies 1-3) as well as Chinese
participants who lived in Canada, provided they were tested in English (Studies 1
and 3) rather than Chinese (Study 3); it did not influence fairness perceptions of
Chinese participants who had never lived in an English speaking country (Study 2).
Bitter food is rejected by most people, presumably because it is associated
with toxins, which makes its avoidance adaptive (Desor, Maller & Andrews 1975;
Glendinning, 1994). Nevertheless, bitter taste plays an important role in Chinese
cuisine (Newman, 2004) and bitter tea is considered the soul of Chinese drink
(Evans, 1992). In Chinese sayings, bitterness is associated metaphorically with
concepts related to adversity. Chi-Ku (“eating bitterness”) means “to endure a
hardship,” “to overcome difficulties,” and “to forge ahead” (Loyalka, 2012).
Chinese children are taught to embrace the experience of Chi-Ku (eat their
bitterness) because it is considered a necessary step on the road to success, as
illustrated by sayings such as “only via eating bitterness can you surpass your
peers.” Compatible with this link between bitter taste and hardship, Chen and
Chang (2012) observed that a bitter taste experience increased the accessibility and
retention of survival related words for Chinese participants.
This metaphorical meaning of bitter taste is uncommon in the English
language and largely unfamiliar to Americans and Canadians. Instead, English
speakers use the term bitter to describe a negative experience that results from
unfair treatment or injustice (Oxford Dictionary, n.d). This link is exemplified by a
famous quote from Emmeline Pankhurst, an early British feminist leader, who
observed, “I have not personally suffered from the deprivations, the bitterness and
sorrow which bring so many men and women to a realization of social injustice.” 
These observations suggest an association between bitter taste and endurance of
hardship in Chinese (but not in Canadian) culture and between bitter taste and
injustice in Canadian (but not in Chinese) culture.
The present studies test whether these cultural differences in metaphors have
downstream consequences: Does tasting something bitter influence Chinese (but
not Canadian) participants’ judgments of endurance and Canadian (but not Chinese)
participants’ judgments of injustice? We further test whether such cultural
differences fade during extended exposure to the other culture and whether such
acculturation effects depend on the language in which participants are tested.",0
"Background
A number of preclinical studies in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease have demonstrated that coenzyme Q10 can protect the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Some clinical trials have looked at the neuroprotective effects of coenzyme Q10 in patients with early and midstage Parkinson's disease.

Objectives
To assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of treatment with coenzyme Q10 compared to placebo in patients with early and midstage Parkinson's disease.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Movment Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2011), and EMBASE (January 1985 to March 2011). We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, congress reports from the most important neurological association and movement disorder societies in Europe and America (March 2011), checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers.

Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared coenzyme Q10 to placebo for patients who suffered early and midstage primary Parkinson's disease. Studies in which the method of randomization or concealment were unknown were included. Cross‐over studies were excluded.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All disagreements were resolved by consensus between authors and were explained. We attempted to contact the authors of studies for further details if any data were missing and to establish the characteristics of unpublished trials through correspondence with the trial coordinator or principal investigator. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.

Main results
Four randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials with a total of 452 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. In overall, there were improvements in activities of daily living (ADL) UPDRS (WMD ‐3.12, 95% CI ‐5.88 to ‐0.36) and Schwab and England (WMD 4.43, 95% CI 0.05 to 8.81) for coenzyme Q10 at 1200 mg/d for 16 months versus placebo.

In safety outcomes, only the risk ratios (RR) of pharyngitis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.89) and diarrhea (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.16) are mild elevated between coenzyme Q10 therapy and placebo and there were no differences in the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.62).

Authors' conclusions
Coenzyme Q10 therapy with 1200 mg/d for 16 months was well tolerated by patients with Parkinson's disease. The improvements in ADL UPDRS and Schwab and England were positive, but it need to be further confirmed by larger sample. For total and other subscores of UPDRS, the effects of coenzyme Q10 seemed to be less clear.",0
" Cervical cancer is known as the possible outcome of genital infection, while the molecular mechanisms of initiation, development, and metastasis of cervical cancer have not yet been fully elucidated. Our study aims to investigate the effects of microRNA‐92a (miR‐92a) on tumor growth and immune function by targeting PTEN 
via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in tumor‐bearing mice. C57BL/6 female mice were used for tumor‐bearing mouse models and their tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected, and normal cervical tissues were obtained from normal mice. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) and soluble interleukin‐2 receptor (sIL‐2R) were detected by ELISA. The cells were divided into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), miR‐92a mimic, miR‐92a inhibitor, siRNA‐PTEN, and miR‐92a inhibitor + siRNA‐PTEN groups. Dual‐luciferase reporter assay was adopted to determine the relationship between PTEN and miR‐92a. Expressions of miR‐92a, PTEN, TNF‐α, sIL‐2R, ERK1, and ERK2 were tested by RT‐qPCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was detected by cell count kit‐8 (
CCK‐8); cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Compared with the normal cervical tissues and adjacent normal tissues, the cervical cancer tissues exhibited increased expressions of miR‐92a, p‐ERK1/2, and serum levels of TNF‐α and sIL‐2R while decreased PTEN expression. PTEN was confirmed to be the target gene of miR‐92a. As compared with the blank and NC groups, expressions of miR‐92a, ERK1 and ERK2 increased, and expressions of PTEN decreased in the miR‐92a mimic group. The miR‐92a mimic group exhibited increased expression levels of TNF‐α and sIL‐2R, cell proliferation, and cell number in S phase but decreased cell apoptosis, and cell number in G0/G1 phase, while the miR‐92a inhibitor group followed opposite trends. miR‐92a promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune function by inhibiting PTEN 
via activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in mice bearing U14 cervical cancer.

"Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) at its early stages remains a challenge for modern clinicians. In
this study, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to address this problem. In particular, we
develop a CNN-based network model highly capable of discriminating PD patients based on Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy controls. A total of 2723 SPECT images are analyzed
in this study, of which 1364 images from the healthy control group, and the other 1359 images are in the PD
group. Image normalization process is carried out to enhance the regions of interests (ROIs) necessary for our
network to learn distinguishing features from them. A 10-fold cross-validation is implemented to evaluate the
performance of the network model. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance with an accuracy of
99.34 %, sensitivity of 99.04 % and specificity of 99.63 %, outperforming all previously published results. Given
the high performance and easy-to-use features of our network, it can be deduced that our approach has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of PD and its management.",0
"Background In randomized studies, the strategy of pulmonary vein antral isolation (PVI) plus linear ablation has failed
to increase success rates for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF) ablation when compared with PVI alone. Peri-mitral reentry
related atrial tachycardia due to incomplete linear block is an important cause of clinical failures of a first ablation procedure.
Ethanol infusion (EI) into the vein of Marshall (EI-VOM) has been demonstrated to facilitate a durable mitral isthmus linear
lesion.
Objective This trial is designed to compare arrhythmia-free survival between PVI and an ablation strategy termed
upgraded ‘2C3L’ for the ablation of PeAF.
Study Design The PROMPT-AF study (clinicaltrials.gov 04497376) is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial using a 1:1 parallel-control approach. Patients (n = 498) undergoing their first catheter ablation of PeAF will be
randomized to either the upgraded ‘2C3L’ arm or PVI arm in a 1:1 fashion. The upgraded ‘2C3L’ technique is a fixed ablation approach consisting of EI-VOM, bilateral circumferential PVI, and 3 linear ablation lesion sets across the mitral isthmus,
left atrial roof, and cavotricuspid isthmus. The follow-up duration is 12 months. The primary end point is freedom from atrial
arrhythmias of >30 seconds, without antiarrhythmic drugs, in 12 months after the index ablation procedure (excluding a
blanking period of 3 months).
Conclusions The PROMPT-AF study will evaluate the efficacy of the fixed ‘2C3L’ approach in conjunction with EI-VOM,
compared with PVI alone, in patients with PeAF undergoing de novo ablation. (Am Heart J 2023;260:34–43.)",0
"Multifarious biological functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been
reported in various cancers including bladder cancer (BCa). This study aims to
determine the biological role of a certain lncRNA in BCa. Consistent with the data of
The Cancer Genome Atlas database, it was validated that lncRNA HLA complex group
22 (HCG22) was weakly expressed in BCa samples and lowly expressed HCG22 was
closely correlated with low overall survival of the BCa patient. To verify the role of
HCG22 in BCa progression, functional experiments were carried out in two
representative BCa cells (J82 and T24) and the negative effects of HCG22 expression
on the cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition were
identified. Mechanistically, polypyrimidine tract‐binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which was
highly expressed in BCa tissues and cell lines, was negatively regulated by HCG22
and the PTBP1‐mediated Warburg effect was also obstructed by HCG22.
Furthermore, HCG22 modulated the expression of PTBP1 through destabilizing
human antigen R (HuR). And functional rescue assays confirmed that HCG22
functioned in bladder cancer through downregulating PTBP1. In conclusion, the
present study revealed that HCG22 inhibited BCa progression via the HuR/PTBP1
axis, opening new prospects for potent therapeutic regimens for BCa patients.",0
"The present study examined how the format in which treatment information is presented impacts individuals’ preferences for posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) treatments. Adults who screened positive for PTSD (N = 301) were randomized into groups to learn about
five first-line treatments; participants either read sequential text descriptions or reviewed a comparison chart that presented side-by-side
information. Participants rated treatment acceptability, rank ordered treatments from most to least preferred, and indicated their confidence
in this ranking. Compared with participants in the text group, those in the chart group assigned more favorable acceptability ratings
to prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and more moderate ratings to medications. Cognitive processing therapy was the most common
first-choice treatment (43.6%). Forced-choice treatment rankings were similar across conditions, although participants in the chart group
ranked PE more favorably than those in the text group, odds ratio (OR) = 0.54, 95% CI [0.35, 0.82], p = .004. Confidence in treatment
rankings did not differ across conditions. The results suggest that perceptions of treatment acceptability can be influenced by the format in
which treatment information is presented. In settings where the goal is to increase treatment acceptability, side-by-side formats may offer
an advantage over sequential descriptions of each treatment.

"Firearm injuries are one of the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality among children. Limited information exists about the impact of nonfatal firearm
injuries on utilization and expenditures. Our objective was to compare health care
encounters and expenditures 1 year before and 1 year following a nonfatal firearm

This was a retrospective cohort study of children 0 to 18 years with ICD-9/ICD-10

2  PULCINI et a. |   
BACKGROUND
Firearm injuries are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children.1-4
 In 2018, there were an estimated 11,141
emergency department (ED) visits for nonfatal firearm injuries
in the United States among children aged 0 to 18 years of age.5
Despite the high incidence of such injuries, little is known about the
overall health care utilization and costs associated with nonfatal injuries among children. Furthermore, even less is known in regard to
health and expenditure outcomes after an initial nonfatal childhood
firearm injury.
Previous research has attempted to characterize the health outcomes and health care expenditures of firearm injuries among young
adults opposed to children and adolescents. These studies are limited
by a host of factors that limit their generalizability (e.g., performed at
a single site) and only include estimates of utilization and/or cost at
the time of injury without a more longitudinal approach.6-9
 A recent
study by Ranney et al.10 describes significant utilization increases and
expenditures among all age groups after a firearm injury compared
to before. This study, however, had a limited number of children (133
under the age of 15 and 333 aged 15–19 years), was exclusively focused on privately insured patients, and was limited to 6 months after
the injury.
Based on the limitations of the existing literature, we sought to
compare the health care utilization and expenditures for a large sample of children suffering from a nonfatal firearm injury 1 year before
and 1 year after the injury. We hypothesized that both utilization
and expenditures will increase the year after a firearm injury for all
groups of children, most notably among the children who were previously healthy. Our overall goal was to evaluate the burden of nonfatal childhood firearm injuries on the health care system.
METHODS
Data source and study design
We analyzed data from the Medicaid MarketScan (IBM Watson
Health, Armonk, NY) 2010 to 2016 claims database.11 This database
identifies children enrolled in the Medicaid or the Children's Health
Insurance Program fee-for-service and managed care plans from
10 to 12 states within all geographic regions of the United States.
It includes data on health care expenditures by claim and enrollee
demographic and clinical characteristics that have been aggregated
and prepared for analysis across multiple states.
Study population and diagnostic categories
We included all claims for children 0 to 18 years of age with an
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) claim associated with firearm
injuries from 2010 to 2016 according to Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (Appendix S1, available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper, which is available at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.14252/full). 12
We included those who were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 11
of 12 months before and after the firearm injury to allow for common
coverage gaps that may have occurred among children. We only included individuals whose initial firearm-related claim was from an ED
or inpatient encounter in an attempt to focus the analysis from the
time of the primary event. We identified index injuries by ensuring that
each child did not have a firearm injury diagnosis in the year prior. We
excluded any child who died during this time frame. A CONSORT diagram detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria is included as Figure 1.
We evaluated the cohort in aggregate and by three subgroups
derived by nearest-neighbor clustering preinjury health care expenditures. This analytic technique groups patients based on their
FIGURE 1 Consort diagram

"Objectives To identify the chemicals released in I Quit Ordinary Smoking (IQOS) heat-not-burn tobacco aerosol and to assess their potential human health toxicity.

Methods The heating temperature window of the IQOS heat-not-burn device was determined using a thermographic camera over a period of 100 s. Qualitative studies were performed using a novel real-time gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer set-up. Aerosols from six tobacco-flavoured IQOS HeatSticks (Amber, Blue, Bronze, Sienna, Turquoise and Yellow) were collected in a 1 mL loop via a manual syringe attached to the sample-out port of the valve. The gas transport line was heated to 200°C in order to prevent the condensation of volatile species. Compound identification was performed using the NIST11 mass spectrometry database library (US National Institute of Standards and Technology), where only chemicals with a match of 70% and above were listed as identifiable.

Results The temperature profile of the IQOS device revealed a non-combustive process employed in generating the tobacco aerosol. Real-time qualitative analysis revealed 62 compounds encompassing a broad spectrum of chemicals such as carbonyls, furans and phthalates, which are highly toxic.

Discussion Our findings complement the qualitative studies previously performed by Philip Morris International and others via indirect sampling methods. By analysing the aerosols in real time, we have identified a total of 62 compounds, from which only 10 were in common with previous studies. Several identified species such as diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, hydroxymethylfurfural and diethylhexyl phthalate are classified as highly toxic, with the latter considered carcinogenic.

": We performed a retrospective analysis spanning ten years of pediatric practice focused
on patients with variable vaccination born into a practice, presenting a unique opportunity to
study the effects of variable vaccination on outcomes. The average total incidence of billed office
visits per outcome related to the outcomes were compared across groups (Relative Incidence of
Office Visit (RIOV)). RIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full cohort,
cumulative incidence analyses, matched for days of care, and matched for family history analyses were
conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were
robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family history, gender block, age block, and false discovery
risk. Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care (e.g., anemia
(6.334), asthma (3.496), allergic rhinitis (6.479), and sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test).
Developmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence
in the practice, potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and
family history of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study
had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to 5.3% of the (partially and fully)
vaccinated. The implications of these results for the net public health effects of whole-population
vaccination and with respect for informed consent on human health are compelling. Our results give
agency to calls for research conducted by individuals who are independent of any funding sources
related to the vaccine industry. While the low rates of developmental disorders prevented sufficiently
powered hypothesis testing, it is notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum disorder (0.361%) in
the cohort is one-fifth that of the US national rate (1.851%). The practice-wide rate of ADHD was
roughly half of the national rate. The data indicate that unvaccinated children in the practice are not
unhealthier than the vaccinated and indeed the overall results may indicate that the unvaccinated
pediatric patients in this practice are healthier overall than the vaccinated.",0
"Over the past two decades, the study of moral reasoning has been heavily influenced by Joshua Greene’s dualprocess model of moral judgment, according to which deontological judgments are typically supported by
intuitive, automatic processes while utilitarian judgments are typically supported by reflective, conscious pro
cesses. However, most of the evidence gathered in support of this model comes from the study of people’s
judgments about sacrificial dilemmas, such as Trolley Problems. To which extent does this model generalize to
other debates in which deontological and utilitarian judgments conflict, such as the existence of harmless moral
violations, the difference between actions and omissions, the extent of our duties of assistance, and the appro
priate justification for punishment? To find out, we conducted a series of five studies on the role of reflection in
these kinds of moral conundrums. In Study 1, participants were asked to answer under cognitive load. In Study 2,
participants had to answer under a strict time constraint. In Studies 3 to 5, we sought to promote reflection
through exposure to counter-intuitive reasoning problems or direct instruction. Overall, our results offer strong
support to the extension of Greene’s dual-process model to moral debates on the existence of harmless violations
and partial support to its extension to moral debates on the extent of our duties of assistance.",0

Abstract
In Brief
OBJECTIVE: 
To evaluate characteristics associated with treatment failure 1 year after midurethral sling in women with mixed urinary incontinence.

METHODS: 
Four-hundred three women who participated in a randomized trial that compared midurethral sling and behavioral and pelvic floor muscle therapy (combined group) compared with midurethral sling alone for mixed incontinence with 1-year follow-up data were eligible for this planned secondary analysis. Overall treatment failure was defined as meeting criteria for subjective or objective failure or both. Subjective failure was defined as not meeting the minimal clinical important difference for improvement on the UDI (Urogenital Distress Inventory) total score (26.1 points). Objective failure was defined as not achieving 70% improvement on mean incontinence episodes of any type per day or having undergone any additional treatment for persistent urinary symptoms at 12 months postoperative. Logistic regression models for treatment failure were constructed. Independent variables included site and treatment group, and clinical and demographic variables based on bivariate comparisons (P<.2). Treatment group interaction effects were evaluated.

RESULTS: 
One hundred twelve of 379 (29.6%) women had overall treatment failure, with 56 of 379 (14.7%) undergoing additional treatment but only two needing intervention for stress incontinence. Previous overactive bladder (OAB) medication (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.19, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.17–3.31); detrusor overactivity on cystometrogram (OR 2.25, aOR 2.82, 95% CI 1.60–4.97); and higher volume at first urge (OR 1.03, aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07) were associated with overall failure. Worse UDI-urgency scores were associated with failure, with an added interaction effect in the midurethral sling–alone group.

CONCLUSIONS: 
Certain clinical and urodynamic variables are associated with treatment failure after midurethral sling in women with mixed urinary incontinence. Women with more severe urgency symptoms at baseline may benefit from perioperative behavioral and pelvic floor muscle therapy combined with midurethral sling. Overall, the need for additional urinary treatment was low and primarily for OAB.",0
"Arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 is associated with human breast cancer metastasis.
Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here we identified the pivotal roles of
PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7
exerted its functions through binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of
SHANK2 at R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK
domain blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with SHANK2 on
endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal FAK/cortactin signals in
vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397
phosphorylation and cortactin Y421 phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast
cancer tissues. These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key
player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of SHANK2 R240
methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.",0
"Psychotic disorders are some of the most severe psychiatric conditions. Patients have difficulties in identifying
facial expressions and appear to be highly sensitive to the presence of emotional distractors. Yet, no study has
investigated whether perceptual load modulates the interference of emotional distractors. Our goal was to test
whether psychotic patients were more sensitive to irrelevant emotional stimulus, even when the task demands a
high amount of attentional resources. Twenty-two participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
and twenty-two healthy controls, performed a target letter discrimination task with emotional task-irrelevant
stimulus (angry, happy and neutral facial expressions). Target-letters were presented among distrator-letters,
which could be similar (low perceptual load) or different (high load); participants should discriminate the
target-letter and ignore the facial expression. Results showed that patients were more prone to distraction by
task-irrelevant stimulus, especially under high load, suggesting difficulties in attention control. Moreover, in
psychotic patients, happy faces caused higher interference with the task, whereas neutral and angry faces
resulted in less interference. These findings could provide innovative approaches regarding attentional deficits
on social contexts in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The incidence of
pulmonary adenocarcinoma locates first in all
the malignant tumors in the world. At present,
there are many diagnostic methods for pulmonary adenocarcinoma, but there are a few methods that are mature or have ideal application
prospects. We aim to explore the role of VRK2
in the occurrence and development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma and its possible regulatory mechanism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Western blot and
qRT-PCR were performed to assess the expression of VRK2. Flow cytometry, Western blot, and
Caspase-3 colorimetric assay Kit were used to
evaluate the apoptosis level. The proliferation,
migration, and invasion ability were measured
via cell cycle assay, wound healing, and transwell invasion assay. Luciferase assay verified
the relationship between VRK2 and miR-145-5p.
The effect of FGD5-AS1 on tumorigenesis of glioma was detected by the xenograft nude mice
model.
RESULTS: VRK2 was significantly increased
in tumor tissues and cell lines. Loss of VRK2
promoted apoptosis level and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in A549 cells
via regulating the ERK1/2/AKT signal pathway.
Luciferase assay reported that VRK2 could bind
with miR-145-5p. The level of miR-145-5p was
negatively correlated with the expression of
VRK2 and involved in VRK2 regulating tumor
progression. The tumor growth assay showed
that the silencing of VRK2 inhibited tumorigenesis with the inactivating ERK1/2/AKT pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of VRK2 inhibited the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma via regulating the ERK1/2/AKT signal
pathway by targeting miR-145-5p, which providing some novel experimental basis for clinical
treatment of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.",0

"""PurposeDegenerative retinal diseases are characterized by inflammation and microglial activation. The nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), is an anti-inflammatory in models of diabetes and glaucoma. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that retinal inflammation and microglia activation are initiated and sustained by oxidative stress and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and that CBD reduces inflammation by blocking these processes.
          MethodsMicroglial cells were isolated from retinas of newborn rats. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were estimated with ELISA. Nitric oxide (NO) was determined with a NO analyzer. Superoxide anion levels were determined by the chemiluminescence of luminol derivative. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was estimated by measuring the cellular oxidation products of 2’, 7’-dichlorofluorescin diacetate.
          ResultsIn retinal microglial cells, treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced immediate NADPH oxidase-generated ROS. This was followed by p38 MAPK activation and resulted in a time-dependent increase in TNF-α production. At a later phase, LPS induced NO, ROS, and p38 MAPK activation that peaked at 2-6 h and was accompanied by morphological change of microglia. Treatment with 1 μM CBD inhibited ROS formation and p38 MAPK activation, NO and TNF-α formation, and maintained cell morphology. In addition, LPS-treated rat retinas showed an accumulation of macrophages and activated microglia, significant levels of ROS and nitrotyrosine, activation of p38 MAPK, and neuronal apoptosis. These effects were blocked by treatment with 5 mg/kg CBD.
          ConclusionsRetinal inflammation and degeneration in uveitis are caused by oxidative stress. CBD exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects by a mechanism that involves blocking oxidative stress and activation of p38 MAPK and microglia.""",0
"""BackgroundThe objective was to develop a novel algorithm that can predict, based on field survey data, the minimum vaccination coverage required to reduce the mean number of infections per infectious individual to less than one (the Outbreak Response Immunization Threshold or ORIT) from up to six days in the advance.
          Methodology/Principal FindingsFirst, the relationship between the rate of immunization and the ORIT was analyzed to establish a link. This relationship served as the basis for the development of a recursive algorithm that predicts the ORIT using survey data from two consecutive days. The algorithm was tested using data from two actual measles outbreaks. The prediction day difference (PDD) was defined as the number of days between the second day of data input and the day of the prediction. The effects of different PDDs on the prediction error were analyzed, and it was found that a PDD of 5 minimized the error in the prediction. In addition, I developed a model demonstrating the relationship between changes in the vaccination coverage and changes in the individual reproduction number.
          Conclusions/SignificanceThe predictive algorithm for the ORIT generates a viable prediction of the minimum number of vaccines required to stop an outbreak in real time. With this knowledge, the outbreak control agency may plan to expend the lowest amount of funds required stop an outbreak, allowing the diversion of the funds saved to other areas of medical need.""",0

"USP4 is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family of deubiquitinating enzymes that has a role in spliceosome regulation. Here, we show that the crystal structure of the minimal catalytic domain of USP4 has the conserved USP-like fold with its typical ubiquitin-binding site. A ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain inserted into the catalytic domain has autoregulatory function. This Ubl domain can bind to the catalytic domain and compete with the ubiquitin substrate, partially inhibiting USP4 activity against different substrates. Interestingly, other USPs, such as USP39, could relieve this inhibition.",0
"""BackgroundWe previously found a significant benefit of vitamin C supplementation in asthmatic children.
          PurposeTo test whether the effect of vitamin C on asthma is heterogeneous over the participant population.
          MethodsEgyptian asthmatic children between 7 and 10 years of age (n = 60) were included in the cross-over trial. They were administered 0.2 grams per day of vitamin C and placebo for separate 6-week periods. The variation in the vitamin C effect on two clinically relevant outcomes was analyzed: the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT), which measures the severity of asthma symptoms (the scale ranges from 0 to 27 points, < 20 points indicating unsatisfactory asthma control), and FEV1
          ResultsThe effect of vitamin C on the C-ACT was significantly modified by age and baseline C-ACT levels. In the children aged 7.0-8.2 years with a baseline C-ACT of 18 to 19 points, vitamin C increased the C-ACT score by 4.2 points (95% CI: 3.3-5.3); whereas in the children aged 8.3-10 years who had a baseline C-ACT of 14 to 15 points, vitamin C increased the C-ACT score by only 1.3 points (95% CI: 0.1-2.5).

"ObjectiveMany traumatised refugees suffer from both persistent pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To date, no specific guidelines exist for treatment of this group of patients. This paper presents data on a pilot treatment study conducted with 15 traumatised refugees with persistent pain and PTSD.
          MethodsParticipants received 10 sessions of pain-focused treatment with biofeedback (BF) followed by 10 sessions of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET). Structured interviews and standardised questionnaires were used to assess symptoms of pain intensity, pain disability, PTSD and quality of life directly before and after treatment and at 3 months follow-up.
          ResultsFollowing the combined intervention, participants showed a significant reduction in both pain and PTSD symptoms, as well as improved quality of life. Additionally, biofeedback increased motivation for subsequent trauma-focused therapy, which in turn was related to larger PTSD treatment gains.

"The incidence and severity of allergic asthma have increased over the last century, particularly in the United States and other developed countries. This time frame was characterized by marked environmental changes, including enhanced hygiene, decreased pathogen exposure, increased exposure to inhaled pollutants, and changes in diet. Although iron is well-known to participate in critical biologic processes such as oxygen transport, energy generation, and host defense, iron deficiency remains common in the United States and world-wide. The purpose of these studies was to determine how dietary iron supplementation affected the severity of allergic inflammation in the lungs, using a classic model of IgE-mediated allergy in mice. Results showed that mice fed an iron-supplemented diet had markedly decreased allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity, eosinophil infiltration, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, compared with control mice on an unsupplemented diet that generated mild iron deficiency but not anemia.

"BackgroundIn patients with schizophrenia, altered brain activation and motor activity levels are central features, reflecting cognitive impairments and negative symptoms, respectively. Newer studies using nonlinear methods have addressed the severe disturbances in neurocognitive functioning that is regarded as one of the core features of schizophrenia. Our aim was to compare brain activation and motor activity in a patient during pharmacological treatment that was switched from a first- to a second-generation antipsychotic drug. We hypothesised that this change of medication would increase level of responding in both measures.
          Case presentationWe present the case of a 53-year-old male with onset of severe mental illness in adolescence, ICD-10 diagnosed as schizophrenia of paranoid type, chronic form. We compared brain activation and motor activity in this patient during pharmacological treatment with a first-generation (perphenazin), and later switched to a second-generation (risperidone) antipsychotic drug. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activation and wrist worn actigraphy to measure motor activity.
          ConclusionOur study showed that brain activation decreased in areas critical for cognitive functioning in this patient, when changing from a first to a second generation antipsychotic drug. However the mean motor activity level was unchanged, although risperidone reduced variability, particularly short-term variability from minute to minute. Compared to the results from previous studies, the present findings indicate that changing to a second-generation antipsychotic alters variability measures towards that seen in a control group, but with reduced brain activation, which was an unexpected finding.",0
"Lymphocyte apoptosis is one reason for immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, although the triggers are unknown. We hypothesized that molecules in plasma, which are up-regulated during sepsis, may be responsible for this. In this study, peripheral lymphocyte apoptosis caused by extracellular histones was confirmed both in mouse and human primary lymphocytes, in which histones induced lymphocyte apoptosis dose-dependently and time-dependently. To identify which intracellular signal pathways were activated, phosphorylation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were evaluated during this process, and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was used to confirm the role of p38 in lymphocyte apoptosis induced by histones. To investigate the mitochondrial injury during these processes, we analyzed Bcl2 degradation and Rhodamine 123 to assess mitochondrial-membrane stability, via cyclosporin A as an inhibitor for mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Then, caspase 3 activation was also checked by western-blotting. We found that p38 phosphorylation, mitochondrial injury and caspase 3 activation occurred dose-dependently in histones-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis. We also observed that p38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased lymphocyte apoptotic ratio by 49% (P<0.05), and inhibition of MPT protected lymphocytes from apoptosis. Furthermore, to investigate whether histones are responsible for lymphocyte apoptosis, various concentrations of histone H4 neutralization antibodies were co-cultured with human primary lymphocytes and plasma from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice or sham mice. The results showed that H4 neutralization antibody dose-dependently blocked lymphocyte apoptosis caused by septic plasma in vitro",0
"ObjectiveAccumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory cell infiltration is crucial pathogenesis during the initiation and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given Rho-kinase (ROCK), an important kinase control the actin cytoskeleton, regulates the inflammatory cell infiltration, thus, we investigate the possibility and mechanism of preventing experimental AAA progression via targeting ROCK in mice porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model.
          Methods and ResultsAAA was created in 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by transient intraluminal porcine pancreatic elastase infusion into the infrarenal aorta. The mRNA level of RhoA, RhoC, ROCK1 and ROCK2 were elevated in aneurismal aorta. Next, PPE infusion mice were orally administrated with vehicle or ROCK inhibitor (Fasudil at dose of 200 mg/kg/day) during the period of day 1 prior to PPE infusion to day 14 after PPE infusion. PPE infusion mice treated with Fasudil produced significantly smaller aneurysms as compare to PPE infusion mice treated with vehicle. AAAs developed in all vehicle-treated groups within 14 days, whereas AAAs developed in six mice (66%, 6/9) treated with Fasudil within 14 days. Furthermore, our semi-quantitative histological analysis revealed that blood vessels and macrophages were significantly reduced in Fasudil treated mice during the AAA progression. Finally, when mice with existing AAAs were treated with Fasudil, the enlargement was nearly completely suppressed.
          ConclusionFasudil inhibits experimental AAA progression and stabilize existing aneurysms, through mechanisms likely related to impaired mural macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis. These findings suggest that ROCK inhibitor may hold substantial translational value for AAA diseases.",0
"Author SummaryThe torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a diverse group of viruses that ubiquitously infect humans and establish persistent infections. Despite their prevalence, TTVs lack concrete disease associations and remain among the most poorly characterized human viruses. Here we use computational and synthetic approaches to identify new noncoding miRNA genes in the TTVs. We demonstrate that TTVs utilize the host miRNA biogenesis machinery to produce biologically active miRNAs. To gain a functional understanding of the new TTV genes, we focus on a particular viral isolate and identify N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) as a direct target. NMI is a known modulator of interferon and cytokine signaling. Similar to other viruses encoding miRNAs, the TTVs likely utilize miRNAs to promote persistence and immune evasion. Our study provides new insights into novel TTV gene products and the interactions of this virus with its host.",0

"A difficult problem in quantum network communications is how to efficiently transmit quantum information over large-scale networks with common channels. We propose a solution by developing a quantum encoding approach. Different quantum states are encoded into a coherent superposition state using quantum linear optics. The transmission congestion in the common channel may be avoided by transmitting the superposition state. For further decoding and continued transmission, special phase transformations are applied to incoming quantum states using phase shifters such that decoders can distinguish outgoing quantum states. These phase shifters may be precisely controlled using classical chaos synchronization via additional classical channels. Based on this design and the reduction of multiple-source network under the assumption of restricted maximum-flow, the optimal scheme is proposed for specially quantized multiple-source network. In comparison with previous schemes, our scheme can greatly increase the transmission efficiency.",0
"The human genome is pervasively transcribed, yet only a small fraction is coding. Here we address whether this noncoding transcription arises at promoters, and detail the interactions of initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Using ChIP-exo, we identify ~160,000 transcription initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer genomes. Only ~5% associate with mRNA genes. The remaining associate with non-polyadenylated noncoding transcription. Regardless, Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP/TFIIB remain at the promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core promoter elements: BREud",0
"PurposeStudies on the association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and breast cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We quantitatively assessed this association by conducting a meta-analysis based on the evidence from observational studies.
          MethodsWe searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published up to and including December 31, 2013. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for cancer risk.
          ResultsA total of 17 studies (9 cohort studies, 8 case-control studies) were selected for further study. These studies included 149,607 female subjects, of which 53,812 were CCBs users, who were followed for 2–16 years. The risks of breast cancer among patients receiving CCBs were significantly different for the pooled RRs (95% confidence interval) of cohort studies 1.08 (0.95, 1.20) and case-control studies 0.98 (0.86, 1.09). Differences were also noted for cancer risk, for CCBs use of <5 years 0.96 (0.78, 1.15), and for >5 years 1.01 (0.74, 1.28), as well as for ever used 1.08 (0.95, 1.20), and for current use 1.13 (0.83, 1.42). The RR for studies longer than 10 years was 1.71 (1.01, 2.42), and for studies evaluating nifedipine was 1.10 (0.87, 1.33) and diltiazem was 0.75 (0.40, 1.10).
          ConclusionsThe long-term use of CCBs appears to have a significant relationship with breast cancer. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to optimize the doses and types of these drugs needed to minimize their carcinogenic potential.",0
"PurposeThe axillary arch is an anomalous muscle that is not infrequently encountered during axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of breast cancer patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate how often the axillary arch is found during SLNB and whether it affects the intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate.
          MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the correlation between the presence of the axillary arch and the SLN sampling failure rate during SLNB in 1,069 patients who underwent axillary SLNB for invasive breast cancer.
          ResultsOf 1,069 patients who underwent SLNB, 79 patients (7.4%) had the axillary arch present. The SLNB failure rate was high when the patient's body mass index was ≥25 (ppppp
          ConclusionThe axillary arch was found to be a significant factor affecting intraoperative SLN failure rate. It is necessary to keep in mind that carefully checking the high axillar region during SLNB in breast cancer patients with the axillary arch is important for reducing SLN sampling failure.",0
"ObjectivesAlthough a large gauge needle can procure more tissue at endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), its advantage over smaller needles is unclear. This study compared flexible 19G and 25G needles for EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic masses.

          ObjectiveTo systematically review the evidence of effectiveness MBSR and MBCT in different patient categories.
          MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of systematic reviews of RCTs, using the standardized MBSR or MBCT programs. We used PRISMA guidelines to assess the quality of the included reviews and performed a random effects meta-analysis with main outcome measure Cohen’s d. All types of participants were considered.
          ResultsThe search produced 187 reviews: 23 were included, covering 115 unique RCTs and 8,683 unique individuals with various conditions. Compared to wait list control and compared to treatment as usual, MBSR and MBCT significantly improved depressive symptoms (d=0.37; 95%CI 0.28 to 0.45, based on 5 reviews, N=2814), anxiety (d=0.49; 95%CI 0.37 to 0.61, based on 4 reviews, N=2525), stress (d=0.51; 95%CI 0.36 to 0.67, based on 2 reviews, N=1570), quality of life (d=0.39; 95%CI 0.08 to 0.70, based on 2 reviews, N=511) and physical functioning (d=0.27; 95%CI 0.12 to 0.42, based on 3 reviews, N=1015).

"IntroductionA wide variety of atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone and clozapine) are widely used in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are commonly seen in dementia, but results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and safety of these agents are conflicting. We aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotic drugs on neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia patients.
          MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for reports published before August 2014 were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials of atypical antipsychotic drugs therapy in patients with psychotic symptoms of dementia. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted information.
          ResultsOverall, 23 relevant RCTs with 5,819 participants were identified. This meta-analysis demonstrated a significant efficacy of atypical antipsychotics on psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions compared to placebo. In the meta-analysis, the weighted mean differences (WMDs) in change scores for psychiatric symptoms were in favor of aripiprazole (−4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) – 7.04 to −1.77) and risperidone (−1.48, 95% CI −2.35 to −0.61) compared to placebo. In cognitive effects, WMDs in change scores for the Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C) were in favor of aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine which ranged from a −0.30 points mean difference (95% CI:-0.59 to −0.01) in the aripiprazole trials to −0.43 (95% CI:-0.62 to −0.25) in the risperidone group. Patients receiving atypical antipsychotics showed no difference in risk for injuries or falls (PP
          ConclusionAripiprazole and risperidone are able to improve psychiatric symptoms and slow decline in cognition function at average 12 weeks in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. However, high adverse events may offset the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in dementia.

"Summary
          BackgroundDespite the importance of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in China, no nationally representative studies have characterised the clinical profiles, management, and outcomes of this cardiac event during the past decade. We aimed to assess trends in characteristics, treatment, and outcomes for patients with STEMI in China between 2001 and 2011.
          MethodsIn a retrospective analysis of hospital records, we used a two-stage random sampling design to create a nationally representative sample of patients in China admitted to hospital for STEMI in 3 years (2001, 2006, and 2011). In the first stage, we used a simple random-sampling procedure stratified by economic–geographical region to generate a list of participating hospitals. In the second stage we obtained case data for rates of STEMI, treatments, and baseline characteristics from patients attending each sampled hospital with a systematic sampling approach. We weighted our findings to estimate nationally representative rates and assess changes from 2001 to 2011. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01624883.
          FindingsWe sampled 175 hospitals (162 participated in the study) and 18 631 acute myocardial infarction admissions, of which 13 815 were STEMI admissions. 12 264 patients were included in analysis of treatments, procedures, and tests, and 11 986 were included in analysis of in-hospital outcomes. Between 2001 and 2011, estimated national rates of hospital admission for STEMI per 100 000 people increased (from 3·5 in 2001, to 7·9 in 2006, to 15·4 in 2011; ptrendvstrendvstrendvstrendvstrendtrendtrend
          InterpretationDuring the past decade in China, hospital admissions for STEMI have risen; in these patients, comorbidities and the intensity of testing and treatment have increased. Quality of care has improved for some treatments, but important gaps persist and inhospital mortality has not decreased. National efforts are needed to improve the care and outcomes for patients with STEMI in China.",0

In sham mice, an abdominal incision was made, followed by dissection of the bilateral renal pedicle, with no further cross-clamping of arteries. Silymarin + I/R mice were administered 100 mg/kg silymarin daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery, whereas I/R mice were administered (i.g.) 0.9 % saline + 0.1 % (v/v) ethanol daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery. Silymarin + I/R and I/R mice were subjected to renal ischemia to induce acute kidney injury after 45-min clamping of bilateral renal arteries. Serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were measured. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining was undertaken to detect damaged renal tissue. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunofluorescent detection of CD68 expression was undertaken for each group. Levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted by renal tissue were monitored by ELISA. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Expression of cleaved-caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by western blotting.

"AbstractGastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility is a common complication in acute, critically ill, postoperative, and chronic patients that may lead to impaired nutrient delivery, poor clinical, and patient-reported outcomes. Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to treat GI dysmotility were investigated in dozens of clinical studies. However, they often yielded conflicting results, at least in part, because various (nonstandardized) definitions of GI dysmotility were used and methodological quality of studies was poor. While a universally accepted definition of GI dysmotility is yet to be developed, a systematic analysis of data derived from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials may provide robust data on absolute and relative effectiveness of various interventions as the study outcome (GI motility) was assessed in the least biased manner.To systematically review data from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials to determine and compare the effectiveness of interventions that affect GI motility.Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE) were searched. A random effects model was used for meta-analysis. The summary estimates were reported as mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).A total of 38 double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials involving 2371 patients were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review.

"IntroductionAdherence to treatment and dietary restrictions is important for health outcomes of patients with chronic/end-stage kidney disease and hypertension. The relationship of adherence with nutritional and health literacy in children, adolescents, and young adults is not well understood. The current study examined the relationship of health literacy, nutrition knowledge, nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance, and medication adherence in a sample of children and young people with chronic/end-stage kidney disease and hypertension.
          MethodsWe enrolled 74 patients (aged 7–29 y) with a diagnosis of chronic/end-stage kidney disease and hypertension from the University of North Carolina Kidney Center. Participants completed instruments of nutrition literacy (Disease-Specific Nutrition Knowledge Test), health literacy (Newest Vital Sign), nutrition behavior (Nutrition Knowledge–Behavior Concordance Scale), and medication adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale). Linear and binary logistic regressions were used to test the associations.
          ResultsIn univariate comparisons, nutrition knowledge was significantly higher in people with adequate health literacy. Medication adherence was related to nutrition knowledge and nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance. Multivariate regression models demonstrated that knowledge of disease-specific nutrition restrictions did not significantly predict nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance scores. In logistic regression, knowledge of nutrition restrictions did not significantly predict medication adherence. Lastly, health literacy and nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance were significant predictors of medication adherence.
          ConclusionNutrition knowledge and health literacy skills are positively associated. Nutrition knowledge, health literacy, and nutrition knowledge–behavior concordance are positively related to medication adherence. Future research should focus on additional factors that may predict disease-specific nutrition behavior (adherence to dietary restrictions) in children and young people with chronic conditions.",0

"Vaccination is the most powerful way to prevent human beings from contracting infectious diseases including viruses. In the case of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, an unexpectedly novel disease entity, HPV vaccination associated neuro-immunopathetic syndrome (HANS), has been reported and remains to be carefully verified. To elucidate the mechanism of HANS, we applied a strategy similar to the active experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model - one of the most popular animal models used to induce maximum immunological change in the central nervous system. Surprisingly, mice vaccinated with pertussis toxin showed neurological phenotypes that include low responsiveness of the tail reflex and locomotive mobility. Pathological analyses revealed the damage to the hypothalamus and circumventricular regions around the third ventricle, and these regions contained apoptotic vascular endothelial cells. These data suggested that HPV-vaccinated donners that are susceptible to the HPV vaccine might develop HANS under certain environmental factors. These results will give us the new insight into the murine pathological model of HANS and help us to find a way to treat of patients suffering from HANS.",0
"The archaeological sites near Monte Alegre, along Brazil's lower Amazon River, provide new information on the little-known activities and symbolism of South American Paleoindians toward the end of the Ice Age. While paleoindian sites like Monte Verde in Chile, or Guitarrero Cave in Peru, are located near the pacific coast, Monte Alegre lies much further inland, 680 km upriver from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Atlantic Coast. With excavated wood charcoal radiocarbon dated as early as 13,200 calibrated years ago, the hill—as a source of sandstone and quartz lithics—supplied early pioneers with adequate tools needed for colonizing the interior of the continent. Once there, they painted rock art on the landscape, which bears a record of the sun's horizon positions throughout the year. At just 2° south of the equator, Monte Alegre shows no overt seasonal changes beyond fluctuating rainfall amounts, unlike at higher latitudes where temperature, amount of daylight, foliage, and forms of precipitation markedly change. Near the equator, solar and stellar horizon sightings most visibly track the passage of time and seasonal cycles. However, horizons are often hidden behind high forest canopy throughout much of the Amazon Rainforest; but in the Monte Alegre hill ridges looming above the river, paleoindians could hike above the canopy to peer at the horizon, more effectively synchronizing their activities to ecological cycles. This research suggests that Monte Alegre paleoindians delimited the azimuthal range of the sun in a solar year with notational pictographs aligned to horizon sightings at Painel do Pilão, and leaving a painted grid of tally marks that might have served as a rudimentary early calendar. The broad-reaching implication for early Americans is that through the strategic placement of rock art, these ancient artists fostered predictive archaeorecording from which resources could be optimally extracted, ceremonial activities could be consistently scheduled, and gatherings for social and economic exchange could be more efficiently coordinated.",0
"BackgroundTREM-1 acts as an amplifier of inflammation expressed on macrophages. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TREM-1 and macrophage polarization, and association of TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization with insulin resistance (IR) in obese population compared to non-obese population.
          MethodsWe enrolled 38 patients after obtaining IRB approval for this study. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of general macrophage marker (CD68), M1 marker (CD86, CCR7, iNOS, IFNγ, TNF-α and IL-6,), M2 marker (CD206, CD163, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokine axis (MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5) along with TREM-1 and TREM-2 in omentum fat, subcutaneous fat, and liver biopsy tissues of non-obese (N = 5), obese non-diabetics, (N = 16) and obese diabetics (N = 17).
          ResultsThe results of our study showed over-expression of TREM-1, M1 markers and down-regulation of TREM-2 and M2 markers in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsies of obese patients (diabetics and non-diabetics) compared to non-obese patients. Overall, the obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers (TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and down-regulation of M2 markers (CD206, CD163 and IL-4) in liver biopsy compared to obese non-diabetics.
          ConclusionsTREM-1 expression is significantly increased along with the M1 markers in liver biopsy of obese diabetic (17/17) and obese non-diabetic patients (9/16). Our data suggests that TREM-1 overexpression and M1 macrophage polarization are associated with obesity-induced IR.",0

          ResultsSerum levels of miR-143, -145 and -223 were elevated in patients with CKD compared with healthy controls. They were further increased in chronic haemodialysis patients, but were below control levels in renal transplant recipients. In contrast, circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-155 levels, which were also elevated in CKD patients, were lower in the haemodialysis group and even lower in the transplant group. Four of the five miRNA species were correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, and three were correlated with circulating uraemic toxins.

"BackgroundPregnancy is a period of transition, which makes women more vulnerable and in unfavorable conditions may lead to psychopathology in both mother and infant. It is essential to outline factors adversely affecting the resolution of this period. Early interventions and why they matter: Interventions during pregnancy can provide important improvement in the outcome for both maternal and infant mental health.
          AimThe aim of the study is to evaluate the risk factors of antenatal anxiety and depression focusing particularly on maternal representations of the relationship towards the fetus and her own parents during pregnancy and the early postpartum period.
          MethodsThe study is outlined using a quantifiable interview during pregnancy to evaluate the woman’s ability to keep her child in mind, measured by reflective functioning. Reflective functioning provides information regarding the pregnant woman’s relationship quality to her fetus and important people in her life. Primiparae in Stockholm around gestation week 20 are asked about their experience with respect to pregnancy, their relationship to their family, partner, and their unborn child. The women selected to the study are an at risk population, with high levels of stress, childhood adversity, and/or history of mental health. These women are more vulnerable to develop perinatal anxiety and depression.
          ResultsThe pregnancy interview provides valuable insight into the pregnant women’s psychic constitution. The quantifiable measure of their mental state, reflective functioning, serves as measure of quality of the mother’s parenting capacity. The countertransference and transference of the interviewer towards the women during the interview enables a more profound understanding of the underlying dynamics and constructs of repression, aggression, mourning, and narcissistic defenses.
          ConclusionA better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the pregnant women’s intrapsychic reorganization of motherhood and her relation to the unborn child shall facilitate specific early interventions. These interventions shall be targeted to specific risk groups and enable the prevention of adverse child outcomes.",0

          ResultsAccording to our study, the expression levels of claudin-2 and claudin-5 were reduced, while the expression of claudin-8 was increased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues in comparison with non-neoplastic mucosal tissues. Correlations between claudin-2 and -5 expression and metastatic progression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were also found.
          ConclusionIn summary, our research reveals distinct expression profiles of claudin-2, − 5 and − 8 in non-neoplastic mucosal tissues and nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. In addition, the expression of these claudin proteins was highly correlated with metastatic progression and prognosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and had predictive value for the metastasis and survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",0
"NaCT is a Na+-coupled transporter for citrate expressed in hepatocytes and neurons. It is the mammalian ortholog of INDY (I’m Not Dead Yet), a transporter which modifies lifespan in Drosophila. Here we describe a hitherto unknown transport system for citrate in mammalian cells. When liver and mammary epithelial cells were pretreated with the iron supplement ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), uptake of citrate increased >10-fold. Iron chelators abrogated the stimulation of citrate uptake in FAC-treated cells. The iron exporter ferroportin had no role in this process. The stimulation of citrate uptake also occurred when Fe3+ was added during uptake without pretreatment. Similarly, uptake of Fe3+ was enhanced by citrate. The Fe3+-citrate uptake was coupled to Na+. This transport system was detectable in primary hepatocytes and neuronal cell lines. The functional features of this citrate transport system distinguish it from NaCT. Loss-of-function mutations in NaCT cause early-onset epilepsy and encephalopathy; the newly discovered Na+-coupled Fe3+-citrate transport system might offer a novel treatment strategy for these patients to deliver citrate into affected neurons independent of NaCT. It also has implications to iron-overload conditions where circulating free iron increases, which would stimulate cellular uptake of citrate and consequently affect multiple metabolic pathways.",0
"Summary
          BackgroundDiabetes and high body-mass index (BMI) are associated with increased risk of several cancers, and are increasing in prevalence in most countries. We estimated the cancer incidence attributable to diabetes and high BMI as individual risk factors and in combination, by country and sex.
          MethodsWe estimated population attributable fractions for 12 cancers by age and sex for 175 countries in 2012. We defined high BMI as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2
          FindingsWe estimated that 5·6% of all incident cancers in 2012 were attributable to the combined effects of diabetes and high BMI as independent risk factors, corresponding to 792 600 new cases. 187 600 (24·5%) of 766 000 cases of liver cancer and 121 700 (38·4%) of 317 000 cases of endometrial cancer were attributable to these risk factors. In the conservative scenario, about 4·5% (626 900 new cases) of all incident cancers assessed were attributable to diabetes and high BMI combined. Individually, high BMI (544 300 cases) was responsible for twice as many cancer cases as diabetes (280 100 cases). 26·1% of diabetes-related cancers (equating to 77 000 new cases) and 31·9% of high BMI-related cancers (174 040 new cases) were attributable to increases in the prevalence of these risk factors from 1980 to 2002.
          InterpretationA substantial number of cancer cases are attributable to diabetes and high BMI. As the prevalence of these cancer risk factors increases, clinical and public health efforts should focus on identifying optimal preventive and screening measures for whole populations and individual patients.

"BackgroundDecompressive laminectomy (DI) is a standard operation for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patient with severe claudication symptoms for many years. However, patients whose symptom severity does not meet undergoing invasive surgery make therapeutic options into dilemma. Interspinous spacers (ISP) bridge the gap between surgical interventions and CC in management of LSS. In our study, we aim to systematically assess the two FDA-approved interspinous spacers for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: Superion versus X-STOP.
          MethodsElectronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library were searched to retrieve clinical trials concerning the comparison between Superion and X-STOP in treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis before April 2017. The following outcome measures were extracted: (1) Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) patient satisfaction score, (2) axial pain severity, (3) extremity pain severity, (4) back-specific functional impairment, (5) reoperation, and (6) complication. The data analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3.
          ResultsFive randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1118 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analysis indicated that the Superion group is superior to X-STOP in axial pain severity (SMD: 0.03; 95% CI 0.15, 0.45; pI2ppI2ppI2ppI2ppI2ppI2p
          ConclusionBoth the Superion and X-STOP interspinous spacers can relieve symptoms of LSS. In addition, the Superion spacer may represent a promising spacer for patient with LSS. As we know, the effectiveness and safety of ISP is still considered investigational and unfavor clinical results in the medical literature may continue to limit the appeal of IPS to many surgeons in the future. However, because of the advantage of IPS technique, it will win a wide place in the future degenerative lumbar microsurgery.",0
"BackgroundDaysy is a fertility monitor that uses the fertility awareness method by tracking and analyzing the individual menstrual cycle. In addition, Daysy can be connected to the application DaysyView to transfer stored personal data from Daysy to a smartphone or tablet (IOS, Android). This combination is interesting because as it is shown in various studies, the use of apps is increasing patients´ focus on their disease or their health behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate if by the additional use of an App and thereby improved usability of the medical device, it is possible to enhance the typical-use related as well as the method-related pregnancy rates.
          ResultIn the resultant group of 125 women (2076 cycles in total), 2 women indicated that they had been unintentionally pregnant during the use of the device, giving a typical-use related Pearl-Index of 1.3. Counting only the pregnancies which occurred as a result of unprotected intercourse during the infertile (green) phase, we found 1 pregnancy, giving a method-related Pearl-Index of 0.6. Calculating the pregnancy rate resulting from continuous use and unprotected intercourse exclusively on green days, gives a perfect-use Pearl-Index of 0.8.
          ConclusionIt seems that combining a specific biosensor-embedded device (Daysy), which gives the method a very high repeatable accuracy, and a mobile application (DaysyView) which leads to higher user engagement, results in higher overall usability of the method.

"Abstract
          Background:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-articular methylprednisolone for reducing pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
          Methods:We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.11), PubMed (1966-2017.11), Embase (1980-2017.11), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.11), and the Cochrane Library (1900-2017.11) for randomized clinical trials comparing the use of methylprednisolone to treat knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores and WOMAC function scores. Each outcome was combined and calculated using the statistical software STATA 12.0. Fixed/random effect model was adopted based on the heterogeneity tested by I2
          Results:A total of 739 patients were analyzed across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the WOMAC pain scores at 4 weeks (WMD = −1.384, 95% CI: −1.975 to −0.793, P = P = P = P = P = P = 
          Conclusion:Intra-articular methylprednisolone injection was associated with an improved pain relief and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, no severe adverse effects were observed. Due to the limited quality of the evidence currently available, higher quality RCTs were required.",0
"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully implemented in cattle research and breeding. However, moving from the associations to identifying the causal variants and revealing underlying mechanisms have proven complicated. In dairy cattle populations, we face a challenge due to long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) arising from close familial relationships in the studied individuals. Long range LD makes it difficult to distinguish if one or multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) are segregating in a genomic region showing association with a phenotype. We had two objectives in this study: 1) to distinguish between multiple QTL segregating in a genomic region, and 2) use of external information to prioritize candidate genes for a QTL along with the candidate variant.
          ResultsWe observed fixing the lead SNP as a covariate can help to distinguish additional close association signal(s). Thereafter, using the mammalian phenotype database, we successfully found candidate genes, in concordance with previous studies, demonstrating the power of this strategy. Secondly, we used variant annotation information to search for causative variants in our candidate genes. The variant information successfully identified known causal mutations and showed the potential to pinpoint the causative mutation(s) which are located in coding regions.
          ConclusionsOur approach can distinguish multiple QTL segregating on the same chromosome in a single analysis without manual input. Moreover, utilizing information from the mammalian phenotype database and variant effect predictor as post-GWAS analysis could benefit in candidate genes and causative mutations finding in cattle. Our study not only identified additional candidate genes for milk traits, but also can serve as a routine method for GWAS in dairy cattle.

"Media exposure influences mental health symptomology in response to salient aversive events, like terrorist attacks, but little has been done to explore the impact of news coverage that varies more subtly in affective content. Here, we utilized an existing data set in which participants self-reported physical symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and completed a potentiated startle task assessing their physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli at three time points (waves) over a 9-month period. Using a computational linguistics approach, we then calculated an average ratio of words with positive vs. negative affective connotations for only articles from news sources to which each participant self-reported being exposed over the prior 2 weeks at each wave of data collection. As hypothesized, individuals exposed to news coverage with more negative affective tone over the prior 2 weeks reported significantly greater physical and depressive symptoms, and had significantly greater physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli.",0
"BackgroundDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is caused by blood clotting in the deep veins. Thrombosis resolution and recanalization can be accelerated by endothelial progenitor cells. In this report, we investigated the effects of miR-126-loaded EPC-derived exosomes (miR-126-Exo) on EPCs function and venous thrombus resolution.
          MethodsIn vitro promotional effect of miR-126-Exo on the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs was investigated via transwell assay and tube formation assay. In addition, a mouse venous thrombosis model was constructed and treated with miR-126-Exo to clarify the therapeutic effect of miR-126-Exo by histological analysis. Lastly, this study predicted a target gene of miR-126 using target prediction algorithms and confirmed it by luciferase activity assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot.
          ResultsTranswell assay and tube formation assay indicated that miR-126-Exo could enhance the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs. Moreover, in vivo study manifested enhanced thrombus organization and recanalization after miR-126-Exo treatment. Meanwhile, we identified that Protocadherin 7 as a target gene of miR-126.
          ConclusionsTo sum up, our results demonstrated that EPC-derived exosomes loaded with miR-126 significantly promoted thrombus resolution in an animal model of venous thrombosis, indicating exosomes as a promising potential vehicle carrying therapeutic molecules for DVT therapy.",0
"BackgroundHuman schistosomiases are acute and chronic infectious diseases of poverty. Currently, epidemiological data of urinary schistosomiasis (US) in school-age children (SAC) and adults are often reported together making it difficult to ascertain the true status of the disease. Based on this premise, we set out to carry out this review.
          MethodTo achieve this aim, we carried out a computer-aided search of PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, African Journals OnLine (AJOL) and the database of World Health Organization. However, the information obtained from these sources was supplemented with additional literatures from Mendeley, Research Gate, and Google.
          ResultsThe search yielded 183 literatures of which 93 full text research, review and online articles were deemed fit for inclusion. Our key findings showed that: (1) of all World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, Africa is the most endemic zone for US, with Kenya and Senegal recording the highest prevalence and mean intensity respectively; (2) SAC within the range of 5–16 years contribute most significantly to the transmission cycle of US globally; (3) gender is a factor to watch out for, with male often recording the highest prevalence and intensity of infection; (4) contact with open, potentially infested water sources contribute significantly to transmission; (5) parental factors (occupation and education status) predispose SAC to US; (6) economic vis a vis
          ConclusionIn view of the WHO strategic plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2020 and the findings from this review, it is obvious that this goal, in the face of realities, might not be achieved. It is imperative that annual control programmes be scaled up marginally, particularly in the African region of WHO. While US-based researches should be sponsored at the grass-root level to unveil hidden endemic foci, adequate facilities for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) should be put in place in all schools globally.",0
"We report a facile design of an ultra-thin broadband metamaterial absorber (MA) for C-band applications by utilizing a single layer of a metal-dielectric-metal structure of FR-4 substrate. The absorption performances are characterized using a numerical method. The proposed MA exhibits the broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with absorptivity above 90% and the high absorptivity is remained over 80% for a large incident angle up to 40° under both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations over the band. The origin of absorption mechanism is explained by the electric and surface current distributions, which is also supported by the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for C-band applications.",0

          Background:Prenatal exposure to depression has been considered as a risk factor for adverse childhood, while it is accompanied by unknown molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated biological processes between cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers who exposed to major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy mothers.
          Methods:The microarray data GSE114852 were downloaded to analyze the mRNA expression profiles of umbilical cord blood with 31 samples exposed to prenatal MDD and 62 samples with healthy mothers. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene ontology enrichment analyses were conducted to identify associated biochemical pathways and functional categories of the DEGs. The protein–protein interaction network was constructed and the top 10 hub genes in the network were predicted.

"ImportanceAccelerometers and pedometers are accessible technologies that could have a role in encouraging physical activity (PA) in line with current recommendations. However, there is no solid evidence of their association with PA in participants with 1 or more cardiometabolic conditions such as diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
          ObjectivesTo assess the association of accelerometer- and pedometer-based interventions with increased activity and other improved health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic conditions and to examine characteristics of the studies that could influence the association of both interventions in improving PA.
          Data SourcesRecords from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and PsycINFO were searched from inception until August 2018 with no language restriction.
          Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials or cluster randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of wearable technology devices such as pedometers and accelerometers as motivating and monitoring tools for increasing PA were included. After removing duplicates, the searches retrieved 5762 references. Following abstract and title screening of 1439 references and full-text screening of 107 studies, 36 studies met inclusion criteria.
          Data Extraction and SynthesisMean difference in PA was assessed by random-effects meta-analysis. Where the scale was different across studies, the standardized mean difference was used instead. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2
          Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was objectively measured PA in the short to medium term (postintervention to 8 months’ follow-up).
          ResultsThirty-six randomized clinical trials (20 using accelerometers and 16 using pedometers) involving 5208 participants were eligible for review. Meta-analysis involving 32 of these trials (4856 participants) showed medium improvements in PA: accelerometers and pedometers combined vs comparator showed a small significant increase in PA overall (standardized mean difference, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.28-0.51]; I2PP
          Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, complex accelerometer- and pedometer-based interventions led to significant small to medium improvements in PA levels of people with cardiometabolic conditions. However, longer-term trials are needed to assess their performance over time. This study found no evidence that simple self-monitored interventions using either pedometers or accelerometers are associated with improvements in PA.",0

"Objective Propofol is a classical anesthetic and induces consciousness loss, and gamma-aminobutyric-acid-type-A (GABA-A) receptor is its target. Righting reflex is associated with conscious response. The nucleus basalis (NB) acts as a major relay between the reticular activating system and the frontal cortex (FC). Propofol may mediate righting reflex by affecting GABA-A receptor in NB. 
          Methods Fifty male SD rats (250-350 g) were divided into parts I and II. In part I, 20 male SD rats were randomly divided into control group (CG) and NB-lesion group (NG, ibotenic acid-induced NB lesion). In part II, 30 male SD rats were treated with saline (0.9% NaCl, SG group), muscimol (a GABA-A receptor agonist, MG group), and gabazine (a GABA-A receptor antagonist, GG group) in NB, respectively. Two weeks later, the activity of the rats was measured between CG and NG groups. The rats were intravenously injected with propofol (50 mg/kg/h) to test the time of loss of righting reflex (LORR) in all rats. When LORR occurred, the rats received single administration of propofol (12 mg/kg) to measure the time of return of righting reflex (RORR). Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of the frontal cortex (FC) was recorded.

"BackgroundElectronic devices which mimic the functionality of biological synapses are a large step to replicate the human brain for neuromorphic computing and for numerous medical research investigations. One of the representative synaptic behaviors is paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). It has been widely investigated because it is regarded to be related to biological memory. However, plasticity behavior is only part of the human brain memory behavior.
          MethodsHere, we present a phenomenon which is opposite to PPF, i.e., paired-pulse inhibition (PPI), in nano oxide devices for the first time. The research here suggests that rather than being enhanced, the phenomena of memory loss would also be possessed by such electronic devices. The device physics mechanism behind memory loss behavior was investigated. This mechanism is sustained by historical memory and degradation manufactured by device trauma to regulate characteristically stimulated origins of artificial transmission behaviors.
          ResultsUnder the trauma of a memory device, both the signal amplitude and signal time stimulated by a pulse are lower than the first signal stimulated by a previous pulse in the PPF, representing a new scenario in the struggle for memory. In this way, more typical human brain behaviors could be simulated, including the effect of age on latency and error generation, cerebellar infarct, trauma and memory loss pharmacological actions (such as those caused by hyoscines and nitrazepam).
          ConclusionThus, this study developed a new approach for implementing the manner in which the brain works in semiconductor devices for improving medical research.",0

"BackgroundApoptosis and oxidative stress are the main etiology of age related cataract (ARC). This article aims to investigate the role of WRN in lens epithelial cells (LECs).
          MethodsWe estimated the methylation level of WRN in anterior lens capsule tissues of ARC patients. SRA01/04 (LECs) cells were treated with H22
          ResultsWRN was down-regulated and the methylation level of WRN was increased in the anterior lens capsule tissues. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR enhanced proliferation and repressed apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells. 5-Aza-CdR enhanced WRN expression. WRN knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells, which was rescued by 5-Aza-CdR. WRN overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR repressed ATM/p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, chloroquine inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress of SRA01/04 cells by activating ATM/p53 signaling pathway. The influence conferred by chloroquine was abolished by WRN overexpression.
          ConclusionOur study reveals that DNA methylation mediated WRN inhibits apoptosis and oxidative stress of human LECs through ATM/p53 signaling pathway.",0
"There is evidence that human decision-making is affected by current body energy levels and physiological states. There is less clear evidence linking decision-making to long-term changes in energy, as those associated with obesity. We explore the link between energy, obesity and dishonesty by comparing the behaviour of obese and lean subjects when hungry or sated while playing an anonymous die-under-cup task. Participants performed the task either before or after breakfast. We find that short-term switches in energy have only a mild effect on dishonesty, as only lean females lie less when sated. By contrast, obese subjects lie more than lean subjects in both conditions, and they lie more to avoid the lowest payoff than to get the highest payoff. Our findings suggest that the observed patterns are more likely mediated by factors associated with obesity than by short term energy dynamics, and call for a better integration of the psychological, economic and biological drivers of moral behaviour.",0

          ConclusionsCorneal endothelial diseases are associated with TCF4 reduction; TCF4 may be a potential target for hCEC diseases. Gene therapy using TCF4 Human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) have limited regenerative capacity in vivo. Reduced hCEC density results in bullous keratopathy requiring corneal transplantation. This study reveals the role of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in hCEC diseases and suggests that TCF4 may be a molecular target for hCEC regeneration.",0
"Abstract
          BackgroundIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status has emerged as an important prognostic marker in gliomas. Currently, reliable IDH mutation determination requires invasive surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop a highly accurate, MRI-based, voxelwise deep-learning IDH classification network using T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and compare its performance to a multicontrast network.
          MethodsMultiparametric brain MRI data and corresponding genomic information were obtained for 214 subjects (94 IDH-mutated, 120 IDH wild-type) from The Cancer Imaging Archive and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Two separate networks were developed, including a T2w image-only network (T2-net) and a multicontrast (T2w, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and T1 postcontrast) network (TS-net) to perform IDH classification and simultaneous single label tumor segmentation. The networks were trained using 3D Dense-UNets. Three-fold cross-validation was performed to generalize the networks’ performance. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was also performed. Dice scores were computed to determine tumor segmentation accuracy.
          ResultsT2-net demonstrated a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.14% ± 0.04 in predicting IDH mutation status, with a sensitivity of 0.97 ± 0.03, specificity of 0.98 ± 0.01, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 ± 0.01. TS-net achieved a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.12% ± 0.09, with a sensitivity of 0.98 ± 0.02, specificity of 0.97 ± 0.001, and an AUC of 0.99 ± 0.01. The mean whole tumor segmentation Dice scores were 0.85 ± 0.009 for T2-net and 0.89 ± 0.006 for TS-net.
          ConclusionWe demonstrate high IDH classification accuracy using only T2-weighted MR images. This represents an important milestone toward clinical translation.",0

"PurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)–positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone. Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade. The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.
          MethodsPatients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI. Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI. Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety.
          ResultsThree hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 vPP

"BackgroundNeuroinflammation causes neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Ipriflavone (IP), therapeutic compound to postmenopausal osteoporosis, has limited estrogenic activity and is accounted as AChE inhibitor. The developing of drug delivery systems to enable drug targeting to specific sites increases the drug therapeutic effect.
          ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to formulate and evaluate ipriflavone loaded albumin nanoparticles (IP-Np) along with free ipriflavone against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation in rats.
          MethodsNeuroinflammation was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p) injection of LPS (250 μg/kg rat body weight) then treatments were conducted with (1)(2)(3)
          ResultsA significant upsurge in inflammatory mediators and decline in antioxidant status were observed in LPS-induced rats. In one hand, ipriflavone (50 mg/kg), IP-Np and IP-Np-T80 ameliorated LPS induced brain hippocampal inflammation where they depreciated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and enhanced antioxidant status. In another hand, ipriflavone at dose (5 mg/kg) didn’t show the same therapeutic effect.
          ConclusionThe current study provides evidence for the potential neuroprotective effect of ipriflavone (50 mg/kg) against LPS-induced neuroinflammation in rats through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Moreover, nanoparticles significantly attenuated neuroinflammation in concentration lower than the effective therapeutic dose of free drug ten times.",0
"BackgroundDysregulation of lncRNAs is frequent in glioma and has emerged as an important mechanism involved in tumorigenesis. Previous analysis of Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database indicated that LBX2-AS1 expression is one of differentially expression lncRNA between lower grade glioma (LGG) (grade II and III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the function and mechanism of LBX2-AS1 in glioma has not been evaluated yet.
          MethodsHere, we analyzed the expression of LBX2-AS1 in GTEx data (normal brain), TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM. RT-PCR was performed to detect LBX2-AS1 in surgery obtained normal brain and glioma. CCK-8 kit and Annexin V-FITC-PI Apoptosis Detection Kit were used to study the function of LBX2-AS1 on glioma proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, western blotting and dual luciferase reporter assay were carried out to investigate the target miRNA of LBX2-AS1. The discovered mechanism was validated by the rescue assay.
          ResultsFollowing study of GTEx and TCGA data, LBX2-AS1 was significantly elevated in glioma compared with normal brain and in GBM compared with LGG. Higher expression of LBX2-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with glioma. Expression of LBX2-AS1 was positively correlated with pathology classification of glioma. Knockdown of LBX2-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in glioma. LBX2-AS1 have complimentary binding site for tumor suppressor miR-491-5p and we showed that LBX2-AS1 sponged miR-491-5p to upregulate TRIM28 expression in glioma cells. TRIM28 overexpression attenuated the effect of LBX2-AS1 knockdown on glioma cells.
          ConclusionsIn conclusion, LBX2-AS1 was an increased lncRNA in glioma. Mechanistically, LBX2-AS1 promoted glioma cell proliferation and resistance to cell apoptosis via sponging miR-491-5p.",0
"BackgroundMagnesium sulphate given to women immediately prior to very preterm birth protects the perinatal brain, so fewer babies die or develop cerebral palsy. How magnesium sulphate exerts these beneficial effects remains uncertain. The aim of the MagNUM Study was to assess the effect of exposure to antenatal magnesium sulphate on MRI measures of brain white matter microstructure at term equivalent age.
          MethodsNested cohort study within the randomised Magnesium sulphate at 30 to <34 weeks’ Gestational age Neuroprotection Trial (MAGENTA). Mothers at risk of preterm birth at 30 to <34 weeks’ gestation were randomised to receive either 4 g of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate [8 mmol magnesium ions], or saline placebo, infused over 30 min when preterm birth was planned or expected within 24 h. Participating babies underwent diffusion tensor MRI at term equivalent age. The main outcomes were fractional anisotropy across the white matter tract skeleton compared using Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), with adjustment for postmenstrual age at birth and at MRI, and MRI site. Researchers and families were blind to treatment group allocation during data collection and analyses.
          FindingsOf the 109 participating babies the demographics of the 60 babies exposed to magnesium sulphate were similar to the 49 babies exposed to placebo. In babies whose mothers were allocated to magnesium sulphate, fractional anisotropy was higher within the corticospinal tracts and corona radiata, the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi compared to babies whose mothers were allocated placebo (P
          InterpretationIn babies born preterm, antenatal magnesium sulphate exposure promotes development of white matter microstructure in pathways affecting both motor and cognitive function. This may be one mechanism for the neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulphate treatment prior to preterm birth.

"ObjectivesPreterm birth (PTB) occurs in 5% to 18% of newborns. However, the underlying inflammatory mechanisms have not been elucidated.
          MethodsWe established a mouse model of infection-associated PTB. Physical signs in pregnant mice with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment were observed, and the frequencies of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2- and TLR4-positive CD11b+ cells were analyzed. Cytokine levels in plasma and pathological changes were assessed following LPS treatment. A rescue experiment was used to probe potential immunologic mechanisms underlying PTB.
          ResultsLymphocyte infiltration could be observed in the placentas of mice following intrauterine injection with LPS. The percentage of inflammatory cells decreased 12 hours after treatment. Moreover, TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood cells was significantly increased 4 hours after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Peak TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood cells occurred 8 hours post-treatment. TLR4 and TLR-2/4 inhibitors reduced levels of interleukin-10, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α in peripheral blood and delayed PTB.

"BackgroundNight-shift workers experience circadian rhythm disruption, changes in sleep time duration, and effects on their eating habits. All these factors may be related to the release of inflammatory mediators and may affect oral inflammation and periodontal health status. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of sleep time duration on oral inflammation and periodontal health status in night-shift workers and non-night-shift workers.
          MethodsThis study involved two groups with 27 participants each: one group of night-shift workers and one group of non-night-shift workers. Examination of depth of pocket and bleeding on probing (BOP) was conducted with a periodontal probe. Non-stimulating saliva samples were collected to analyze the levels of melatonin, malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) using ELISA. Comparisons for each parameter were performed using independent t
          ResultsThe night-shift worker group had a short sleep time duration (p = 0.000). The salivary melatonin level of the night-shift workers was lower than that of the non-night-shift workers (p = 0.000). MDA, depth of pocket, and BOP were higher in the night-shift workers (p = 0.000). Only salivary melatonin showed a correlation with sleep time duration in the night-shift worker group (p < 0.05). Neither subject group showed an effect of sleep time duration on depth of pocket, BOP, salivary melatonin, MDA, or TNF-α (p > 0.05).
          ConclusionNight-shift workers showed higher rates of oral inflammation and periodontal health status, but there was no relationship between these factors and sleep time duration.",0

"ObjectiveResearchers have revealed the combined functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNA (miRNAs) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to understand the role of nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and miR-381 involving insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in PCOS.
          MethodsPCOS rat model was established by dehydroepiandrosterone induction. NEAT1, miR-381 and IGF1 expression in ovarian granulosa cells of PCOS patients and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were tested. Bioinformatics website and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were utilized to verify the relationship between NEAT1 and miR-381 and that between miR-381 and IGF1. Levels of sex hormone, pathological changes and ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were detected. Ovarian granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed in vitro.
          ResultsNEAT1 and IGF1 expression increased while miR-381 expression decreased in the ovarian granulosa cells of patients with PCOS and the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vivo experiments, interference with NEAT1 improved the levels of sex hormones, alleviated pathological changes and suppressed ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. In in vitro cell experiments, interference with NEAT1 suppressed apoptosis and enhanced cell proliferation of ovarian granulosa cells. NEAT1 interference-mediated effect would be reversed by up-regulating miR-381. NEAT1 acted as a ceRNA to adsorb miR-381 to target IGF1. Overexpression of IGF1 reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-381 on ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis.
          ConclusionInterference with NEAT1 increases miR-381 and reduces IGF1 levels, effectively improving the levels of sex hormones and reducing the pathological damage of ovarian tissue in rats with PCOS.

"Antiandrogens have demonstrated a protective effect for COVOD-19 patients in observational and interventional studies. The goal of this study was to determine if proxalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, could be an effective treatment for men with COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at two outpatient centers (Brasilia, Brazil). Patients were recruited from October 21 to December 24, 2020 (clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT04446429). Male patients with confirmed COVID-19 but not requiring hospitalization (COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale <3) were administered proxalutamide 200 mg/day or placebo for up to 7 days. The primary endpoint was hospitalization rate at 30 days post-randomization. A total of 268 men were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. 134 patients receiving proxalutamide and 134 receiving placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.2% in men taking proxalutamide compared to 26% in placebo, P < 0.001. The 30-day hospitalization risk ratio was 0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03–0.27.

"Background and objectiveThe effectiveness of deferred surgical repair of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) post-myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiogenic shock remains limited to case reports. Our study aimed to investigate the outcomes and survival analysis following mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients after VSR who develop cardiogenic shock.
          MethodsWe analyzed 27 patients with post-MI VSR and cardiogenic shock who received deferred surgical repair while stabilized on MCS between January 2018 and March 2020. After normality test adjustments, continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). These were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. To identify predictors of operative mortality, univariate analysis of clinical characteristics and interventions followed by logistic regression was carried out. P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
          ResultsAll patients had preoperative MCS. Emergency repair was avoided in all the patients. The mean age of the participants was 64.96 with the majority being males (74.1%). On average, the mean time from MI to VSR repair was 18.85 days. Delayed revascularization was associated with increased mortality (OR 17.500, 95% CI 2.365–129.506, P = 0.005). Other factors associated with increased mortality were ejection fraction (EF), three-vessel disease, Killip class, early surgery, and prolonged use of inotropes. The operative mortality was 11% with an overall mortality of 33.3%. The one-year survival rate was 66.7%.

"This study explored the effects involved in silencing CLIC4 on apoptosis and proliferation of mouse liver cancer Hca-F and Hca-P cells. A
CLIC4-target small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed to compound into two individual complementary oligonucleotide chains. A process
of annealing and connection to a pSilencer vector was followed by transfection with Hca-F and Hca-P cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction and Western blotting techniques were used to determine CLIC4 mRNA and protein expressions. CCK8 assay and flow cytometry
were employed for analysis of the survival and apoptosis rate as well as the cell cycle in an octreotide-induced apoptosis model. Expressions of
caspase 3, caspase 9, and cleaved PARP were measured using Western blotting. The CLIC4 mRNA and protein expressions in Hca-F and Hca-P
cells transfected by pSilencer-CLIC4 siRNA plasmid in the blank group displayed remarkably decreased levels of expression, when compared
with both the control and negative control (NC) groups. Decreased survival rates and cleaved PARP expression, increased cell apoptosis rate,
expressions of caspase 3 and caspase 9 in Hca-F and Hca-P cells were detected in groups that had been cultured in a medium containing

"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is considered to be one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders affecting women of reproductive age. CiRS-126, an innovative circular microRNA, has previously been proven to be a promising miR-21 sponge. However, a
proper understanding of the impact of ciRS-126 on PCOS is needed. Circular RNA (CiRS) profiles were initially evaluated in ovarian
cortex samples obtained from 18 women with PCOS as well from 9 women without PCOS. Insulin-induced ovarian granulosa cells
isolated from mice were utilized for the functional study. CiRS microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR indicated that ciRs126 expression was downregulated while miR-21 expression was upregulated in PCOS samples and insulin-induced granulosa cells as
compared with non-PCOS samples and non-insulin-induced granulosa cells. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of ciRS-126 was
associated with a reduction in proliferation and increased apoptosis in insulin-treated granulosa cells. Meanwhile, bioinformatic
prediction and the results of the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated the presence of consecutive binding in the ciRS-126-miR21-programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) axis. Moreover, overexpression of miR-21 blocked ciRS-126 repression of proliferation
and triggered the death of insulin-induced granulosa cells. Excessive PDCD4 expression counteracted the influence of miR-21 on cell
death and proliferation. The data indicated that PDCD4 played a regulatory role in ROS generation, which is reportedly involved in
apoptosis. Therefore, ciRS-126 reduction in PCOS granulosa cells targeted the miR-21-PDCD4 axis to reduce proliferation and
promote apoptosis. CiRS-126 shows potential as a promising predictor of clinical outcome as well as a therapeutic target in PCOS.

"Fire and high summer soil temperatures can break physical seed dormancy in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems. Their independent effect is somewhat recognized but both factors may act together with a synergistic effect yet unknown. This study aims to determine the isolated and combined effects of fire and summer temperatures on the release of physical seed dormancy in Cistaceae species. Fire and summer temperature treatments were applied in a factorial experiment to seeds of 12 species of Cistaceae. Seeds previously exposed or not to a heat shock (fire simulation) were kept for 1 or 2 months at constant or alternating temperatures (summer temperatures simulation). Additionally, I compared the effect of exposing the seeds to a heat shock before or after they had been subjected to the summer temperatures. Heat shock increased germination of all species, but summer temperatures produced different results. When seeds were exposed to summer temperatures after heat shock, germination decreased. This negative effect disappeared when heat shock was simulated at the end of the summer temperatures. Fire and summer temperatures modulate timing of germination in Cistaceae with a joint control on post-fire regeneration. Cycling of sensitivity to physical dormancy release may be the mechanism to explain this fine-tuning, which would ensure germination when environmental conditions are suitable for growth. These results contribute to our understanding of vegetation dynamics and postfire regeneration in Mediterranean ecosystems.

"Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is an endogenous lipid mediator that originated from docosahexaenoic acid that stimulates a bimodal mechanism in the anti-inflammatory activity in addition to regulation of the inflammatory reaction. The study aimed at
assessing the tissue level of RvD1 in psoriasis to study its role in the etiopathogenesis
of psoriasis, studying the action of NB-UVB on the level of resolvin D1 in psoriasis,
and raising the possibility of using resolvin D1 as a new therapy for psoriasis in the
future. This case-control study included 20 psoriasis patients and 20 healthy controls.
Patients took narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) for 36 sessions. Skin biopsies were
taken before and after treatment from patients and from controls to assess the
expression of RvD1 by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our findings revealed a statistically significant difference (P < .001) between psoriasis patients
(either before or after treatment) and controls with lower levels of RvD1 in psoriasis
patients. On comparing the RvD1 levels in psoriasis patients before and after treatment, a statistically significant increase was detected after treatment (P < .001). Tissue RvD1 levels in psoriasis patients were lower than healthy controls and increased
after NB-UVB treatment in psoriasis patients. Thus, it is suggested that RvD1 might
have a role in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis. Moreover, the significantly upregulated tissue levels of RvD1 in patients after treatment with NB-UVB highlighted
a novel mechanism of phototherapy-mediated response in psoriasis by up-regulating
RvD1 level.",0
"Abstract
While research has investigated intimate partner violence (IPV) and food insecurity (FI) as
independent experiences on mental health, research is lacking on the possible longitudinal
associations of combined experiences of IPV and FI on maternal depression and generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD). Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study
(n=1,440), the current study examined the independent and combined associations of IPV and FI
mothers experienced 3-5 years after their child’s birth on depression and GAD at Year 15. Five
mutually exclusive dichotomous variables were created based on IPV and FI experiences during
Year 3 and Year 5. Depression and GAD were measured at Year 15 using the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form. According to the covariate-adjusted logistic
regression models, exposure to IPV and FI, both concurrently and independently predicted greater
depression at Year 15. Mothers in all IPV and FI categories had greater odds of having GAD at
Year 15 compared to those with no exposure. Compared to the independent effect of IPV and FI,
the combined effect of IPV and FI was highly associated with maternal GAD, but not depression.
Using a trauma-informed approach to counseling in combination with food assistance programs
might be an effective strategy in preventing mental health symptoms. ",0
"Abstract. Methyl jasmonate potentially induces the
differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells and inhibits
their proliferation; it may induce the differentiation and
apoptosis of human lymphocytic leukemia cells, but does not
exert a damaging effect on normal lymphocytes. In the present
study, the anticancer effect of methyl jasmonate on human
colorectal cancer cells was investigated. Cell viability and
apoptosis was assessed using a Cell Counting kit-8 assay and
flow cytometry, respectively. Methyl jasmonate suppressed cell
viability and induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer
cells. Additionally, methyl jasmonate increased the activation
of caspase-3, inhibited the expression levels of enhancer
of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2)
and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human colorectal cancer.
Downregulation of EZH2 expression enhanced the anticancer
effect of methyl jasmonate on human colorectal cancer cells
through suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus,
EZH2 downregulation promotes the anticancer effect of
methyl jasmonate by inducing apoptosis in human colorectal
cancer cells through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.",0
"Prematurely born infants face unique risks, and the treatment of imminent preterm birth is thus an

"BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a common stroke sequela, yet their neurobiological substrates are still unclear. We
sought to determine if they are associated with specific lesion locations.
METHODS: In a prospective observational study, 270 patients with stroke were tested twice with the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale around day 6 and again 6 months poststroke and voxel-based lesion behavior mapping was performed.
RESULTS: Frequency of depressive symptoms (depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale >7)
after 6 months was 19.6 %. Higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for depression around day 6 were
the only variable associated with depressive symptoms after 6 months in a multiple logistic regression. Lesions in
the right putamen were significantly associated with depressive symptoms after 6 months in the voxel-based lesion
behavior mapping.
CONCLUSIONS: Lesions in the right basal ganglia might increase the risk of depressive symptoms 6 months poststroke.

"Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a group of viruses with small, circular DNA genomes. Members of this family are thought to
ubiquitously infect humans, although causal disease associations are currently lacking. At present, there is no understanding
of how infection with this diverse group of viruses is so prevalent. Using a combined computational and synthetic approach,
we predict and identify miRNA-coding regions in diverse human TTVs and provide evidence for TTV miRNA production in
vivo. The TTV miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer, and are active in RISC. A TTV
mutant defective for miRNA production replicates as well as wild type virus genome; demonstrating that the TTV miRNA is
dispensable for genome replication in a cell culture model. We demonstrate that a recombinant TTV genome is capable of
expressing an exogenous miRNA, indicating the potential utility of TTV as a small RNA vector. Gene expression profiling of
host cells identifies N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) as a target of a TTV miRNA. NMI transcripts are directly regulated
through a binding site in the 39UTR. SiRNA knockdown of NMI contributes to a decreased response to interferon signaling.
Consistent with this, we show that a TTV miRNA mediates a decreased response to IFN and increased cellular proliferation in
the presence of IFN. Thus, we add Annelloviridae to the growing list of virus families that encode miRNAs, and suggest that
miRNA-mediated immune evasion can contribute to the pervasiveness associated with some of these viruses.",0
"Abstract
Twenty-first birthday drinking is characterized by extreme alcohol consumption. Accumulating
evidence suggests that high-dose bingeing is related to structural brain changes and cognitive
deficits. This is particularly problematic in the transition from adolescence to adulthood when the
brain is still maturing, elevating the brain’s sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol intoxication.
Heavy drinking is associated with reduced structural integrity in the hippocampus and corpus
callosum and is accompanied by cognitive deficits. However, there is little research examining
changes in the human brain related to discrete heavy drinking episodes. The present study
investigated whether alcohol exposure during a 21
st birthday celebration would result in changes
to white matter microstructure by utilizing Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) measures and a
quasi-experimental design. By examining structural changes in the brain from pre- to postcelebration within subjects (N = 49) prospectively, we were able to more directly observe brain
changes following an extreme drinking episode. Region of interest analyses demonstrated
increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the posterior fornix (p < 0.0001) and in the body of the
corpus callosum (p = 0.0029) from pre- to post-birthday celebration. These results suggest acute
white matter damage to the fornix and corpus callosum following an extreme drinking episode,
which is especially problematic during continued neurodevelopment. Twenty-first birthday
drinking may, therefore, be considered an important target event for preventing acute brain
injury in young adults",0
"Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), a complex neuropsychological complication of cirrhosis, is characterized by delayed reaction time and the inhibition of
abnormal response. This network meta-analysis (NMA) was adopted to compare the
efficacy of five drugs including lactulose, probiotics, rifaximin, acetyl-L-carnitine
(ALC), and L-Ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) in the treatment of MHE. The Cochrane
Library, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for any existing entail on
these five drugs from the inception to February 2018, including Randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). The NMA of the five drugs, accounting for both direct and
indirect comparisons to assess WMD (weighted mean difference) and SUCRA
(surface under the cumulative ranking curves) was conducted. In total, 10 RTCS with
826 MHE patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA. The
meta-analysis revealed that compared with placebo, lactulose, and probiotics had
better efficacy in reducing ammonia serum levels and total SIP (Sickness Impact
Profil) score; ALC had better efficacy in lowering serum level of ammonia and
increasing the serum level of albumin; rifaximin and LOLA had better efficacy in
reducing total SIP score. The results from SUCRA revealed that in terms of ammonia
and albumin serums, ALC presented with the highest rankings when it comes to
efficacy (serum ammonia: 87.2%; serum albumin: 92.25%). Hence, the key findings
from the present study highly suggested that ALC had the best efficacy in the
treatment of MHE patients.",0
"Abstract
Background: Infertility affects childbearing age couples all over the world. One of the important reasons for infertility is genetic
factors. Our study evaluated the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and azoospermia.
Methods: Multiple databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and China journal full-text database were used to search
for relevant studies, and full-text articles involved in the evaluation of MTHFR and azoospermia. The results were evaluated using
STATA 12.0. Heterogeneity analysis, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis were also performed on the data.
Results: Thirteen related studies eventually met the inclusion criteria. Significant association between C677T polymorphism and
azoospermia (relative risk [RR]=0.94 [0.90, 0.99], I
2=60.9%, P=.002), and between A1298C polymorphism and azoospermia
(RR=0.98 [0.94, 1.02], I
2=56.3%, P=.011) was observed. Meanwhile, in subgroup analysis, Caucasians had higher risk than
Mongolians in association between MTHFR and azoospermia.
Conclusion: There was association between MTHFR polymorphism and azoospermia. Caucasian populations had higher risk
than Mongolian populations in association between MTHFR and azoospermia.

"Objective: Well-tested and validated theories of suicide can help professionals
understand, predict, and prevent suicide. This article presents two studies testing
the suicidal ideation components of the Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide and
comparing it to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS). We tested the 3ST’s
prediction that high levels of pain and hopelessness lead to suicidal ideation, which
strengthens when pain and hopelessness outweigh connection to life.
Method: Study 1 (n = 204, mean age = 35, 56% female, 83% White) provides an
independent, direct replication of the original analyses. Study 2 (n = 295, mean
age = 25, 75% female, 68% White) presents the first conceptual extension of the
3ST using diverse measures of pain, hopelessness, and connection. In both studies,
participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing the relevant variables.
Results: Both studies largely supported the first two steps of the 3ST, although
adding connection to the model did not account for greater variability of suicidal
ideation. The ITS accounted for comparable or greater amounts of variance in
suicidal ideation than the 3ST.
Conclusions: Both the 3ST and the ITS have utility to explain suicidal ideation.
Limitations and future directions are discussed",0
"This study is designed to investigate the role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) on the proliferation
and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in rat models with focal cerebral infarction (CI). Seventy-five Sprague-Dawlay (SD) rats were
randomly divided into the control, sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), MCAO þ nonsense oligonucleotide (NODN), and
MCAO þ ASODN groups. Proliferation and differentiation of NSCs were detected by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and immunofluorescence
staining, respectively. ELISA was performed to detect the expressions of endogenous factors that include insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), transforming growth factor-a1 (TGF-a1), bFGF,
and nerve growth factor (NGF). Results show significant neurological deficits and focal CI in the MCAO and MCAO þ NODN groups. An
obvious increase of NSC proliferation, reactive proliferation of astrocytes in CI areas, differentiation of newly proliferated NSCs into mature
neuronal cells, and expressions of endogenous growth factors exhibited in the MCAO, MCAO þ NODN and MCAO þ ASODN groups. Compared
to the MCAO and MACO þ NODN groups, the MCAO þ ASODN group showed a significant decrease NSC proliferation and differentiation in CI
areas as well as decrease expressions of endogenous growth factors. These findings may offer insight to help us understand more as to how
bFGF ASODN can effectively suppress the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. These findings are expected to help contribute to research
for new targets in the treatment of focal CI. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3875–3882, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
"Abstract
Purpose Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common infection in children, generally caused by viral respiratory
infection. Vitamin C is currently proposed as prophylaxis for URTI. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness
of vitamin C administration in children for the prevention and reduced duration of URTI through a systematic literature review.
Methods Review of the literature conducted between October 2017 and January 2018 in the main medical databases
(CENTRAL, Medline and Embase) and by a gray literature approach. The selection criteria were: double-blind randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamin C use to placebo in children aged 3 months to 18 years without chronic infection.
Efficacy was assessed in terms of incidence, duration and severity of symptoms of URTI. A meta-analysis was conducted where
possible.
Results Eight RCTs, including 3135 children aged 3 months to 18 years, were selected. Quantitative analysis showed no
difference between vitamin C administration and placebo (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% CI [0.54–1.03], p = 0.07, I2 = 74%). Vitamin
C administration was found to decrease the duration of URTI by 1.6 days (standardized mean differences = −0.30 [−0.53; −0.08],
p = 0.009, I2 = 70%). Children under 6 years of age benefit from more effective vitamin C supplementation associated with
echinacea. No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions Although no preventive effects were found, vitamin C intake reduced the duration of URTI. Considering the
frequency of URTI, the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, and the safe nature of vitamin C, its supplementation is justified,
especially in children under 6 years of age and those who present a high frequency of URTI. There is a sound rationale for further
trials with greater statistical power among children of this age.",0
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding
RNA sex determination region of Y chromosome
(SRY)-related HMG-box (SOX) is involved in the
development of various cancers. However, the
molecular mechanism of SOXOT, an overlapping transcript of SOX, in pancreatic cancer (PC)
is still undefined. We aimed to explore the epigenetic function of SOX2OT and its downstream
factors in advanced PC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The levels of SOX2OT, miRNA, and DEK proto-oncogene (DEK) in
pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines were
evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The log-rank test was applied to
evaluate the role of high SOX2OT levels in shortening the overall survival of pancreatic cancer
patients. The Chi-squared test was made to assess the relation between SOX2OT expression
and clinicopathological features of PC patients.
Colony assay tested the cell proliferation of PC
cells with SOX2OT knockdown. Flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to determine
the stemness of tumor cells in vitro. The underlying regulatory mechanism between SOX2OT
and miR-200a/141 was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by RNA transfection, qPCR, and
Western blotting. Mice xenograft models were
applied to determine the promoting effects of
SOX2OT on PC in vivo.
RESULTS: The expression of SOX2OT in PC
tissues and cell lines is strongly elevated. High
levels of SOX2OT expression are more likely to present in patients with advanced TNM
stage, positive CD44, and poor overall survival. SOX2OT overexpression promotes proliferation and stemness maintaining of PC cells in
vitro and boosts tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, SOX2OT upregulates DEK expression by
binding to miR-200a/141 as a competing endogenous RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: DEK induced by SOXOTmiR-200a/141 axis may markedly promote stem
cell property of PC, resulting in an advanced
stage and inferior survival. These findings suggest the SOX2OT-DEK axis as a novel therapeutic target in PC.",0
"Rationale: Direct evidence for persistence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) during asymptomatic latent tuberculosis infection
(LTBI) in humans is currently lacking. Moreover, although a 12-week
regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP) is currently
recommended by the CDC as treatment for LTBI, experimental
evidence for 3HP-mediated clearance of persistent Mtb infection
in human lungs has not been established.
Objectives: Using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of TB, we
sought to assess 3HP treatment–mediated clearance of Mtb infection
in latently infected macaques.
Methods: Sixteen NHPs were infected via inhalation with z10 cfu
of Mtb CDC1551, after which asymptomatic animals were either
treated with 3HP or left untreated. Pharmacokinetics of the 3HP
regimen were measured. Following treatment, animals were
coinfected with simian immunodeficiency virus to assess reactivation
of LTBI and development of active TB disease.
Measurements and Main Results: Fourteen NHPs
remained free of clinical signs or microbiological evidence of
active TB following infection with Mtb and were subsequently
either treated with 3HP (n = 7) or left untreated (n = 7).
Untreated NHPs were asymptomatic for 7 months but
harbored persistent Mtb infection, as shown by reactivation
of latent infection following simian immunodeficiency
virus coinfection. However, none of the treated
animals developed TB reactivation disease, and they
remained without clinical or microbiological evidence of
persistent bacilli, suggesting treatment-mediated clearance
of bacteria.
Conclusions: Mtb can persist in asymptomatic macaques for at
least 7 months. Furthermore, 3HP treatment effectively cleared
bacteria and prevented reactivation of TB in latently infected
macaques.

"Abstract: Layered two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), as an outstanding MXene member, has
captured increasing attention in supercapacitor applications due to its excellent chemical and physical
properties. However, the low gravimetric capacitance of Ti3C2Tx restricts its rapid development in
such applications. Herein, this work demonstrates an effective and facile hydrothermal approach
to synthesize nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx with greatly improved gravimetric
capacitance and excellent cycling stability. The hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) in hydrothermal
environment acted as the nitrogen source and intercalants, while the Ti3C2Tx itself was the titanium
source of TiO2 and TiN. We tested the optimized nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx
electrodes in H2SO4, Li2SO4, Na2SO4, LiOH and KOH electrolytes, respectively. The electrode in
H2SO4 electrolyte delivered the best electrochemical performance with high gravimetric capacitance
of 361 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 85.8% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.
A systematic study of material characterization combined with the electrochemical performances
disclosed that TiO2/TiN nanoparticles, the introduction of nitrogen and the NH4
+ intercalation
efficaciously increased the specific surface areas, which is beneficial for facilitating electrolyte ions
transportation. Given the excellent performance, nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3C2Tx
bodes well as a promising pseudocapacitor electrode for energy storage applications.",0
"Objective: This study aimed to describe the mechanism of exosome-derived miR-486-
5p underlying the cell cycle and progression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
Methods: Bioinformatics methods were applied for identifying the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) in the GEO-LUAD dataset, predicting where the potential target
miRNA was expressed and exploring the corresponding downstream target mRNA.
qRT-PCR was conducted to detect the levels of the target genes in cancer cells.
Thereafter, a series of in vitro experiments were performed for cell activities evaluation,
including CCK-8, EdU, colony formation assay and transwell. Besides, Western blot
was applied to determine the protein levels of the migration and invasion-related
factors (NEK2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, MMP-2, and MMP-9). Dual-luciferase
reporter gene assay was employed for validating the targeted relationship between
the target genes. Furthermore, nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment was
conducted to further validate the role of the target miRNA in tumor development, and
immunohistochemistry was used for Ki67 detection and TUNEL was applied for cell
apoptosis assay.
Results: miR-486-5p was observed to be enriched in serum exosomes, and seen
to be significantly down-regulated in cancer tissues as well as in cancer serum
exosomes. It was proven that exosomes could release miR-486-5p, thus regulating
LUAD progression and affecting cell cycle. Moreover, NEK2 was identified as a target of
miR-486-5p both in vivo and in vitro. Enrichment analysis revealed that NEK2 was mainly
activated in cell cycle and mitosis-related pathways. Meanwhile, NEK2 was found to
present significant difference in different TNM stages. Furthermore, rescue experiments
indicated that the inhibitory effect of miR-486-5p overexpression on LUAD progression
could be abrogated when miR-486-5p and NEK2 were simultaneously up-regulated.
Conclusion: Exosome-derived miR-486-5p is responsible for cell cycle arrest as well
as the inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis in LUAD via targeting NEK2.",0
"Abstract
Background
Loss-of-function mutations in the skin barrier protein filaggrin (FLG) are a major risk for atopic dermatitis (AD). The pathogenic sequence of disturbances in skin barrier function before or during the early development of AD is not fully understood. A more detailed understanding of these events is needed to develop a clearer picture of disease pathogenesis. A robust, noninvasive test to identify babies at high risk of AD would be important in planning early intervention and/or prevention studies.

Objectives
To ascertain whether a noninvasive measurement of skin barrier function at day 2 after birth and at 2 months predicts the development of AD at 1 year. Furthermore, to determine whether increases in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) predate the development of clinical AD.

Methods
A total of 1903 infants were enrolled in the Cork Babies After Scope: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact Using Neurological and Nutritional Endpoints Birth Cohort study from July 2009 to October 2011. Measurements of TEWL were made at birth (day 2) and at 2 and 6 months. The presence of AD was ascertained at 6 and 12 months, and disease severity was assessed by using the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis clinical tool at 6 months and by using both the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis clinical tool and Nottingham Severity Score at 12 months. A total of 1300 infants were genotyped for FLG mutations.

Results
At 6 months, 18.7% of the children had AD, and at 12 months, 15.53%. In a logistic regression model, day 2 upper quartile TEWL measurement was significantly predictive of AD at 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81; P < .05). Lowest quartile day 2 TEWL was protective against AD at 12 months. An upper quartile 2 month TEWL was also strongly predictive of AD at 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84; P < .05). At both ages, this effect was independent of parental atopy, FLG status, or report of an itchy flexural rash at 2 months. Associations were increased when parental atopy status or child FLG mutation status was added into the linear regression model.

Conclusions
Impairment of skin barrier function at birth and at 2 months precedes clinical AD. In addition to providing important mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis, these findings have implications for the optimal timing of interventions for the prevention of AD.",0
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Reduced expression
of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)
is associated with a variety of tumors. The elevated miR-155 expression is associated with the
onset of pancreatic cancer. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a targeted relation between miR155 and the 3'-UTR of SOCS3. This study investigated whether miR-155 regulates SOCS3 expression and affects the biological effects of
pancreatic cancer cells.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: QRT-PCR was
used to detect the expression of miR-155 and
SCOS3 mRNA in tumor tissues and paracancerous tissues of patients with pancreatic cancer.
The dual luciferase reporter gene assay validated the target interaction between miR-155 and
SOCS3. Pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 cells
were divided into miR-NC group and miR-155
inhibitor group followed by an analysis of the
expressions of SOCS3, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3,
cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, and cell proliferation by EdU staining.
RESULTS: Compared with adjacent tissues,
miR-155 expression was increased in tumor tissues of patients with pancreatic cancer, and
SOCS3 expression was decreased. There was a
targeted regulatory relationship between miR155 and SOCS3 mRNA. Compared with HPDE6-C7 cells, miR-155 expression in pancreatic cancer SW1990 and Capan-1 cells was increased, and SOCS3 expression was decreased.
Transfection of miR-155 inhibitor significantly
increased SOCS3 expression in pancreatic cancer SW1990 cells, decreased the expression of
p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, increased cell apoptosis,
and decreased cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased miR-155 expression and decreased SOCS3 expression are related to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.
miR-155 inhibits the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells by inhibition of
SOCS3 expression.",0
"Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is often assumed to be
one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly
and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian
herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life
stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that
involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides
and exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types
to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We
found that distance- and density-dependent mortality caused by natural enemies was most likely at the seedling stage and was greater at higher mean
annual temperatures. Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence
at the seedling stage is significantly weakened when fungicides were applied.
By contrast, negative conspecific distance- and density-dependence is not a
general pattern at the seed stage. High seed mass reduced distance- and
density-dependent mortality at the seed stage. Seed studies excluding only
large mammals found significant negative conspecific distance-dependent
mortality, but exclusion of all mammals resulted in a non-significant effect
of conspecifics. Our study suggests that plant pathogens are a major cause
of distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, while the
impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed
stage, large and small mammals, respectively, weaken and enhance negative
conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify
specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different
enemy types and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and
thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.",0
"Deciphering the mechanisms involved in shaping social structure is key to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes leading to sociality. Individual specialization within groups can increase colony efficiency and consequently productivity. Here, we test the hypothesis that within-group variation in individual personalities (i.e. boldness and aggression) can shape task differentiation. The social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae) showed task differentiation (significant unequal participation) in simulated prey capture events across 10-day behavioural assays in the field, independent of developmental stage (level of maturation), eliminating age polyethism. Participation in prey capture was positively associated with level of boldness but not with aggression. Body size positively correlated with being the first spider to emerge from the colony as a response to prey capture but not with being the first to attack, and dispersal distance from experimental colonies correlated with attacking but not with emerging. This suggests that different behavioural responses to prey capture result from a complex set of individual characteristics. Boldness and aggression correlated positively, but neither was associated with body size, developmental stage or dispersal distance. Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social spider independent of age and maturation. Our results suggest that personality measures obtained in solitary, standardized laboratory settings can be reliable predictors of behaviour in a social context in the field. Given the wealth of organisms that show consistent individual behavioural differences, animal personality could play a role in social organization in a diversity of animals.",0
"Abstract. The present systematic review and meta‑analysis
investigated the association between exposure to radiofre‑

studies that were available in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane
Library, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science,
Airiti Library, Networked Digital Library of Theses and
Dissertations and ProQuest until May 2020 were investi‑
gated. A total of eight studies (four case‑control and four
cohort studies) were eligible for quantitative analysis. A
significant association between radiofrequency radiation
exposure and breast cancer risk was detected [pooled relative
risk (RR)=1.189; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.056‑1.339].
Subgroup analyses indicated that radiofrequency radiation
exposure significantly increased the risk of breast cancer
susceptibility among subjects aged ≥50 years (RR=2.179;
95% CI, 1.260‑3.770). Pooled estimates revealed that the use
of electrical appliances, which emit radiofrequency radiation,
such as mobile phones and computers, significantly increased
breast cancer development (RR=2.057; 95% CI, 1.272‑3.327),
while occupational radiofrequency exposure and transmitters
did not increase breast cancer development (RR=1.274; 95%
CI, 0.956‑1.697; RR=1.133; 95% CI, 0.987‑1.300, respectively).
It was concluded that radiofrequency radiation exposure
significantly increased the risk of breast cancer, especially in
women aged ≥50 years and in individuals who used electric
appliances, such as mobile phones and computers. In accor‑
dance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta‑analysis, an evaluation protocol was prepared

"Introduction. Malpositioning of the implant results in polyethylene wear and loosing of implant afer total knee arthroplasty.
Scanogram is ofen used for measurement of limb alignment. Computer navigation provides real time measurements and thus,
the aim is to see any association pre- and postoperatively between coronal alignments measured on scanogram to computer
navigation during total knee arthroplasty. Material and Methods. We prospectively gathered data of 200 patients with advanced
degenerative symptomatic arthritis, who were consecutively selected for primary total knee arthroplasty with computer navigation.
Every patient’s pre- and postoperative scanogram were compared to the intraoperative computer navigation fndings. Results. Te
results show that the preoperative mean mechanical axis on navigation was 10.65∘ (SD ± 6.95) and on scanogram it was 10.38∘ (SD
± 6.89). On the other hand, the mean postoperative mechanical axis on navigation was 0.69∘ (SD ± 0.87) and on scanogram it was
2.73∘ (SD ± 2.10). Preoperatively, there was no signifcant diference (p value = 0.46) between the two. However, the postoperative
outcomes suggest that there was a noteworthy diference, with no correlation between the mean Hip-Knee Ankle Axis (HKA)
and intraoperative mechanical axis (p value <0.0001). Conclusion. Postoperative mechanical alignment values afer total knee
arthroplasty are lower on navigation than measured on standing full length hip to ankle scanogram",0
"Hydrostatin-SN1 (peptide sequence, DEQHLETELHTLTSVLTANGFQ), a kind of peptides extracted from snake venom, has been
reported to have anti-inflammatory effect, but its truncated mutant hydrostatin-SN10 (peptide sequence, DEQHLETELH) on
pancreatitis-induced acute lung injury has not been well documented. Interleukin- (IL-) 6-induced Janus Kinase 2/Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway is involved with inflammatory and oxidative stress
activities and may be associated with the pathogenesis of lung injury, and related molecules were measured. Taurocholateinduced pancreatitis associated with acute lung injury was established and treated with hydrostatin-SN10. Pancreatitis was
confirmed by measuring the serum levels of amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen and urinary amylase. Lung injury was determined
by histologically assessing acinar cell changes. The related molecules of IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT3-associated inflammation and
oxidative stress were quantitated by real time-PCR, Western blot, and/or immunochemical assay. Hydrostatin-SN10 reduced the
levels of serum amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen and urinary amylase when compared with the model group (p < 0:05).
Hydrostatin-SN10 significantly inhibited the IL-6-stimulated JAK2/STAT3 pathway and reduced the number of apoptotic cells
via the downregulation of caspase 3 and BAX (proapoptotic) and upregulation of Bcl2 (antiapoptotic) (p < 0:05). IL-6 induced
the increase in the levels of JAK2 and STAT3, which was reversed by hydrostatin-SN10 treatment (p < 0:05). In addition,
hydrostatin-SN10 reduced the expression of IL-6 and TNF- (tumor necrosis factor-) α and increased the level of IL-10 (p < 0:05).
On the other hand, hydrostatin-SN10 treatment increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione
(GSH) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p < 0:05). These results suggest that
hydrostatin-SN10 may inhibit pancreatitis-induced acute lung injury by affecting IL-6-mediated JAK2/STAT3 pathwayassociated inflammation and oxidative stress",0
"Abstract
Understanding the pharmacological similarity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is paramount to predicting ligand off-target effects, drug repurposing, and ligand discovery for orphan receptors. Phylogenetic relationships do not always correctly capture pharmacological similarity. Previous family-wide attempts to define pharmacological relationships were based on three-dimensional structures and/or known receptor:ligand pairings, both unavailable for orphan GPCRs. Here, we present GPCR-CoINPocket, a novel contact-informed neighboring pocket metric of GPCR binding site similarity that is informed by patterns of ligand:residue interactions observed in crystallographically-characterized GPCRs. GPCR-CoINPocket is applicable to receptors with unknown structure or ligands and accurately captures known pharmacological relationships between GPCRs, even those undetected by phylogeny. When applied to orphan receptor GPR37L1, GPCR-CoINPocket identified its pharmacological neighbors, and transfer of their pharmacology aided discovery of the first surrogate ligands for this orphan with a 30% success rate. Although primarily designed for GPCRs, the method is easily transferable to other protein families.

Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are well-established therapeutic targets, yet a subgroup of them remains largely unexplored – orphan GPCRs. One of the main obstacles to understanding the therapeutic potential of orphan GPCRs is the absence of a cognate ligand, which is identified through ‘deorphanization’1. While finding the endogenous ligand is of paramount importance, much can be learned by the identification of even low potency small molecule surrogate ligands. The propensity of ligands to display ‘off-target’ activities provides rationale for surrogate ligand searches by screening clinically tested small molecules2–4. Nevertheless, screening campaigns remain expensive and often inaccessible to academic research, while structure-based drug design at orphan GPCRs is still in its infancy5. Thus, alternative approaches to surrogate ligand identification are required.

Given that a number of homology-related receptor subgroups, such as the muscarinic or adrenergic receptors, share endogenous and often small molecule ligands, pharmacologically-characterized receptors that are homologous to an orphan GPCR in question represent an obvious source of surrogate ligand candidates. Such homologs are traditionally determined by sequence alignment and calculation of amino acid identity or similarity at each position. Phylogenetic relationships are largely sensible6 and underlie classification systems for the wider GPCR superfamily7; however, they are not always predictive of pharmacological similarities. Phylogenetically-unrelated GPCRs frequently share ligands; for example, astemizole, an antagonist of the bioaminergic histamine H1 receptor, also antagonizes the somatostatin peptide receptor (sst) 5, sst58,9. On the other hand, homology-related receptors frequently differ substantially in their ligand selectivity (exemplified by the chemokine receptor subfamily10).

A breakthrough in understanding pharmacological relatedness of GPCRs came from arranging GPCRs by their ligand similarities11. This chemogenomics approach not only explained known ‘off-target’ effects of certain ligands, but also predicted relationships unseen by phylogeny alone. These newly-predicted relationships were experimentally validated, extending previous computational efforts to organize GPCRs by their ligand similarity12. Although a major advance in the field, the approach cannot identify pharmacological neighbors for orphan GPCRs because it relies upon existing ligand:receptor pairings.

Intuitively, pharmacological similarity of GPCRs implies similar binding-site features. However, various attempts at organizing GPCRs by binding site comparisons largely reproduced phylogenetic relationships11–15. This may reflect shortcomings in the definitions of the binding site, which lack sufficient texture to reveal the true ligand interaction pharmacophores. Here we sought to further refine the comparisons of GPCR binding sites by analyzing both the persistence and strength of residue:ligand interactions observed across the GPCR Pocketome – the set of annotated GPCR binding pockets that have been crystallographically characterized to date16. By enriching the binding site comparisons with ligand contact strengths, a method we term GPCR-CoINPocket (GPCR contact-informed neighboring pocket), we organized and clustered all Class A GPCRs into a hierarchical structure that closely reproduced previously characterized pharmacological relationships. Furthermore, we discovered the first surrogate ligands for the orphan receptor GPR37L1 by transferring pharmacology of its neighbors identified by GPCR-CoINPocket. Hence, our approach not only complements the phylogenetic and pharmacological organization of GPCRs, but also uniquely enables the discovery of surrogate ligands for orphan receptors.",0
"Abstract
The ether à go-go1 (Eag1) channel is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. However, the expression and function of Eag1 in liposarcoma are poorly understood. In the present study, the mRNA expression of Eag1 in different adipose tissue samples was examined by real-time PCR. Then, the protein expression of Eag1 in 131 different adipose tissues from 109 patients was detected by immunohistochemistry. Next, the associations between Eag1 expression and clinicopathological features of liposarcoma were analyzed. In addition, the effects of Eag1 on liposarcoma cell proliferation and cycle were evaluated by CCK-8, colony formation, xenograft mouse model, and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was detected by Western blot analysis to explain the detailed mechanisms of oncogenic potential of Eag1 in liposarcoma. It was found that Eag1 was aberrantly expressed in over 67% liposarcomas, with a higher frequency than in lipoma, hyperplasia, inflammation, and normal adipose tissues. However, Eag1 expression was not correlated with clinicopathological features of liposarcoma. Eag1 inhibitor imipramine or Eag1-shRNA significantly suppressed the proliferation of liposarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanying with accumulation of cells in the G1 phase. These results suggest that Eag1 plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and cell cycle of liposarcoma cells and might be a potential therapeutic target for liposarcoma.",0

"Abstract
No data support the suggestion that first-trimester dydrogesterone use increases the risk of fetal abnormalities; however, two low-quality retrospective studies (one retracted by the journal) have suggested such a link. A scoping review and meta-analysis were carried out to address this discrepancy. The literature was reviewed but it was not possible to identify any evidence of a plausible mechanism for potential causality between dydrogesterone and fetal abnormalities. To investigate whether any evidence existed, a preliminary meta-analysis was undertaken of clinical studies published since 2005 on first-trimester dydrogesterone use with assessment of fetal abnormalities. A fixed effects model was used to determine pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). From 83 articles identified, six randomized controlled trials were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for maternal dydrogesterone use and fetal abnormalities gave a RR approaching 1 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.57, 1.62), confirming previous conclusions of no causal association between fetal abnormalities and first-trimester dydrogesterone use. Physicians, scientists and journal reviewers should exercise due diligence to prevent promulgation of retracted data. We are confident in using dydrogesterone, if indicated, in the treatment of threatened or recurrent miscarriage, and believe that its favourable safety profile should extend to its appropriate use in assisted reproductive technologies.",0

Background
Obesity is a global disease with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese according to the world health organization figures. This paper aims to explore the links between obesity and mortality in COVID-19.

Methods
Electronic search was made for the papers studying obesity as a risk factor for mortality following COVID-19 infection. Three authors independently selected the papers and agreed for final inclusion. The outcomes were the age, gender, body mass index, severe comorbidities, respiratory support and the critical illness related mortality in COVID-19. 572 publications were identified and 42 studies were selected including one unpublished study data. Only 14 studies were selected for quantitative analysis.

Results
All the primary points but the gender are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality. The age >70, [odd ratio (OR): 0.17, CI; 95%, P-value: <0.00001], gender [OR: 0.89; CI: 95%, P-value: 0.32], BMI > 25 kg/m2 [OR: 3.68, CI: 95%, P-value: <0.003], severe comorbidities [OR: 1.84, CI:95%, P-value: <0.00001], advanced respiratory support [OR: 6.98, CI: 95%, P-value: <0.00001], and critical illness [OR: 2.03, CI: 95%, P-value: <0.00001].

Conclusions
Patients with obesity are at high risk of mortality from COVID-19 infection.",0

Background
Stem cell therapy is a potential strategy to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, several practical limitations remain. As such, finding the appropriate stem cell remains the primary issue in regenerative medicine today. We isolated a pre-placental pluripotent stem cell from the chorionic villi of women with early tubal ectopic pregnancies. Our objectives in this study were (i) to identify the characteristics of hTS cells as a potential cell source for therapy; and (ii) to test if hTS cells can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD.

Methods and Findings
hTS cells expressed gene markers of both the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). hTS cells exhibited genetic and biological characteristics similar to that of hES cells, yet genetically distinct from placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) efficiently induced hTS cells into trophoblast neural stem cells (tNSCs) in 1-day. Overexpression of transcription factor Nanog was possibly achieved through a RA-induced non-genomic c-Src/Stat3/Nanog signaling pathway mediated by the subcellular c-Src mRNA localization for the maintenance of pluripotency in tNSCs. tNSC transplantation into the lesioned striatum of acute and chronic PD rats not only improved behavioral deficits but also regenerated dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, evidenced by immunofluorescent and immunohistological analyses at 18-weeks. Furthermore, tNSCs showed immunological advantages for the application in regenerative medicine.

Conclusions
We successfully isolated and characterized the unique ectopic pregnancy-derived hTS cells. hTS cells are pluripotent stem cells that can be efficiently induced to tNSCs with positive results in PD rat models. Our data suggest that the hTS cell is a dynamic stem cell platform that is potentially suitable for use in disease models, drug discovery, and cell therapy such as PD.",0
"Abstract
Objectives: Investigate and identify the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance measured by using different cognitive tests taken from Cambridge Brain Science (CBS).

Methods: Thirty subjects, divided into two groups (aerobic and effort), undergo twelve cognitive tests from CBS. A comparison between the pre- and post-exercise results in terms of cognitive performance differences is carried out. Regression analysis between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features and CBS tests results is performed.

Results: In most CBS tests, there is an improvement, or at least a confirmation, of the subject's cognitive ability, for both groups. Reasoning (80–100%), concentration (80–87%), and planning tests (93–100%) seem to undergo critical positive changes. The regression analysis, performed by using a set of different algorithms, has demonstrated that it is possible, by monitoring the HRV during the exercise, to predict to some extent the cognitive performance, i.e., the CBS tests results. The best performing regression algorithms are Simple Linear (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.098, effort group: 3.350, both groups: 2.747) and REPTree (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.955, effort group: 3.315, both groups: 3.121). The statistical analysis has proved that physical activity is statistically useful for the subjects in improving their cognitive performance.

Conclusions: This study has numerically appraised the improvement, the conservation, or the worsening on different aspects of cognition. The found mathematical relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance suggests that it is possible to predict the beneficial effect of various exercises on executive and attentive control.

■ Selection mechanisms that dynamically gate only relevant
perceptual information for further processing and sustained
representation in working memory are critical for goal-directed
behavior. We examined whether this gating process can be
modulated by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) over left dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC)—a region known
to play a key role in working memory and conscious access.
Specifically, we examined the effects of tDCS on the magnitude
of the so-called “attentional blink” (AB), a deficit in identifying
the second of two targets presented in rapid succession. Thirtyfour participants performed a standard AB task before (baseline), during, and after 20 min of 1-mA anodal and cathodal
tDCS in two separate sessions. On the basis of previous reports
linking individual differences in AB magnitude to individual differences in DLPFC activity and on suggestions that effects of
tDCS depend on baseline brain activity levels, we hypothesized
that anodal tDCS over left DLPFC would modulate the magnitude of the AB as a function of individual baseline AB magnitude. Indeed, individual differences’ analyses revealed that
anodal tDCS decreased the AB in participants with a large baseline AB but increased the AB in participants with a small baseline AB. This effect was only observed during (but not after)
stimulation, was not found for cathodal tDCS, and could not
be explained by regression to the mean. Notably, the effects
of tDCS were not apparent at the group level, highlighting
the importance of taking individual variability in performance
into account when evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS. These
findings support the idea that left DLPFC plays a critical role in
the AB and in conscious access more generally. They are also in
line with the notion that there is an optimal level of prefrontal
activity for cognitive function, with both too little and too much
activity hurting performance. ■",0

Background
In order to explore the possibility of treating breast cancer by local photo-therapy, a photothermal agents loaded in situ hydrogel was established. In detail, The Cu2MnS2 nanoplates were prepared by one-pot synthesis and, the thermosensitive Pluronic F127 was used as the hydrogel matrix. The Cu2MnS2 nanoplates and the hydrogel were characterized by morphous, particle size, serum stability, photothermal performance upon repeated 808 nm laser irradiation as well as the rheology features. The therapeutic effects of the Cu2MnS2 nanoplates and the hydrogel were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells. The retention, photothermal efficacy, therapeutic effects and systemic toxicity of the hydrogel were assessed in tumor bearing mouse model.

Results
The Cu2MnS2 nanoplates with a diameter of about 35 nm exhibited satisfying serum stability, photo-heat conversion ability and repeated laser exposure stability. The hydrogel encapsulation did not negatively influence the above features of the photothermal agent. The nanoplates loaded in situ hydrogel shows a phase transition at body temperature and, as a result, a long retention in vivo.

Conclusions
The photothermal agent embedded hydrogel played a promising photothermal therapeutic effects in tumor bearing mouse model with low systemic toxicity after peritumoral administration.",0
"Abstract
We report a facile design of an ultra-thin broadband metamaterial absorber (MA) for C-band applications by utilizing a single layer of a metal-dielectric-metal structure of FR-4 substrate. The absorption performances are characterized using a numerical method. The proposed MA exhibits the broadband absorption response over the entire C-band spectrum range from 4.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz with absorptivity above 90% and the high absorptivity is remained over 80% for a large incident angle up to 40° under both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations over the band. The origin of absorption mechanism is explained by the electric and surface current distributions, which is also supported by the retrieved constitutive electromagnetic parameters, significantly affected by magnetic resonance. In addition, compared with the previous reports, the proposed MA presents a greater practical feasibility in term of low-profile and wide incident angle insensitivity, suggesting that the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for C-band applications.",0

Background
One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) has exponentially increased in the last decade, as it is associated with very low complications, mortality, readmissions and reoperations rates, and shows excellent short- and long-term benefits of weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short- and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution.

Methods
A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed.

Results
600 patients were included in the study, 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5 years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 5 years (p < 0.001, respectively). At 5 years, OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (p = 0.027), HT (p = 0.006), and DL (p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (p < 0.001).

Conclusion
OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 5 years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB. RYGB and SG obtain similar T2DM and HT remissions, but RYGB reaches significantly greater rates of DL remission. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03467646.",0
"Prior research indicates that disguise negatively affects lineup identifications, but the mechanisms by
which disguise works have not been explored, and different disguises have not been compared. In two
experiments (Ns _x0001_ 87 and 91) we manipulated degree of coverage by two different types of disguise: a
stocking mask or sunglasses and toque (i.e., knitted hat). Participants viewed mock-crime videos
followed by simultaneous or sequential lineups. Disguise and lineup type did not interact. In support of
the view that disguise prevents encoding, identification accuracy generally decreased with degree of
disguise. For the stocking disguise, however, full and 2/3 coverage led to approximately the same rate
of correct identifications—which suggests that disrupting encoding of specific features may be as
detrimental as disrupting a whole face. Accuracy was most affected by sunglasses and we discuss the role
metacognitions may have played. Lineup selections decreased more slowly than accuracy as coverage by
disguise increased, indicating witnesses are insensitive to the effect of encoding conditions on accuracy.
We also explored the impact of disguise and lineup type on witnesses’ confidence in their lineup
decisions, though the results were not straightforward.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of microRNA-130a (miR-130a) in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
syndrome (OSAHS)-associated pulmonary hypertension (PHT) by targeting the growth arrest-specific homeobox (GAX) gene.
Methods: A total of 108 patients with OSAHS-associated PHT were recruited as the OSAHS-associated PHT group and 110
healthy individuals were randomly selected as the normal control group. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
selected and divided into the control, miR-130a mimic, mimic negative control (NC), miR-130a inhibitor, and inhibitor-NC groups. The
dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to identify the relationship between miR-130a and the GAX gene. The quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were applied for the relative expressions of miR-130a and the
mRNA and protein expressions of GAX. Serum levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide
(NO), and super oxide dismutase (SOD) were detected. Cell apoptosis and angiogenic activity were analyzed by flow cytometry and
cell tube formation assay.
Results: GAX was a target gene of miR-130a. Compared with the normal control group, the relative expression of miR-130a and
the serum levels of ET-1 and VEGF were increased, whereas the mRNA expression of GAX and the serum levels of NO and SOD were
decreased in the OSAHS-associated PHT group. Compared with the control, mimic-NC, and inhibitor-NC groups, the relative
expressions of miR-130a in the miR-130a mimic group were enhanced, whereas the expression of miR-130a in the miR-130a
inhibitor group was reduced. However, the mRNA and protein expressions of GAX showed an opposite trend in the miR-130a mimic
and miR-130a inhibitor groups. In comparison to the control, mimic-NC, and inhibitor-NC groups, the miR-130a mimic group had an
increase of ET-1 and VEGF expressions, whereas the expressions of NO and SOD were reduced. However, the miR-130a inhibitor
group exhibited an opposite trend. The apoptosis rate and tube formation number in the miR-130a mimic group were obviously
increased, whereas the miR-130a inhibitor group showed an obvious decrease.
Conclusion: These data provided strong evidence that miR-130a may be involved in the progression of OSAHS-associated PHT
by down-regulating GAX gene.

"Abstract
There is evidence that human decision-making is affected by current body energy levels and physiological states. There is less clear evidence linking decision-making to long-term changes in energy, as those associated with obesity. We explore the link between energy, obesity and dishonesty by comparing the behaviour of obese and lean subjects when hungry or sated while playing an anonymous die-under-cup task. Participants performed the task either before or after breakfast. We find that short-term switches in energy have only a mild effect on dishonesty, as only lean females lie less when sated. By contrast, obese subjects lie more than lean subjects in both conditions, and they lie more to avoid the lowest payoff than to get the highest payoff. Our findings suggest that the observed patterns are more likely mediated by factors associated with obesity than by short term energy dynamics, and call for a better integration of the psychological, economic and biological drivers of moral behaviour.",0
"To explore the effect of microRNA-26b (miR-26b) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, we
investigated the mRNA levels of miR-26b in 4 NSCLC cell lines and 10 clinical samples from human

that miR-26b was significantly down-regulated in both NSCLC cells and human carcinoma tissues.
Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to up-regulate or down-regulate miR-26b in NSCLC cell lines
H1299 and A549 cells. Results showed that both down-regulating and up-regulating miR-26b had no
effect on cancer cell proliferation in H1299 or A549 cells, whereas miR-26b over-expression increased
cancer cell migration and reduced cisplatin chemosensitivity. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was confirmed to be directly bound by miR-26b by dual-luciferase reporter assay, and
was down-regulated in miR-26b over-expressing NSCLC cells. Finally, when PTEN was up-regulated
in NSCLC cells, it reversed the effects of miR-2b over-expression on NSCLC migration and cisplatin
chemosensitivity. In conclusion, our data showed a functional mechanism of miR-26b in regulating

"Abstract
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a serine/threonine-kinase with two doublecortin (DCX) domains. DCLK1 is associated with microtubules via DCX domains and regulates microtubule polymerization. DCLK1 is known to be expressed in cancer stem cells and provides cancer cells with tumor-initiating capacity. Accumulating clinical evidence supports that DCLK1 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and is an important prognostic marker in various human cancers. However, the mechanism, by which DCLK1 causes oncogenesis, is not yet elucidated. In this study, we showed that DCLK1 empowers human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells to form spheres under floating condition in serum-free medium, which are reminiscent of mammospheres formed by mammary epithelial stem cells. We demonstrated that DCLK1 causes chromatin instability in MCF10A cells. DCLK1 impairs DNA repairs in human colon cancer HCT116 and lung cancer H1299 cells. The kinase-negative DCLK1 mutant and the mutant that is not associated with microtubules compromise DNA repair. In conclusion, DCLK1 interferes with DNA repair and induces tumorigenesis through genomic instability and this function is independent of the kinase activity and the regulation of microtubules.",0

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of time resolved magnetic resonance angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectory (TWIST) using Gadobutrol for preoperative evaluation of lower extremity
tumors.
Materials and methods: This prospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. 50
consecutive patients (31 men, 19 women, age range 18–80 years, average age 42.7 years) with lower
extremity tumors underwent TWIST and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Image quality of
TWIST and CTA were evaluated by two radiologists according to a 4-point scale. The degree of arterial stenosis caused by tumor was assessed using TWSIT and CTA separately, and the intra-modality
agreement was determined using a kappa test. The number of feeding arteries identified by TWIST was
compared with that by CTA using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The ability to identify arterio-venous fistulae
(AVF) were compared using a chi-square test.
Results: Image quality of TWIST and CTA were rated as 3.88 ± 0.37 and 3.97 ± 0.16, without statistically
significant difference (P = 0.135). Intra-modality agreement was excellent for the assessment of arterial
stenosis (kappa = 0.806 ± 0.073 for Reader 1, kappa = 0.805 ± 0.073 for Reader 2). Readers identified AVF
with TWIST in 27 of 50 cases, and identified AVF with CTA in 14 of 50 (P < 0.001). Mean feeding arteries
identified with TWIST was significantly more than that with CTA (2.08 ± 1.72 vs 1.62 ± 1.52, P = 0.02).
Conclusion: TWIST is a reliable imaging modality for the assessment of lower extremity tumors. TWIST is
comparable to CTA for the identification of AVF and feeding arteries.

"Abstract: Endometriosis (EMS) is a common disease in women of childbearing age, and pain is the main clinical
symptom. The primary clinical treatments are surgical excision and drug therapy targeting the ectopic lesions, but
these have not been very effective. Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BTX-A) has been reported to be useful in the
treatment of pain in a variety of diseases. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic
effect and mechanism of BTX-A on EMS. We constructed a model of nerve injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells and EMS mice. Model cells and mice were treated with different concentrations of BTX-A to
observe the changes in pain behavior, to detect cell viability and the secretion of Norepinephrine (NE) and methionine enkephalin (M-EK) in cells and the spinal cord, and to evaluate the expression of apoptosis-related molecules
in spinal cord nerves. The results revealed that BTX-A significantly reduced the amount of writhing in model mice,
enhanced the activity of PC12 OGD cells, increased the secretion of NE & M-EK in model cells and the spinal cord
of mice, and decreased the apoptosis of neural cells in the spinal cord of the model mice. Therefore, we believe that
BTX-A may alleviate the pain induced by EMS by increasing the secretion of analgesic substances and promoting
the repair of nerve injury. The present study provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of pain induced by EMS.",0

Background
Dysregulation of lncRNAs is frequent in glioma and has emerged as an important mechanism involved in tumorigenesis. Previous analysis of Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database indicated that LBX2-AS1 expression is one of differentially expression lncRNA between lower grade glioma (LGG) (grade II and III) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the function and mechanism of LBX2-AS1 in glioma has not been evaluated yet.

Methods
Here, we analyzed the expression of LBX2-AS1 in GTEx data (normal brain), TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM. RT-PCR was performed to detect LBX2-AS1 in surgery obtained normal brain and glioma. CCK-8 kit and Annexin V-FITC-PI Apoptosis Detection Kit were used to study the function of LBX2-AS1 on glioma proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, western blotting and dual luciferase reporter assay were carried out to investigate the target miRNA of LBX2-AS1. The discovered mechanism was validated by the rescue assay.

Results
Following study of GTEx and TCGA data, LBX2-AS1 was significantly elevated in glioma compared with normal brain and in GBM compared with LGG. Higher expression of LBX2-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with glioma. Expression of LBX2-AS1 was positively correlated with pathology classification of glioma. Knockdown of LBX2-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in glioma. LBX2-AS1 have complimentary binding site for tumor suppressor miR-491-5p and we showed that LBX2-AS1 sponged miR-491-5p to upregulate TRIM28 expression in glioma cells. TRIM28 overexpression attenuated the effect of LBX2-AS1 knockdown on glioma cells.

Conclusions
In conclusion, LBX2-AS1 was an increased lncRNA in glioma. Mechanistically, LBX2-AS1 promoted glioma cell proliferation and resistance to cell apoptosis via sponging miR-491-5p.

We study mentorship in scientific collaborations, where a junior scientist is supported by potentially multiple senior collaborators, without them necessarily having formal supervisory roles. We identify 3 million mentor–protégé pairs and survey a random sample, verifying that their relationship involved some form of mentorship. We find that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by protégés post mentorship without their mentors. We also find that increasing the proportion of female mentors is associated not only with a reduction in post-mentorship impact of female protégés, but also a reduction in the gain of female mentors. While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia, our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career. These findings add a new perspective to the policy debate on how to best elevate the status of women in science.",0
"Abstract
Lymphocyte apoptosis is one reason for immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, although the triggers are unknown. We hypothesized that molecules in plasma, which are up-regulated during sepsis, may be responsible for this. In this study, peripheral lymphocyte apoptosis caused by extracellular histones was confirmed both in mouse and human primary lymphocytes, in which histones induced lymphocyte apoptosis dose-dependently and time-dependently. To identify which intracellular signal pathways were activated, phosphorylation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were evaluated during this process, and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was used to confirm the role of p38 in lymphocyte apoptosis induced by histones. To investigate the mitochondrial injury during these processes, we analyzed Bcl2 degradation and Rhodamine 123 to assess mitochondrial-membrane stability, via cyclosporin A as an inhibitor for mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Then, caspase 3 activation was also checked by western-blotting. We found that p38 phosphorylation, mitochondrial injury and caspase 3 activation occurred dose-dependently in histones-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis. We also observed that p38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased lymphocyte apoptotic ratio by 49% (P<0.05), and inhibition of MPT protected lymphocytes from apoptosis. Furthermore, to investigate whether histones are responsible for lymphocyte apoptosis, various concentrations of histone H4 neutralization antibodies were co-cultured with human primary lymphocytes and plasma from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice or sham mice. The results showed that H4 neutralization antibody dose-dependently blocked lymphocyte apoptosis caused by septic plasma in vitro. These data demonstrate for the first time that extracellular histones, especially H4, play a vital role in lymphocyte apoptosis during sepsis which is dependent on p38 phosphorylation and mitochondrial permeability transition. Neutralizing H4 can inhibit lymphocyte apoptosis, indicating that it could be a potential target in clinical interventions for sepsis associated immunoparalysis.",0
"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Evidence suggests that protein isoaspartate methyltransferase 1 (PCMT1) is highly expressed in brain tissue in the substantia nigra, blue plaque, and paraventricular nucleus. In this study, we investigated the effects of neural stem cell conditioned medium on the PCMT1/MST1 pathway to alleviate damage caused by amyloid β (Aβ)25-35 in SH-SY5Y cells. Results demonstrated that Aβ25-35 significantly decreased cell viability in both a time and dose-dependent manner. Neural stem cell-complete medium (NSC-CPM) or NSC-CDM had an inhibitory effect on toxicity when fibrillation of Aβ25-35 occurred, with a greater effect observed with NSC-CDM. An increase in PCMT1 expression levels was observed in the Aβ25-35 + NSC-CDM group. sh-PCMT1 significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited the protective effects of NSC-CDM through the induction of apoptosis and increased expression of p- MST1. Overexpression of PCMT1 reversed the decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induced by Aβ25-35. In summary, our findings suggest that NSC-CDM corrects the damage of Aβ25-35 to cells by increasing levels of PCMT1, which in turn reduces phosphorylation of MST.",0

Objective Recent years have seen new evidence on the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. We updated a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating dual antiplatelet versus monotherapy for patients with acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

Methods We searched PubMed and identified randomised controlled trials evaluating dual antiplatelet versus monotherapy for acute non-cardioembolic IS or TIA within 3 days of ictus up to May 2018. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI were calculated using random effects models. Clinical endpoints included stroke recurrence, composite vascular events and major bleeding.

Results 18 randomised controlled trials including 15 515 patients were pooled in the meta-analysis. When compared with monotherapy among patients with acute IS or TIA, dual antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of stroke recurrence (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.78; p<0.001) and composite vascular events (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.80; p<0.001). Dual therapy was associated with a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.87; p=0.02) when all trial data were combined. However, when all previous trials before the completion of the POINT trial were analysed, dual antiplatelet versus monotherapy was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding (RR 1.46; 95% CI 0.77 to 2.75; p=0.25).

Conclusions Among patients with acute non-cardioembolic IS or TIA within 3 days of ictus, dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a reduction in stroke recurrence, and composite vascular events, when compared with monotherapy. However, a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding was observed.",0

IMPORTANCE Accelerometers and pedometers are accessible technologies that could have a role
in encouraging physical activity (PA) in line with current recommendations. However, there is no solid
evidence of their association with PA in participants with 1 or more cardiometabolic conditions such
as diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVES To assess the association of accelerometer- and pedometer-based interventions with
increased activity and other improved health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic conditions
and to examine characteristics of the studies that could influence the association of both
interventions in improving PA.
DATA SOURCES Records from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and PsycINFO were searched from
inception until August 2018 with no language restriction.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials or cluster randomized clinical trials evaluating the use
of wearable technology devices such as pedometers and accelerometers as motivating and
monitoring tools for increasing PA were included. After removing duplicates, the searches retrieved
5762 references. Following abstract and title screening of 1439 references and full-text screening of
107 studies, 36 studies met inclusion criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Mean difference in PA was assessed by random-effects metaanalysis. Where the scale was different across studies, the standardized mean difference was used
instead. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I
2 statistic and explored using mixed-effects
metaregression. This study was registered with PROSPERO and followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was objectively measured PA in the
short to medium term (postintervention to 8 months’ follow-up).RESULTS Thirty-six randomized clinical trials (20 using accelerometers and 16 using pedometers)
involving 5208 participants were eligible for review. Meta-analysis involving 32 of these trials (4856
participants) showed medium improvements in PA: accelerometers and pedometers combined vs
comparator showed a small significant increase in PA overall (standardized mean difference, 0.39
[95% CI, 0.28-0.51]; I
2 = 60% [95% CI, 41%-73%]) in studies of short to medium follow-up over a
mean (SD) of 32 (28.6) weeks. Multivariable metaregression showed improved association with PA
for complex interventions that involved face-to-face consultation sessions with facilitators (β = 0.36;

Key Points
Question Is the use of accelerometers
and/or pedometers associated with
increased physical activity in people
with cardiometabolic conditions?
Findings This systematic review and
meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical
trials (4856 participants) found that
accelerometer- and pedometer-based
interventions were associated with
small to medium short-term
improvements in physical activity and
that consultations with health
professionals and pedometers were
associated with improved physical
activity.
Meaning Accelerometer- and
pedometer-based interventions for
people with cardiometabolic conditions
have demonstrated encouraging results,
but levels of physical activity remain
below the targets set by clinical
recommendations.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, complex accelerometer- and pedometer-based
interventions led to significant small to medium improvements in PA levels of people with
cardiometabolic conditions. However, longer-term trials are needed to assess their performance over
time. This study found no evidence that simple self-monitored interventions using either
pedometers or accelerometers are associated with improvements in PA.",0

"Abstract: To overcome texture and flavor challenges in fermented plant-based product development,
the potential of microorganisms is generating great interest in the food industry. This study examines
the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on physicochemical properties of fermented soy, oat, and coconut.
L. rhamnosus was combined with different lactic acid bacteria strains and Bifidobacterium. Acidification,
titratable acidity, and viability of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium were evaluated. Oscillation and
flow tests were performed to characterize rheological properties of fermented samples. Targeted and
untargeted volatile organic compounds in fermented samples were assessed, and sensory evaluation
with a trained panel was conducted. L. rhamnosus reduced fermentation time in soy, oat, and coconut.
L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium grew in all fermented raw materials above 107 CFU/g. No significant
effect on rheological behavior was observed when L. rhamnosus was present in fermented samples.
Acetoin levels increased and acetaldehyde content decreased in the presence of L. rhamnosus in all
three bases. Diacetyl levels increased in fermented oat and coconut samples when L. rhamnosus was
combined with a starter culture containing Streptococcus thermophilus and with another starter culture
containing S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium. In all fermented oat samples, L. rhamnosus
significantly enhanced fermented flavor notes, such as sourness, lemon, and fruity taste, which in
turn led to reduced perception of base-related attributes. In fermented coconut samples, gel firmness
perception was significantly improved with L. rhamnosus. The findings suggest that L. rhamnosus can
improve fermentation time and sensory perception of fermented plant-based products.",0
"Abstract Insects utilize diverse food resources which can affect the evolution of their genomic repertoire, including leading to gene losses in different nutrient pathways. Here, we investigate gene loss in amino acid synthesis pathways, with special attention to hymenopterans and parasitoid wasps. Using comparative genomics, we find that synthesis capability for tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and histidine was lost in holometabolous insects prior to hymenopteran divergence, while valine, leucine, and isoleucine were lost in the common ancestor of Hymenoptera. Subsequently, multiple loss events of lysine synthesis occurred independently in the Parasitoida and Aculeata. Experiments in the parasitoid Cotesia chilonis confirm that it has lost the ability to synthesize eight amino acids. Our findings provide insights into amino acid synthesis evolution, and specifically can be used to inform the design of parasitoid artificial diets for pest control.",0
"Tis study aimed to evaluate whether the augmentation of CaP into the femoral head around the lag screw results in superior
clinical and radiological outcomes of treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures using an intramedullary (IM) implant. Fify-six
consecutive patients with unstable trochanteric fractures who had been surgically treated with IM devices between 2014 and 2016
were prospectively reviewed and randomly divided into two groups based on the use of CaP degradable cements: 28 patients were
assigned to the CaP group, while the other 28 patients were assigned to the control group (no use of CaP). Clinical evaluations and
radiological analyses were conducted during a minimum of 2-year follow-up. No signifcant diferences in the mean visual analogue
scale for the hip pain scores and modifed Harris Hip Scores were found between the CaP group and the controls at postoperative 2
months and 2 years. However, earlier walker ambulation was possible in the CaP group (10 ± 9 days) compared to the control group
(13 ± 12 days) (P = 0.02). In radiological analysis, the CaP group showed signifcantly lower diference between tip-apex distance
measured immediately afer surgery and that measured at one-year follow-up compared to the control group (P = 0.012). No screw
cut-out occurred in the CaP group, while one patient in the control group was reoperated for screw cut-out. Te CaP augmentation
into the femoral head around lag screw can reduce lag screw penetration, prevent screw cut-out beyond the femoral head, and
facilitate early ambulation in elderly patients with unstable trochanteric fractures.",0

Purposes
to study the effect of titanium particles on MLO-Y4 and the effects of osteocytes alterations on osteoblasts.

Methods
cultured MLO-Y4 osteocytes were exposed to different concentrations of titanium (Ti) particles, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, Real-time PCR quantification of mRNA expression of SOST, at the same time with Western Blot detection sclerosteosis protein expression levels.MC3T3-E1 cells culture with MLO-Y4 cells exposed to different concentrations of titanium (Ti) particles in vitro, in order to detection of osteoblast osteogenetic activity.

Results
Our results showed that Ti particles inhibited cell viability of MLO-Y4 osteocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with Ti particles caused apoptosis of MLO-Y4cells.Treatment with Ti particles significantly increased expression of the osteocytic marker SOST/sclerostin. Furthermore, treatment of MLO-Y4 cells with Ti particles produced a dose-dependent decrease in ALP activity and decreased mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells through direct cell-cell contact.

Conclusions
Titanium particles damage osteocytes and inhibit osteoblast differentiation.",0

Objective The relationship between asbestos and prostate cancer (PCa) is not well understood due to small number of cases. This
study aimed to determine the incidence and mortality of PCa among workers or residents exposed to asbestos based on a
systematic review and meta-analysis
Methods All published studies citing the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) or standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of PCa in workers
or residents exposed to asbestos were collected by conducting a search on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of
Science before April 2018. Standardized mortality rate for PCa with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled using a fixed-/
random-effect model in STATA (Version14.0). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018095195.
ResultsA total of 17 independent studies were included for the analysis. The overall pooled SMR of PCa was 1.22, with a 95% CI of
1.13 to 1.32, with no heterogeneity across the studies (I2=18.8%, P=.234). Subgroup analysis shows that exposure to crocidolite,
cement, studies conducted in Europe and Oceania, and long study follow-up (≥25 years) all contribute to significantly higher SMR,
and we found no evidence of publication bias (Begg test P value=.592, Egger test P value=.874).
Conclusions This meta-analysis suggested that exposed to asbestos might be associated with an increased risk of PCa. Highexposure level of asbestos could contribute to significantly higher risk of PCa mortality.

"Abstract
Background/Aims: An increasing body of evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are involved in many different cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-dependent mechanism by which the lncRNA GAS5
contributes to the development of breast cancer. Methods: A total of 68 breast cancer patients
were enrolled, and breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues were collected. The human breast
cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, BT549, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 and human breast
cell line MCF10A were utilized in this study. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to detect expression of
relative factors. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was used to evaluate the relationship between
GAS5 and miR-23a, and a dual luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to assess the
relationship between ATG3 and miR-23a. A subcutaneous xenograft nude mouse model was
generated to examine the role of GAS5 and its regulatory pathway in autophagy. Results:
GAS5 levels were frequently decreased in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and its relatively
low expression was closely related to a larger tumour size, advanced tumour-node-metastasis
(TNM) stage and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer tissues. More importantly, we
found that GAS5 promoted autophagy, with enhanced autophagosome formation after GAS5
overexpression. GAS5 was found to act as a microRNA sponge in a pathway that included miR23a and its target gene ATG3. The GAS5-miR-23a-ATG3 axis significantly regulated autophagy
in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: In summary, we report that the GAS5-miR-23a-ATG3 axis can
be regarded as a key regulator of autophagy pathways in breast cancer; it may constitute a
promising biomarker and therapeutic target in the future.",0
"Background. Despite randomized data demonstrating better overall survival favoring radical nephrectomy, partial
nephrectomy continues to be the treatment of choice for low-stage renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: We utilized the National Cancer Database to identify patients younger than 50 years diagnosed with low-stage renal
cell carcinoma (cT1) treated with radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy (2004–2007). Inverse probability of treatment
weighting adjustment was performed for all preoperative factors to account for confounding factors. Kaplan-Meier curves
and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to compare overall survival of patients in the two treatment
arms. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the interaction of type of surgery and clinical stage on overall survival.
Results: Among the 3009 patients (median age ¼ 44 years [interquartile range (IQR) ¼ 40–47 years]), 2454 patients (81.6%) were
treated with radical nephrectomy and 555 patients (18.4%) with partial nephrectomy. The median follow-up was
108.6 months (IQR ¼ 80.2–124.3 months) during which 297 patients (12.1%) in the radical nephrectomy arm and 58 patients
(10.5%) in the partial nephrectomy arm died. Following inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment, there was no
difference in overall survival between patients treated with partial nephrectomy and radical nephrectomy (hazard ratio ¼
0.83, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.63 to 1.10, P ¼ .196). There were no statistically significant interactions between type of surgery and clinical stage on treatment outcome.
Conclusions: There was no difference in long-term overall survival between radical and partial nephrectomy in young and
healthy patients. This patient cohort may have sufficient renal reserve over their lifetime, and preserving nephrons by partial
nephrectomy may be unnecessary.",0
"Abstract
As a widespread phytoplankton species, the coccolithophore Gephyrocapsaoceanica has a significant impact on the global biogeochemical cycle through calcium carbonate precipitation and photosynthesis. As global change continues, marine phytoplankton will experience alterations in multiple parameters, including temperature, pH, CO2, and nitrogen sources, and the interactive effects of these variables should be examined to understand how marine organisms will respond to global change. Here, we show that the specific growth rate of G. oceanica is reduced by elevated CO2 (1000 μatm) in -grown cells, while it is increased by high CO2 in -grown ones. This difference was related to intracellular metabolic regulation, with decreased cellular particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content in the  and high CO2 condition compared to the low CO2 condition. In contrast, no significant difference was found between the high and low CO2 levels in  cultures (p > 0.05). The temperature increase from 20°C to 25°C increased the PON production rate, and the enhancement was more prominent in  cultures. Enhanced or inhibited particulate inorganic carbon production rate in cells supplied with  relative to  was observed, depending on the temperature and CO2 condition. These results suggest that a greater disruption of the organic carbon pump can be expected in response to the combined effects of increased / ratio, temperature, and CO2 level in the oceans of the future. Additional experiments conducted under nutrient limitation conditions are needed before we can extrapolate our findings to the global oceans.",0
"Abstract
Plants synthesize amino acids by collateral metabolic pathways using primary elements carbon and oxygen from air, hydrogen from water in soil and nitrogen from soil. Following synthesis, amino acids are immediately used for metabolism, transient storage or transported to the phloem. Different families of transporters have been identified for import of amino acids into plant cells. The first identified amino acid transporter, amino acid permease 1 (AAP1) in Arabidopsis belongs to a family of eight members and transports acidic, neutral, and basic amino acids. Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with root nodules bacteria. Following fixation, nitrogen is reduced to amino acids and is exported via different amino acid transporters. However, information is lacking about the structure of these important classes of amino acid transporter proteins in plant. We have amplified AAP from Phaseolus vulgaris, an economically important leguminous plant grown all over the world, and sequenced. The sequence has been characterized in silico and a three-dimensional structure of AAP has been predicted and validated. The information obtained not only enhances the knowledge about the structure of an amino acid permease gene in P. vulgaris, but will also help in designing protein–ligand studies using this protein as well.",0
"Abstract. Objective. An outbreak of pneumonia named COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus in
Wuhan is rapidly spreading worldwide. The objective of the present study was to clarify further the clinical characteristics and blood parameters in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods. Twenty-three
suspected patients and 64 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection were admitted to a
designated hospital. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
Results. Of the 64 patients studied, 47 (73.4%) had been exposed to a confirmed source of COVID-19
transmission. On admission, the most common symptoms were fever (75%) and cough (76.6%). Twentyeight (43.8%) COVID-19 patients showed leukopenia, 10 (15.6%) showed lymphopenia, 47 (73.4%)
and 41 (64.1%) had elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), respectively, and 30 (46.9%) had increased fibrinogen concentration. After the treatment, the
counts of white blood cells and platelets, and the level of prealbumin increased significantly, while aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hsCRP decreased. COVID-19 patients
with the hospital stay longer than 12 days had higher body mass index (BMI) and increased levels of AST,

"Introduction: CD27 is a co-stimulatory immune checkpoint molecule in the tumor necrosis
factor receptor superfamily. CD27 regulates the generation and maintenance of T cell
immunity by binding to CD70 and regulating B-cell activation and immunoglobulin
synthesis.
Materials and Methods: CD27 and CD70 expression were assessed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) compared to normal tissue samples in the GSE53625 dataset of
179 paired cases and in 153 Chinese cases using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. The correlation was also investigated between CD27 and CD70 expression and immune-related pathways, including CD8+
T cell recruitment, function, and other inhibitory immune checkpoints.
Results: Levels of both CD27 and CD70 expression were down-regulated in ESCC compared to the paired normal tissues. CD27 and CD70 expression was mainly present in
lymphocytes surrounding and infiltrating the tumor lesions but rarely expressed in tumor
cells. Lost expression of CD27 and CD70 was associated with clinicopathological features,
including depth of tumor invasion and better patient survival. Furthermore, CD27 expression
was significantly associated with levels of CD8A, GZMB, IFNG, the CD8+ T cell recruitment-associated chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and CD8 receptors (CCR5,
CXCR6, and CXCR3), while CD70 expression was inversely associated with levels of
immunosuppressive checkpoints (PD-L1, PD-L2, and HHLA2).
Conclusion: Detection of CD70/CD27 expression could be further verified as a biomarker
for ESCC early detection and prognosis prediction.

"Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) and liver cancer had similarities in imaging results, clinical
characteristics, and so on. And it is difficult for clinicians to distinguish them before operation. The aim
of our study was to build a differential diagnosis nomogram based on platelet (PLT) score model and
use internal validation to check the model. The predicting model was constructed by the retrospective
database that included in 153 patients with HAE (66 cases) or liver cancer (87 cases), and all cases
was confirmed by clinicopathology and collected from November 2011 to December 2018. Lasso
regression analysis model was used to construct data dimensionality reduction, elements selection,
and building prediction model based on the 9 PLT-based scores. A multi-factor regression analysis was
performed to construct a simplified prediction model, and we added the selected PLT-based scores
and relevant clinicopathologic features into the nomogram. Identification capability, calibration,
and clinical serviceability of the simplified model were evaluated by the Harrell’s concordance index
(C-index), calibration plot, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and decision curve. An internal
validation was also evaluated by the bootstrap resampling. The simplified model, including in 4 selected
factors, was significantly associated with differential diagnosis of HAE and liver cancer. Predictors of
the simplified diagnosis nomogram consisted of the API index, the FIB-4 index, fibro-quotent (FibroQ),
and fibrosis index constructed by King’s College Hospital (King’s score). The model presented a perfect
identification capability, with a high C-index of 0.929 (0.919 through internal validation), and good
calibration. The area under the curve (AUC) values of this simplified prediction nomogram was 0.929,
and the result of ROC indicated that this nomogram had a good predictive value. Decision curve
analysis showed that our differential diagnosis nomogram had clinically identification capability. In
conclusion, the differential diagnosis nomogram could be feasibly performed to verify the preoperative
individualized diagnosis of HAE and liver cancer.",0
"both settings since 2014 to determine whether site of service affected
stent utilization.
Methods: Between 2014 and 2018, there were 739 total angioplasty or
angioplasty with stenting procedures performed by our group; 599
were done in the hospital setting, whereas 140 were performed in an
ambulatory facility, initially as a physician office site of service and since
2018 as an ambulatory surgery center. Patients’ demographics and variables were compared.
Results: There was no difference in any clinical or demographic variable
between the hospital and nonhospital groups, other than a higher incidence of Medicaid patients in the hospital setting (P < .001). In hospital-treated patients, 190 of 599 procedures included adjunctive stenting
(33.2%), whereas in the non-hospital-treated patients, 45 of 140 had stents
(32.1%), despite financial incentives for both professional and facility reimbursement in favor of stenting (P ¼ .94).
Conclusions: Whereas financial incentives have not yet had an appreciable influence in stent utilization within previous reimbursement paradigms, the dramatic changes proposed by CMS may well alter this
dynamic and lead to substantially higher overall costs without proven
clinical advantage. With very high failure and reintervention rates and
increasingly expensive adjuncts (drug-coated balloons and stents,
covered stents), the cost implications of attempts to incentivize interventionalists toward a specific site of care are substantial, and unintended
negative consequences are likely to occur.",0

The present investigation aimed to assess the impact of copper (Cu) stress on the physiological and proteomic behavior of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. E. camaldulensis is likely a potential phytoremediator in areas vulnerable to Cu contamination, such as the industrial areas of Riyadh. To realize this objective, young seedlings of E. camaldulensis were potted in an open area with soil comprised of clay and sand. Different doses of Cu (30, 50, and 100 µM) were applied to the plants as CuSO4·5H2O for 6 weeks. Plant growth was monitored during the Cu exposure period, and morphological and physiological indicators were measured once a week to determine the growth rates. A proteomics study was also conducted to find out the influence of Cu stress on proteins. Our results showed that growth was negatively affected by Cu treatment, particularly at the highest concentrations. Moreover, using a proteomic analysis showed 26 targets involved in protein expression. Elevated levels of Cu increased the expression of 11 proteins and decreased the expression of 15 proteins. Changes were detected in proteins involved in photosynthesis, translation, transcription, metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings provided insights into the molecular mechanisms related to Cu stress, in addition to its influence on the morphological and physiological attributes of E. camaldulensis seedlings. This investigation aimed to characterize the mechanism behind the impact of Cu stress on the plant.

"Abstract
Several reviews have assessed the relationship between exposure to ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes during pregnancy, but the results remain controversial. The objective of this study was to assess this correlation quantitatively and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We included all published case-control or cohort studies that evaluated the correlation between ambient air pollution and low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), and small for gestational age (SGA). Analytical methods and inclusion criteria were provided on the PROSPERO website (CRD42018085816). We evaluated pooled effects and heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses (grouped by exposure period, study settings, study design, exposure types, data source, Newcastle-Ottawa quality score (NOS), and adjustment for smoking or meteorological factors) were also conducted and publication bias was examined. The risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in this review. Forty studies met the inclusion criteria. We observed pooled odds ratios (ORs) of 1.03–1.21 for LBW and 0.97–1.06 for PTB when mothers were exposed to CO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM2.5, PM10, or SO2 throughout their pregnancy. For SGA, the pooled estimate was 1.02 in relation to NO2 concentrations. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis decreased the heterogeneity to some extent, such as the subgroups of continuous measures (OR=0.98 (0.97–0.99), I 2=0.0%) and NOS>7 (OR=0.98 (0.97–0.99), I 2=0.0%) in evaluating the association between PTB and NO2. This review was completed with a low risk of bias. High concentrations of air pollution were significantly related to the higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, the sources of heterogeneity among studies should be further explored.",0
"Abstract
Purpose: Human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) have limited regenerative capacity in vivo. Reduced hCEC density results in bullous keratopathy requiring corneal transplantation. This study reveals the role of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in hCEC diseases and suggests that TCF4 may be a molecular target for hCEC regeneration.

Methods: Cell shape, cell proliferation rates, and proliferation-associated proteins were evaluated in normal or senescent hCECs. TCF4 was blocked by siRNA (si-TCF4) or activated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/dCas9 activation systems (pl-TCF4). The corneal endothelium of six-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was transfected by electroporation followed by cryoinjury.

Results: Cell proliferation rates and TCF4 levels were reduced in senescent cells. TCF4 CRISPR activation enhanced corneal endothelial wound healing. TCF4 regulated mitochondrial functions including mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial superoxide levels, and energy production. The percentage of cells in the S-phase was reduced with si-TCF4 and increased with pl-TCF4. Cell proliferation and cell cycle-associated proteins were regulated by TCF4. Autophagy was induced by si-TCF4. In vivo transfection of CRISPR/dCas9 activation systems (a-TCF4) induced regeneration of corneal endothelium.

Conclusions: Corneal endothelial diseases are associated with TCF4 reduction; TCF4 may be a potential target for hCEC diseases. Gene therapy using TCF4 CRISPR/dCas9 may be an effective treatment for hCEC diseases.",0

Purpose
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)–positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone. Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade. The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.
Methods
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI. Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI. Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety.
Results
Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P = .0064). Consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups. Overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall survival also favored LAP + TRAS + AI. The median PFS with LAP + AI versus TRAS + AI was 8.3 versus 5.7 months (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P = .0361). Common adverse events (AEs; ≥ 15%) with LAP + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, and LAP + AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2. Serious AEs were reported similarly across the three groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP + TRAS + AI.
Conclusion
Dual HER2 blockade with LAP + TRAS + AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS + AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC. This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",0
"ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Early childhood depression is associated with anhedonia and reduced event-related potential (ERP)
responses to rewarding or pleasant stimuli. Whether these neural measures are indicators of target engagement or
treatment outcome is not yet known.
METHODS: We measured ERP responses to win and loss feedback in a guessing task and to pleasant versus neutral
pictures in young (4.0–6.9 years of age) depressed children before and after randomization to either 18 weeks of
Parent-Child Interaction Therapy–Emotion Development (PCIT-ED) or waitlist.
RESULTS: Analyses included reward positivity (RewP) data from 118 children randomly assigned to PCIT-ED (n = 60)
or waitlist (n = 58) at baseline and late positive potential (LPP) data from 99 children (44 assigned to PCIT-ED vs. 55
assigned to waitlist) at baseline. Children undergoing PCIT-ED showed a greater reduction in anhedonia (F1,103 =
10.32, p = .002, partial h2 = .09). RewP reward responses increased more (F1,86 = 5.98, p = .02, partial h2 = .07)
for PCIT-ED, but a greater change in RewP was not significantly associated with a greater reduction in major
depressive disorder symptoms (r = 2.12, p . .4). Baseline RewP did not predict treatment change. LPPs to
positive pictures did not change across treatment, but greater baseline LPPs to positive pictures predicted a
higher likelihood of remission from major depressive disorder in children undergoing PCIT-ED (B = 0.14; SE =
0.07; odds ratio = 1.15; p = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: The ERP reward response improved in young children with depression during a treatment designed to
enhance emotion development, providing evidence of target engagement of the neural systems associated with reward.
Further, greater baseline LPP responses to positive pictures was associated with a greater likelihood of depression
remission, suggesting that this ERP measure can predict which children are most likely to respond to treatment.",0
"Abstract. Occurrence of MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene rearrangements indicates poor prognosis in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients. This is the first study to report the positive rate and distribution characteristics of MLL rearrangements in AML patients in north China. We used multiplex nested real time PCR (RT-PCR) to screen for incidence of 11 MLL
rearrangements in 433 AML patients. Eleven MLL rearrangements included (MLL-PTD, MLL-AF9, MLL-ELL, MLL-AF10,
MLL-AF17, MLL-AF6, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF1Q, MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, MLL-AFX1). There were 68 AML patients with
MLL rearrangements, and the positive rate was 15.7%. MLL-PTD (4.84%) was detected in 21 patients, MLL-AF9 in 15,
(3.46%), MLL-ELL in 10 (2.31%), MLL-AF10 in 8 (1.85%), MLL-AF1Q in 2 (0.46%), 3 cases each of MLL-AF17, MLLAF6, MLL-ENL (0.69% each), a and single case each of MLL-CBP, MLL-AF1P, and MLL-AFX1 (0.23% each). The highest
rate of MLL rearrangements was found in 24 patients with M5 subtype AML, occurring in 24 cases (35.3%). MLL rearrangements occurred in 21 patients with M2 subtype AML (30.9%), and in 10 patients with M4 subtype AML (14.7%). Screening
fusion genes by multiplex nested RT-PCR is a convenient, fast, economical, and accurate method for diagnosis and predicting
prognosis of AML.",0
"Abstract
Branching morphogenesis of developing organs requires coordinated but poorly understood changes in epithelial cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. We report that Btbd7 is a crucial regulator of branching morphogenesis in vivo. Btbd7 levels are elevated in peripheral cells of branching epithelial end buds, where it enhances cell motility and cell-cell adhesion dynamics. Genetic ablation of Btbd7 in mice disrupts branching morphogenesis of salivary gland, lung and kidney. Btbd7 knockout results in more tightly packed outer bud cells, which display stronger E-cadherin localization, reduced cell motility and decreased dynamics of transient cell separations associated with cleft formation; inner bud cells remain unaffected. Mechanistic analyses using in vitro MDCK cells to mimic outer bud cell behavior establish that Btbd7 promotes loss of E-cadherin from cell-cell adhesions with enhanced migration and transient cell separation. Btbd7 can enhance E-cadherin ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation in MDCK and peripheral bud cells for regulating cell dynamics. These studies show how a specific regulatory molecule, Btbd7, can function at a local region of developing organs to regulate dynamics of cell adhesion and motility during epithelial branching morphogenesis.",0
"Abstract
In the first paper of this series, we showed that the ratio c of individual dose to ambient dose did not change with time in Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The purpose of the present paper, the second in a series, is to estimate the lifetime doses of the Date City residents, based on continuous glass badge monitoring data, extrapolated by means of the ambient-dose-rate reduction function obtained from the airborne monitoring data. As a result, we found that the external exposure contribution to the mean additional lifetime dose of residents living in Date City is not expected to exceed 18 mSv. In addition, effects of decontamination on the reduction of individual doses were not evident. This method of combining individual doses and the ambient doses, as developed in this study, has made it possible to predict with reasonable certainty the lifetime doses of residents who continue to live in this radiologically contaminated area.",0

Abstract
Background: Dental treatments often cause pain and anxiety in patients. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel procedure that can provide distraction during dental procedures or prepare patients to receive such type of treatments. This meta-analysis is the first to gather evidence on the effectiveness of VR on the reduction of pain (P) and dental anxiety (DA) in patients undergoing dental treatment, regardless of age. Methods: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Wiley Library and Web of Science were searched for scientific articles in November 2019. The keywords used were: “virtual reality”, “distraction systems”, “dental anxiety” and “pain”. Studies where VR was used for children and adults as a measure against anxiety and pain during dental treatments were included. VR was defined as a three-dimensional environment that provides patients with a sense of immersion, transporting them to appealing and interactive settings. Anxiety and pain results were assessed during dental treatments where VR was used, and in standard care situations. Results: 31 studies were identified, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Pain levels were evaluated in four studies (n = 4), anxiety levels in three (n = 3) and anxiety and pain together in seven (n = 7). Our meta-analysis was based on ten studies (n = 10). The effect of VR was studied mainly in the pediatric population (for pain SMD = −0.82). In the adult population, only two studies (not significant) were considered. Conclusions: The findings of the meta-analysis show that VR is an effective distraction method to reduce pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a variety of dental treatments; however, further research on VR as a tool to prepare patients for dental treatment is required because of the scarcity of studies in this area.",0

Importance  Anhedonia can present in children and predict detrimental clinical outcomes.

Objective  To map anhedonia in children onto changes in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation and to probe the specificity of these changes in anhedonia against other clinical phenotypes (low mood, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]).

Design, Setting, and Participants  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were from the first annual release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, collected between September 2016 and September 2017 and analyzed between April and September 2018. Cross-sectional data of children aged 9 to 10 years from unreferred, community samples during rest (n = 2455) and during reward anticipation (n = 2566) and working memory (n = 2465) were analyzed.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Alterations in fMRI data during rest, reward anticipation, and working memory were examined, using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Functional MRI connectivity within large-scale networks, between networks, and between networks and subcortical regions were examined during rest. Functional MRI activation were examined during reward anticipation and working memory using the monetary incentive delayed and N-back tasks, respectively.

Results  Among 2455 children with adequate-quality resting-state fMRI data (mean [SD] age, 10.04 [0.62] years; 1187 girls [48.35%]), children with anhedonia (215 [8.76%]), compared with those without anhedonia (2222 [90.51%]), showed hypoconnectivity among various large-scale networks and subcortical regions, including within the arousal-related cingulo-opercular network (mean [SD] with anhedonia, 0.27 [0.08] vs without anhedonia, 0.29 [0.08]; t2,435 = 3.14; P = .002; q[false discovery rate] = 0.07; ln[Bayes factor10] = 2.32). Such hypoconnectivity did not manifest among children with low mood (241 of 2455 [9.82%]), anxiety (93 of 2455 [3.79%]), or ADHD (397 of 2455 [16.17%]), suggesting specificity. Similarly, among 2566 children (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1257 girls [48.99%]) with high-quality task-evoked fMRI data, children with anhedonia (213 of 2566 [8.3%]) demonstrated hypoactivation during reward anticipation in various areas, including the dorsal striatum and areas of the cingulo-opercular network. This hypoactivity was not found among children with low mood (240 of 2566 [9.35%]), anxiety (83 of 2566 [3.23%]), or ADHD (430 of 2566 [16.76%]). Moreover, we also found context- and phenotype-specific double dissociations; while children with anhedonia showed altered activation during reward anticipation (but not working memory), those with ADHD showed altered activation during working memory (but not reward anticipation).

Conclusions and Relevance  Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data set, phenotype-specific alterations were found in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation in children with anhedonia. The hypoconnectivity at rest and hypoactivation during reward anticipation complementarily map anhedonia onto aberrations in neural-cognitive processes: lack of intrinsic arousal connectivity during rest and diminishment of extrinsic reward-arousal activity during reward anticipation. These findings help delineate the pathophysiological underpinnings of anhedonia in children.

"Abstract
Perceptual learning serves as a mechanism for listeners to adapt to novel phonetic information. Distributional tracking theories posit that this adaptation occurs as a result of listeners accumulating talker-specific distributional information about the phonetic category in question (Kleinschmidt & Jaeger, 2015). What is not known is how listeners build these talker-specific distributions; that is, if they aggregate all information received over a certain time period, or if they rely more heavily upon the most recent information received and down-weight older, consolidated information. In the present experiment, listeners were exposed to four interleaved blocks of a lexical decision task and a phonetic categorization task in which the lexical decision blocks were designed to bias perception in opposite directions of a “s”-“sh” contrast. Listeners returned several days later and completed the identical task again. Evidence was consistent with listeners using a relatively short temporal window of integration at the individual session level. Namely, in each individual session, listener’s perception of a “s”-“sh” contrast was biased by the information in the immediately preceding lexical decision block, and there was no evidence that listeners summed their experience with the talker over the entire session. Similarly, the magnitude of the bias effect did not change between sessions, consistent with the idea that talker-specific information remains flexible, even after consolidation. In general, results suggest that listeners are maximally flexible when considering how to categorize speech from a novel talker.",0

Objective

To assess the diagnostic performance of CT fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and to assess whether its use in addition to CT coronary angiography (CTCA) changed the investigation and management of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Method

A retrospective case note review was carried out for 200 consecutive patients at Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, United Kingdom, who had CTCA sent for Heartflow CT-FFR analysis (HeartFlow, Redwood City, CA) between January 2018 and December 2019.

Results

Patients with CT-FFR > 0.8 were significantly less likely to require further investigation with coronary angiography (p: < 0.00001) than those with CT-FFR < 0.8. The use of CT-FFR significantly reduced need for further functional imaging (6% vs 26%) (p: 0.00012). A total of 15 patients in this study had both a CT-FFR and an invasive FFR measured, with seven (46.66%) of the CT-FFRs correlating with the invasive FFR. Approximately 54% of patients who had a CT-FFR < 0.8 were found to have an invasive FFR of >0.8.

Of the 56 patients who underwent coronary angiography, the CT Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) and angiography CAD-RADS were the same in 66% of the cases with 82% of CT CAD-RADS results being within ±1 of the angiography CAD-RADS.

Conclusion

The use of CT-FFR alongside CTCA led to a significant reduction in need for coronary angiography and functional testing. Further studies are required to look at the diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR in direct comparison with invasive FFR.

"ABSTRACT
The non-synovial temporomandibular jaw joint of rorqual whales is presumed to withstand intense stresses when huge volumes of water are engulfed during lunge feeding. Examination and manipulation of temporomandibular joints (TMJs) in fresh carcasses, plus CT scans and field/lab mechanical testing of excised tissue blocks, reveals that the TMJ's fibrocartilage pad fully and quickly rebounds after shrinking by 68–88% in compression (by axis) and stretching 176–230%. It is more extensible along the mediolateral axis and less extensible dorsoventrally, but mostly isotropic, with collagen and elastin fibers running in all directions. The rorqual TMJ pad compresses as gape increases. Its stiffness is hypothesized to damp acceleration, whereas its elasticity is hypothesized to absorb shock during engulfment, allow for rotation or other jaw motion during gape opening/closure, and aid in returning jaws to their closed position during filtration via elastic recoil with conversion of stored potential energy into kinetic energy.",0
"Abstract
There are conflicting results from large randomized controlled trials in different populations regarding the effectiveness of topical application of 4% chlorhexidine to the umbilical stump of newborn infants at reducing neonatal mortality. Meta-analysis and systematic review of trials performed in South Asia and Europe support 4% chlorhexidine application to reduce neonatal mortality, whereas trials performed in Sub-Saharan Africa do not. The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness of 4% chlorhexidine application to the umbilical stump of newborn infants born in lower income countries in order to reduce neonatal mortality when compared with usual cord care.

Our search strategy included randomized trials published between January1st 2000 and September 4th, 2018, that compared 4% chlorhexidine with usual cord care (“dry cord care”). The outcome variable of interest was neonatal mortality. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model were calculated. Nine trials were included, from six countries: Zambia, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Pakistan, with a total of 257,153 participants. Five studies (N = 119,833) reported neonatal mortality. There was a 21% reduction in neonatal mortality among with 4% chlorhexidine application: pooled RR (95% CI) 0.79 (0.69–0.90), P = 0.0005. The incidence of omphalitis was decreased by 35% with 4% chlorhexidine (6 studies, N = 108,263): pooled RR (95% CI) 0.65 (0.56–0.75), P = 0.00001. Chlorhexidine application delayed the umbilical cord separation time (4 studies, N = 28,917): mean difference (95% CI) 2.71 (2.63–2.78) days.

In conclusion, this systematic review found that topical application of 4% chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord stump of newborn infants in lower income countries significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal mortality. Chlorhexidine also reduces the incidence of omphalitis, but prolongs umbilical cord separation time.",0

BACKGROUND 
Serratus anterior plane blocks (SAPBs) and thoracic paravertebral blocks (TPVBs) can both be used for video-assisted thoracic surgery. However, it remains unknown whether the analgesic efficacy of a SAPB is comparable to that of a TPVB.

OBJECTIVE 
We tested the primary hypothesis that SAPBs provide noninferior analgesia compared with TPVBs for video-assisted thoracic surgery.

DESIGN 
A noninferiority randomised trial.

SETTING 
Shanghai Chest Hospital, between August 2018 and November 2018.

PATIENTS 
Ninety patients scheduled for video-assisted thoracic lobectomy or segmentectomy were randomised. Patients were excluded if they were unable to perform the visual analogue pain scale, or surgery was converted to thoracotomy.

INTERVENTIONS 
Blocks were performed after induction of general anaesthesia. The three groups were paravertebral blocks (n = 30); serratus anterior plane blocks (n = 29); and general anaesthesia alone (n = 30).

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES 
Visual analogue pain scores (0 to 10 cm) at rest and while coughing, and Prince-Henry pain scores (0 to 4 points) were used to assess postoperative analgesia at 2, 24 and 48 h after surgery. We assessed the noninferiority of SAPBs with TPVBs on all three primary pain outcomes using a delta of 1 cm or one point as appropriate.

RESULTS 
The mean difference (95% confidence intervals) in visual analogue scores between the SAPBs and TPVBs was −0.04 (−0.10 to 0.03) cm at rest, −0.22 (−0.43 to −0.01) cm during coughing and −0.10 (−0.25 to 0.05) for Prince-Henry pain scores. As the upper limit of the confidence intervals were less than 1 (all P < 0.001), noninferiority was claimed for all three primary outcomes. Compared with general anaesthesia alone, the VAS scores at rest and while coughing, and the Prince-Henry pain scores for the two blocks were significantly lower during the initial 2 h after surgery.

CONCLUSIONS 
Serratus anterior plane blocks are quicker and easier to perform than paravertebral blocks and provide comparable analgesia in patients having video-assisted thoracic surgery. Both blocks provided analgesia that was superior to general anaesthesia alone during the initial 2 h after surgery.

"Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS), which is characterized by high morbidity, disability, and mortality, is recognized as a major cerebrovascular disease. MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) was reported to participate in the progression of brain disease. The present study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of miR-31 on oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury in IS mice with the involvement of protein kinase D1 (PKD1) and the JAK/STAT3 pathway. C57BL/6J mice were used to establish the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Astrocytes were transfected with miR-31 mimic, miR-31 inhibitor, si-PKD1, or JAK-STAT3 pathway inhibitor. Following the establishment of an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model, the astrocytes were cocultured with neuronal OGD. Lower miR-31, higher PKD1 expressions, and activated JAK/STAT3 pathway were found in both the MCAO and OGD models. miR-31 could negatively target PKD1. In an MCAO model, overexpressing miR-31 and silencing PKD1 reduced neuronal injury, cerebral infarct volume, neuron loss, and oxidative stress injury, inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway and the expressions of PKD1, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, malondialdehyde, 4-HNE, 8-HOdG, caspase-3, and Bax, but increased the superoxide dismutase content. In the OGD model, overexpression of miR-31 and silencing of PKD1 attenuated oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury, and diminished the lactate dehydrogenase leakage and reactive oxygen species level, accompanied by elevated neuronal viability. These results indicate that miR-31 alleviates inflammatory response as well as an oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury in IS mice by downregulating PKD1 and JAK/STAT3 pathway.",0

Background
TREM-1 acts as an amplifier of inflammation expressed on macrophages. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TREM-1 and macrophage polarization, and association of TREM-1 and M1 macrophage polarization with insulin resistance (IR) in obese population compared to non-obese population.

Methods
We enrolled 38 patients after obtaining IRB approval for this study. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of general macrophage marker (CD68), M1 marker (CD86, CCR7, iNOS, IFNγ, TNF-α and IL-6,), M2 marker (CD206, CD163, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokine axis (MCP-1, CCR2 and CCR5) along with TREM-1 and TREM-2 in omentum fat, subcutaneous fat, and liver biopsy tissues of non-obese (N = 5), obese non-diabetics, (N = 16) and obese diabetics (N = 17).

Results
The results of our study showed over-expression of TREM-1, M1 markers and down-regulation of TREM-2 and M2 markers in the omentum, subcutaneous and liver biopsies of obese patients (diabetics and non-diabetics) compared to non-obese patients. Overall, the obese diabetic group showed a significant (p < 0.05) higher number of patients with over expression of M1 markers (TREM-1, CD68, CD86, CCR-7, iNOS, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, CCR-2 and CCR-5) and down-regulation of M2 markers (CD206, CD163 and IL-4) in liver biopsy compared to obese non-diabetics.

Conclusions
TREM-1 expression is significantly increased along with the M1 markers in liver biopsy of obese diabetic (17/17) and obese non-diabetic patients (9/16). Our data suggests that TREM-1 overexpression and M1 macrophage polarization are associated with obesity-induced IR.",0
"Looking back to our recent work that challenged the paradigm of trehalose in stress resistance in yeast,
our objective was to revisit the role of this disaccharide in chronological life span (CLS), and in the control
of apoptosis. Using a catalytically dead variant of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) protein,
(the first enzyme in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway), and by manipulating intracellular trehalose
independently of this pathway, we demonstrated that trehalose has no role in CLS or in the inhibition of
acetic acid or H202-triggered cell death.We showed instead that, in the absence of any apoptotic stimulus,
the Tps1 protein itself was necessary in preventing massive, spontaneous commitment of yeast cells to
apoptosis during growth. Without Tps1p, the life span was shortened and cells were sensitized to acetic
acid (AA) and H202, whereas the overexpression of the inactive variant of Tps1p almost abolished AAtriggered apoptosis. Genetic interaction analysis of TPS1 and genes such as YCA1, NUC1 and AIF1 indicated
thatthese key executioners of cell deathpartially relayed tps1-triggered signaling. Our results suggested
that the pro-survival role of Tps1p could be connected with its ability to preserve ATP levels in yeast cells.",0
"Abstract
Electronic devices have become ubiquitous in daily life, but they emit electromagnetic radiation, which may have negative health impacts at excessive levels. Little is known regarding the impact of radiation emissions on building occupants or strategies for reducing its intensity. This study applied a novel approach using system analysis to quantify radiation exposure in building spaces, examine building material responses to radiation propagation, and investigate risks to human health in the country of Qatar. Radiation intensity levels varied based on the location and type of building space. Different types of construction materials showed varied responses to electromagnetic field wave propagation. Drywall exhibited the best blocking effect, whereas glass and lumber walls exhibited poor blocking effects. The field strengths quantified in this study are less than the corresponding reference values specified by some jurisdictions, but they are still significantly higher than the safety levels defined in many other countries, which could result in significant health risks. The key strategies for improving indoor environmental quality include the use of shielding materials, spatial design, reduction of exposure time, increased exposure distance, and complete avoidance of exposure in sensitive areas.",0
"Abstract
Elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). An active lifestyle is necessary in order to improve lipid HDL-C, including (but not limited to) physical exercise. Research on the association between badminton, an intermittent exercise, and HDL-C is limited. We investigated the impact of aerobic exercise and badminton on HDL-C levels in Taiwanese adults. The sociodemographic data of 7797 participants comprising 3559 men and 4238 women aged between 30 to 70 years were retrieved from the Taiwan Biobank. The participants were grouped into three exercise categories—no exercise, aerobic exercise, and badminton exercise. The HDL-C levels were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The multivariate linear regression models were used to determine the associations between HDL and exercise. Comparing the other two groups to the no-exercise group, the individuals who were engaged in aerobic and badminton exercise were significantly associated with a higher HDL-C (β =1.3154; p <0.0001 and β = 6.5954; p = 0.0027, respectively). Aerobic exercise and badminton were also associated with higher HDL-C levels among carriers of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) rs328 genotypes. Aerobic exercise and regular badminton were associated with higher levels of HDL-C, with the badminton group being more significant.",0
"Abstract
Importance  For-profit (vs nonprofit) dialysis facilities have historically had lower kidney transplantation rates, but it is unknown if the pattern holds for living donor and deceased donor kidney transplantation, varies by facility ownership, or has persisted over time in a nationally representative population.

Objective  To determine the association between dialysis facility ownership and placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant.

Design, Setting, and Participants  Retrospective cohort study that included 1 585 947 patients treated at 6512 US dialysis facilities. Adult patients with incident end-stage kidney disease from the US Renal Data System (2000-2016) were linked with facility ownership (Dialysis Facility Compare) and characteristics (Dialysis Facility Report).

Exposures  The primary exposure was dialysis facility ownership, which was categorized as nonprofit small chains, nonprofit independent facilities, for-profit large chains (>1000 facilities), for-profit small chains (<1000 facilities), and for-profit independent facilities.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Access to kidney transplantation was defined as time from initiation of dialysis to placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant. Cumulative incidence differences and multivariable Cox models assessed the association between dialysis facility ownership and each outcome.

Results  Among 1 585 947 patients, the median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 54-75 years), with 55.8% male, and 28.4% non-Hispanic black patients. Eighty-eight percent of patients received care at a for-profit dialysis facility. A total of 115 650 patients (7.3%) received care at 435 nonprofit small chain facilities; 66 539 (4.2%) at 325 nonprofit independent facilities; 527 458 (33.3%) at 2239 facilities of large for-profit chain 1; 525 997 (33.2%) at 2082 facilities of large for-profit chain 2; 245 633 (15.5%) at 997 for-profit small chain facilities; and 104 670 (6.6%) at 434 for-profit independent facilities. During the study period, 230 202 patients (14.5%) were placed on the deceased donor waiting list, 39 767 (2.5%) received a living donor kidney transplant, and 88 431 (5.6%) received a deceased donor kidney transplant. For-profit facilities had lower 5-year cumulative incidence differences for each outcome vs nonprofit facilities (deceased donor waiting list: −2.6% [95% CI, −2.8% to −2.4%]; receipt of a living donor kidney transplant: −0.9% [95% CI, −1.0% to −0.8%]; and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant: −1.4% [95% CI, −1.5% to −1.3%]). Adjusted Cox analyses showed lower relative rates for each outcome among patients treated at all for-profit vs all nonprofit dialysis facilities: deceased donor waiting list (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.88]); receipt of a living donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.84]); and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.84]).

Conclusions and Relevance  Among US patients with end-stage kidney disease, receiving dialysis at for-profit facilities compared with nonprofit facilities was associated with a lower likelihood of accessing kidney transplantation. Given the possibility of residual confounding, the clinical and policy implications of the results are uncertain.",0
"Abstract
The magnetic fields of linac-MR systems modify the path of contaminant
electrons in photon beams, which alters patient entrance skin dose. Also, the
increased SSD of linac-MR systems reduces the maximum achievable dose
rate. To accurately quantify the changes in entrance skin dose, the authors
use EGSnrc Monte Carlo calculations that incorporate 3D magnetic field
of the Alberta 0.5 T longitudinal linac-MR system. The Varian 600C linac
head geometry assembled on the MRI components is used in the BEAMnrc
simulations for 6 MV and 10 MV beam models and skin doses are calculated
at an average depth of 70 μm using DOSXYZnrc. 3D modeling shows that
magnetic fringe fields decay rapidly and are small at the linac head. SSDs
between 100 and 120 cm result in skin-dose increases of between ~6%–19%
and ~1%–9% for the 6 and 10 MV beams, respectively. For 6 MV, skin dose
increases from ~10.5% to ~1.5% for field-size increases of 5 × 5 cm2
 to
20 × 20 cm2
. For 10 MV, skin dose increases by ~6% for a 5 × 5 cm2
 field,
and decreases by ~1.5% for a 20 × 20 cm2
 field. Furthermore, the proposed
reshaped flattening filter increases the dose rate from the current 355 MU min−1
to 529 MU min−1
 (6 MV) or 604 MU min−1
 (10 MV), while the skin-dose
increases by only an additional ~2.6% (all percent increases in skin dose are
relative to Dmax). This study suggests that there is minimal increase in the
entrance skin dose and minimal/no decrease in the dose rate of the Alberta

Background: 
Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) scores are required for cost-effectiveness and health-care value analysis. We evaluated HRQoL scores and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in patients with advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis treated with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty to establish values of HRQoL scores that can be used for cost-effectiveness and value analysis and to assess relationships between HRQoL scores and shoulder and upper-extremity PROMs.

Methods: 
We analyzed 143 patients (143 shoulders) with glenohumeral osteoarthritis treated with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty; 92 patients had 1-year follow-up. Preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes were assessed with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for shoulder pain and function. Health utility was assessed with the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D), and VAS Quality of Life (VAS QoL). HRQoL score validity was determined through correlations between the PROMs and HRQoL scores. The responsiveness of HRQoL scores was measured through the effect size and the standardized response mean.

Results: 
There were significant improvements in all PROMs and HRQoL scores (p < 0.001) at 1 year after the surgical procedure. The changes in VAS QoL (very weak to moderate), EQ-5D (weak), and SF-6D (weak) were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with the changes in PROMs, demonstrating comparably acceptable validity. There were large effect sizes in the VAS QoL (1.843), EQ-5D (1.186), and SF-6D (1.084) and large standardized response mean values in the VAS QoL (1.622), EQ-5D (1.230), and SF-6D (1.083), demonstrating responsiveness. The effect sizes of all PROMs were larger than those of the HRQoL scores.

Conclusions: 
PROMs and HRQoL scores are not interchangeable, and studies of the cost-effectiveness and value of shoulder arthroplasty should incorporate both shoulder and upper-extremity PROMs and HRQoL scores. The findings of this study provide data on HRQoL scores that are specific to the treatment of advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis with anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and can be used for future cost-effectiveness and value analysis studies.",0
"Purpose: To report the incidence of endophthalmitis after senile cataract surgery and to describe the
epidemiology and main risk factors.
Design: Retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional descriptive study.
Participants: Patients who underwent cataract surgery in Farabi Eye Hospital from 2006 through 2014.
Methods: All patients were evaluated retrospectively to compare risk factors, epidemiologic factors, and
prophylaxis methods related to endophthalmitis. Patient records were used to gather the data.
Main Outcome Measures: Epidemiologic factors, systemic diseases, other ocular pathologic characteristics, complications during the surgery, technique of cataract surgery, intraocular lens type, method of antibiotic
prophylaxis, surgeon experience, vitreous culture, and vision outcome were evaluated in these patients.
Results: One hundred twelve endophthalmitis cases among 480 104 operations reported, equaling an
incidence of 0.023%. Patients with diabetes mellitus (14.3%) and of older age (mean age, 81 years), perioperative
communication with the vitreous (17.9%), extracapsular cataract surgery procedure (11%), and surgery on the left
eye (58.9% vs. 41.1% for right eye; P ¼ 0.03) showed a statistically significant association with endophthalmitis.
Short-term treatment with topical or systemic preoperative antibiotics or postoperative subconjunctival injection
was associated with a 40% to 50% reduced odds of endophthalmitis compared with no prophylaxis (P ¼ 0.2). No
cases of endophthalmitis were observed among the 25 920 patients who received intracameral cefuroxime,
suggesting that this approach to antibiotic prophylaxis may be far more effective than traditional topical or
subconjunctival approaches.
Conclusions: The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in our center was 0.023%, comparable
with that of other previously published international studies. Older rural patients with immune suppressive diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, are particularly more prone to endophthalmitis. Vitreous loss at the time of
surgery was associated with a significantly increased risk. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis overall showed a 40%
to 50% reduction in risk, intracameral cefuroxime was 100% effective in preventing endophthalmitis in this
series. Ophthalmology 2016;123:295-301 ª 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",0

Objectives
Since oral betahistine has a very high first-pass effect (ca. 99%), metabolized by monoamine oxidases (MAO), the benefits of a high-dosage betahistine monotherapy were compared with those of a lower dosage of betahistine in combination with the MAO-B inhibitor (MAO-B) selegiline on the frequency of acute attacks of vertigo in patients with Menière’s disease (MD).

Methods
Thirteen adults aged 40–75 years (mean 58.9 years; six females) had initially been treated with a high dosage of betahistine dihydrochloride for at least 1 year. Under this therapy, all of them had ≤ 1 attack for ≥ 3 months prior to the combination pharmacotherapy. Subsequently, they received 5 mg/day selegiline and the dosage of betahistine was reduced to about one tenth and then individually adjusted to the dosage needed to achieve the same treatment response (≤ 1 per 3 months, observational period of at least 6 months).

Results
The initial dosage for the long-term “titration” of the attacks of vertigo was 9–80 24-mg tablets/day (mean 37.3), i.e. 216–1920 mg/day (mean 895.4 mg/day). After the combination with selegiline, the dosage needed to achieve the same benefit for ≥ 3 months was 3–36 24-mg tablets (mean 8.5), i.e., 72–864 mg/day [mean 204.9 mg/day, p < 0.001 (paired t test)]. One patient transiently stopped the treatment with selegiline, another one reduced the dosage to 2.5 mg/day and the attacks re-occurred after 2–4 weeks. Six out of 13 patients reported transient fullness of the head during the combined treatment; in 2 of them this went away when they switched to 2.5 mg bid. In the longer term (> 9 months), one patient had to increase the selegiline dosage to 5 mg bd, one patient stopped the treatment with selegiline.

Conclusions
The achievement of the same clinical effect with a significantly lower (about 1/5) dosage of betahistine can be explained by the inhibition of the MAO-B by selegiline leading to higher serum concentrations of betahistine. This approach is in line with recent developments to bypass the first-pass effect of betahistine by transbuccal or intranasal application. Despite the substantial methodological limitations of such an observational study, this combined pharmacotherapy could be an alternative to a high-dosage monotherapy with betahistine of MD.",0
"Abstract
The complexity of the climate of the past 122;000 years and recent 2000 years was investigated by analyzing the δ 18 O records of ice cores based on the sample entropy (SampEn) method and Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity. In using SampEn method, the climate complexity is measured by the sample entropy, which is a modified approximate entropy defined in terms of the occurring probability of new modes in a record. A larger sample entropy reflects a higher probability to spot a new mode in the data, and in this sense signals a larger complexity of the sample. The δ 18 O record of the past 122,000-year is found to have smaller SampEn than the recent 2000-year. This result suggests that the climate of the past 122;000-year has less complexity than that of the recent 2000 years, even though the record for the former exhibits stronger fluctuations and multifractality than the latter. This diagnosis is additionally supported by calculations of LZ complexity, which has smaller value for the record of the past 122;000 years than the recent 2000 years. Our theoretical findings may further contribute to ongoing explorations into the nonlinear statistical character of the climate change.",0
"Abstract
This double-blind, two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation on fibromyalgia. We were interested in whether rhythmic sensory stimulation would promote significant changes in fibromyalgia and associated symptoms, and whether treatment effects would differ between two distinct treatment parameters. Fifty patients with a formal diagnosis of fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to two test groups. One group received vibrotactile stimulation from a continuous sine wave single-frequency stimulation (40 Hz) for 30 minutes, five days per week, over five weeks, concomitant with usual care. The second group completed the same treatment protocol but received a different stimulation, consisting of random and intermittent complex wave gamma-range vibrotactile stimulation. Fibromyalgia symptoms, pain severity and interference, depression symptoms, quality of life and sleep quality were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results indicated that there were statistically significant changes from baseline to post-treatment in measures of fibromyalgia symptom severity, pain interference, depression, and sleep quality. However, treatment outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. These findings provide preliminary evidence that gamma-frequency rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation may decrease fibromyalgia symptoms and ease associated comorbidities, opening new avenues for further investigation of the effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on chronic pain conditions.",0
"Abstract
When relating genomic data to survival outcomes, there are three main challenges that are the censored survival outcomes, the high-dimensionality of the genomic data, and the non-normality of data. We propose a method to tackle these challenges simultaneously and obtain a robust estimation of detecting significant genes related to survival outcomes based on Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. Specifically, we include a general loss function to the AFT model, adopt model regularization and shrinkage technique, cope with parameters tuning and model selection, and develop an algorithm based on unified Expectation–Maximization approach for easy implementation. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared with existing methods when the data has heavy-tailed errors and correlated covariates. Two real case studies on patients are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method.",0
"Abstract
Background: Prenatal exposure to depression has been considered as a risk factor for adverse childhood, while it is accompanied
by unknown molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated
biological processes between cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers who exposed to major depressive disorder (MDD)
and healthy mothers.
Methods: The microarray data GSE114852 were downloaded to analyze the mRNA expression profiles of umbilical cord blood
with 31 samples exposed to prenatal MDD and 62 samples with healthy mothers. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway and Gene ontology enrichment analyses were conducted to identify associated biochemical pathways and functional
categories of the DEGs. The protein–protein interaction network was constructed and the top 10 hub genes in the network were
predicted.
Results: The results showed several immunity related processes, such as “phagosome”, “Epstein-Barr virus infection”,
“proteasome”, “positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling”, “interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway”, and
“tumor necrosis factor” presented significant differences between two groups. Most of the hub genes (for example PSMD2, PSMD6,
PSMB8, PSMB9) were also associated with immune pathways.
Conclusion: This bioinformatic analysis demonstrated immune-mediated mechanisms might play a fatal role in abnormalities in
fetal gene expression profiles caused by prenatal MDD.

"Abstract
Caffeine’s ergogenic effects persist during various exercise modalities; however, information establishing its efficacy during CrossFit protocols is limited. Our study aimed to determine the effects of caffeine supplementation on CrossFit performance. Thirteen CrossFit-trained men (age = 28.5 ± 6.6 years, experience = 49.2 ± 36.3 months) were randomized in a double-blind, crossover design. Participants completed two sessions separated by a seven-day washout period, 60 min after consuming 5 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo. In each session, participants completed as many rounds as possible in 20 min of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. CrossFit performance was the total number of repetitions completed in 20 min. Paired samples t-tests were used to compare CrossFit performance between caffeine and placebo conditions and to test for a potential learning effect between the first and second sessions. CrossFit performance was significantly higher during the caffeine condition compared to the placebo (461.4 ± 103 vs. 425.0 ± 93.5 repetitions, p < 0.05). No significant learning effect was identified between the first and second sessions (445.6 ± 95.0 vs. 440.8 ± 105.0 repetitions, p = 0.73) nor was there a significant treatment order effect (p = 0.40). Caffeine’s ergogenic effect is present during CrossFit; however, future investigations should establish caffeine’s efficacy during other CrossFit protocols and among female athletes.

"ABSTRACT
Objective: The present study utilized an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior
(TPB) to examine the psychological predictors behind the intention to drink and drive among
female Indian drivers.
Method: Three hundred and forty four female drivers (Mean age ¼ 25.9, SD ¼ 5.6, Age range ¼
18 – 35 years) completed a self-reported questionnaire about the measures related to standard
TPB variables (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention to drink and
drive) along with additional constructs such as alcohol expectancies, risk perception, fatalistic
beliefs, moral norms, past behavior and driver demographics. Pearson correlation matrix was generated to examine bivariate correlations among the various predictors. Hierarchical multiple regression model was developed to examine the influence of psychological predictors on the intention
to drink and drive.
Results: About 25% of the participants reported that they had driven under the influence of alcohol during the previous year. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that standard TPB
variables explained 67.2% of the variance in drink and drive intention. Attitude was found as the
strongest predictor followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. Furthermore,
influence of additional variables such as past behavior and moral norms on intention were found
to be significant. The overall extended TPB model accounted for 71.5% of the variability in the
intention of getting engaged in alcohol-impaired driving.
Conclusion: The study demonstrates the usefulness of TPB model which played a significant role
in predicting the intention to drink and drive along with the utility of additional significant variables. The findings of this study may be useful while designing and implementing policy interventions to reduce risks associated with drinking and driving among female drivers.",0
"Abstract
Reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells into cells resembling beta cells may provide a strategy for treating diabetes. Here we show that transient administration of epidermal growth factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor to adult mice with chronic hyperglycemia efficiently stimulates the conversion of terminally differentiated acinar cells to beta-like cells. Newly generated beta-like cells are epigenetically reprogrammed, functional and glucose-responsive, and reinstate normal glycemic control for up to 248 days. The regenerative process depends on Stat3 signaling and requires a threshold number of Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) expressing acinar cells. In contrast to previous work demonstrating in vivo conversion of acinar cells to beta-like cells by viral delivery of exogenous transcription factors, our approach achieves acinar-to-beta cell reprogramming through transient cytokine exposure rather than genetic modification.

The potential to regenerate severely damaged tissue by converting one differentiated cell type to another is common in lower vertebrates1, but in mammals this conversion capacity is rare and mainly associated with pathological metaplasia2. Thus, the discovery of signaling pathways capable of inducing therapeutic cellular plasticity could open new avenues in regenerative medicine3, 4. Insufficient functional beta cell mass, causes diabetes, a metabolic disorder with clinical complications arising from chronically elevated blood glucose levels. One potential treatment for this disease would be direct conversion of pancreatic non-beta cells into beta cells in sufficient numbers to restore and maintain normoglycemia. The capacity of other adult pancreatic cell types to give rise to new beta cells remains unclear. Genetic lineage tracing in mice demonstrated that under conditions of normal physiology or modest beta cell damage, pre-existing beta cells are solely responsible for generation of new beta cells by self-duplication 5, 6. But with extensive tissue damage by surgical duct ligation, facultative progenitor cells located near the lining of exocrine duct structures are activated to differentiate into new beta cells7. Nevertheless, a duct-related origin of these progenitor cells was contradicted by recent reports using genetic lineage tracing with different duct-specific promoters8–12. Other work showed that following toxin-induced ablation of the near-total beta cell mass alpha cells are reprogrammed to new beta cells13.

The possibility of converting acinar cells to beta cells was suggested in a study in which diabetic mice were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and gastrin14. However, this study lacked evidence by genetic lineage tracing, and subsequent genetic lineage tracing in mice did not support an acinar cell origin of beta cells in several regenerative settings in the injured adult pancreas15. In a notable advance, transduction of mouse acinar cells in vivo with vectors encoding three transcription factors that are necessary for beta cell development induced direct conversion of acinar cells to functional beta-like cells16. Further supporting the notion of lineage plasticity of acinar cells, rodent acinar cells can adopt a duct-like phenotype following suspension culture17–19, dexamethasone treatment can induce their transdifferentiation to a hepatocyte-like cell20 and addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in combination with nicotinamide, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) can stimulate their reprogramming into insulin-positive cells21–24 and own unpublished data. However, the capacity to reprogram acinar cells to beta cells in vivo without genetic manipulation has not been demonstrated.

Given that EGF in combination with either LIF or CNTF can reprogram rat acinar cells into insulin-producing beta-like cells in vitro21–23, we tested the capacity of EGF and CNTF to induce beta cell regeneration in diabetic mice. We show that this therapy regenerates a functional beta cell mass sufficient to normalize hyperglycemia and maintain normoglycemia for at least 248 days. The regenerative process involves reprogramming of acinar cells and depends on activation of the pro-endocrine regulator gene Ngn3 and signaling through STAT3. These results and this experimental model may aid future studies of the potential for using pharmacologic manipulation of signaling pathways as a therapy for diabetes.",0
"Abstract—Calcium- and cAMP-dependent activation of CREB
and transcription of cAMP-responsive element (CRE)–target
genes play critical roles in various physiological and pathological conditions. TORCs (transducers of regulated CREB)
represent a new family of conserved CREB coactivators that
function as intracellular calcium- and cAMP-sensitive coincidence detectors, controlling the kinetics of CRE-mediated
responses and long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Here we examined the expression and activity-dependent translocation of TORCs in adult retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), the primary target of acute retinal ischemic injury as
well as chronic retinal degenerative diseases. We found that
both mRNAs of TORC1 and TORC2, but not TORC3, were
enriched in adult rat retina. Comparing with TORC2, TORC1
protein was highly and selectively expressed in RGCs. At
resting condition, TORC1 protein was localized in the cytoplasm but not nucleus of RGCs. Activation of N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptors by intravitreous injection of
NMDA or increase of cAMP signaling by administration of
forskolin triggered nuclear accumulation of TORC1. Furthermore, transient retinal ischemic injury resulted in peri-nuclear and nuclear accumulation of TORC1 as well as transcription of BDNF in RGCs. Our results demonstrate that
TORC1 is enriched in RGCs and its subcellular location could
be regulated by Ca2_x0001_ and cAMP, suggesting that manipulation of TORC1 activity may promote survival of RGCs in some
optic disease conditions. © 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

Background
Human schistosomiases are acute and chronic infectious diseases of poverty. Currently, epidemiological data of urinary schistosomiasis (US) in school-age children (SAC) and adults are often reported together making it difficult to ascertain the true status of the disease. Based on this premise, we set out to carry out this review.

Method
To achieve this aim, we carried out a computer-aided search of PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, African Journals OnLine (AJOL) and the database of World Health Organization. However, the information obtained from these sources was supplemented with additional literatures from Mendeley, Research Gate, and Google.

Results
The search yielded 183 literatures of which 93 full text research, review and online articles were deemed fit for inclusion. Our key findings showed that: (1) of all World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, Africa is the most endemic zone for US, with Kenya and Senegal recording the highest prevalence and mean intensity respectively; (2) SAC within the range of 5–16 years contribute most significantly to the transmission cycle of US globally; (3) gender is a factor to watch out for, with male often recording the highest prevalence and intensity of infection; (4) contact with open, potentially infested water sources contribute significantly to transmission; (5) parental factors (occupation and education status) predispose SAC to US; (6) economic vis a vis ecological factors play a key role in infection transmission; and (7) in the last decade, a treatment coverage of 45% was never achieved globally for SAC or non-SAC treatment category for urinary schistosomiasis.

Conclusion
In view of the WHO strategic plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2020 and the findings from this review, it is obvious that this goal, in the face of realities, might not be achieved. It is imperative that annual control programmes be scaled up marginally, particularly in the African region of WHO. While US-based researches should be sponsored at the grass-root level to unveil hidden endemic foci, adequate facilities for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) should be put in place in all schools globally.

"Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with a very dismal prognosis, and current therapeutic
options still retain an overall unsatisfactorily efficacy in clinical practice. Therefore, novel therapeutic
approaches and effective medications are highly needed. Since the development of new drugs
is an extremely long, complex and expensive process, researchers and clinicians are increasingly
considering drug repositioning/repurposing as a valid alternative to the standard research process.
Drug repurposing is also under active investigation in GBM therapy, since a wide range of noncancer
and cancer therapeutics have been proposed or investigated in clinical trials. Among these, a
remarkable role is played by the antipsychotic drugs, thanks to some still partially unexplored,
interesting features of these agents. Indeed, antipsychotic drugs have been described to interfere
at variable incisiveness with most hallmarks of cancer. In this review, we analyze the effects of
antipsychotics in oncology and how these drugs can interfere with the hallmarks of cancer in GBM.
Overall, according to available evidence, mostly at the preclinical level, it is possible to speculate that
repurposing of antipsychotics in GBM therapy might contribute to providing potentially effective
and inexpensive therapies for patients with this disease.",0
"Objectives: Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. Attenuated disease severity was considered in patients with Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene variations. Corticosteroids are highly effective in controlling the symptoms but usually cause more frequent episodes. Frequent fever episodes either initiated after the steroid therapy or as an initial disease characteristics are the most challenging feature.

Methods: Sixty-seven patients were prospectively followed from September 2015 to January 2018. MEFV variants were searched in all patients. Colchicine therapy was initiated in patients with MEFV variants and with shortened intervals after the initiation of steroid therapy.

Results: Heterozygous MEFV gene variants were detected in 23 patients (34.3%). Higher exon 10 allel frequencies were found in patients with frequent fever episodes. Among 26 patients with increased episodes, colchicine treatment decreased the number of the episodes in 8 of 10 (80%) and 4 of 16 (25%) patients with and without variants, respectively (p = 0.022). Fever duration decreased (3.26 ± 1.38 vs. 1.57 ± 0.57 days, p < 0.001) at the third month of therapy in variant(+) patients.

Conclusion: In variant positive patients colchicine prophylaxis reduced the duration of attacks at the third months of therapy. Shortened intervals due to steroid therapy were increased at the sixth months of colchicine therapy.",0
"Purpose: To conduct a meta-analysis with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in full text to
demonstrate database to show the associations of perioperative, postoperative outcomes of arthroscopic
reduction and percutaneous fixation(ARPF) and open reduction and internal fixation(ORIF) for tibial
plateau fractures to provide the predictive diagnosis for clinic.
Methods: Literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for
information from the earliest date of data collection to June 2017. RCTs comparing the benefits and risks
of ARPF with those of ORIF in tibial plateau fractures were included. Statistical heterogeneity was
quantitatively evaluated by X2 test with the significance set P < 0.10 or I
2 > 50%.
Results: Seven RCTs consisting of 571 patients were included.(288 ARPF patients; 283 ORIF patients;).
Pooled results showed that ORIF was related to a greater increase in operative time, incision length,
hospital stay, perioperative complications, and full weight bearing compared with ARPF. The results
showed that ARPF was related to a greater increase in ROM Rasmussen Scores compared with ORIF
(WMD = 10.38; 95% CI, 8.31, 12.45; P < 0.10).
Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that arthroscopic reduction and percutaneous fixation for tibial
plateau fractures, compared with open reduction and internal fixation, could demonstrate an decreased
risk of perioperative and postoperative complications and improve clinical outcome in operative time,
incision length, hospital stay, perioperative complications, full weight bearing and Rasmussen Scores.",0

[cognitively normal controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD], with the lowest
testosterone levels in men with AD. Lower baseline testosterone levels were associated
with higher baseline clinical severity. Change in testosterone levels between baseline and
1-year follow-up varied by diagnosis; MCI had the greatest decreases in testosterone
levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Despite differences by clinical diagnosis,
there was no association between plasma testosterone and CSF biomarkers of AD
pathology. We also tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AR for association
with AD risk in a separate cohort from ADNI and found 26 SNPs associated with risk
for AD. The top associated SNP is predicted to be an expression quantitative trait locus
for AR in multiple tissues, including brain, with the AD-associated risk allele predicted to
confer lower AR expression. Our findings suggest a link between the androgen pathway
and AD through Aβ/tau independent pathways. These effects may be most pronounced
during conversion from MCI to dementia.",0
" Abstract
Background: The aetiology of angio-oedema (AE) is difficult to determine; however, it is essential in emergency situations when two major contexts may be present: mast cellmediated AE and bradykinin-mediated AE. Different forms
of AE are currently distinguished based on clinical criteria
(spontaneous duration of the attack, presence of concomitant or late-appearing superficial urticaria, history of atopy,
and others), but specific biomarkers could improve patient
management. Objective: In this prospective study, potential biomarkers have been identified, and their statistical
characteristics were examined. Methods: Samples were
taken on day 0 (D0) and D7 for 3 patient groups (n = 11
each): bradykinin-mediated AE [peripheral site of attack,
ear, nose, throat (ENT), and abdominal involvement], mast cell-mediated AE, and non-bradykinin-mediated abdominal pain. Results: Assay of the potential biomarkers revealed no significant differences in C1 inhibitor and C4 levels. In contrast, D-dimer levels peaked during bradykininmediated AE attacks (median 2.2 mg/l at D0 vs. 0.52 mg/l at
D7; p < 10 –3 ) as well as during mast cell-mediated AE attacks
(1.97 vs. 0.65 mg/l; p = 0.04) and were high in bradykininmediated AE compared to the control group (0.69 mg/l; p =
0.01). A threshold value of 0.62 mg/l was found to have a
negative predictive value of 100% for bradykinin-mediated
AE compared to other causes of abdominal pain (group 3).
Circulating VE-cadherin levels were also increased during
an attack (1,990 at D0 vs. 1,566 ng/ml at D7; p = 0.01), but
could not distinguish between bradykinin-mediated and
mast cell-mediated AE, like D-dimers. Conclusions: Exploration of changes in fibrinolysis-related markers (particularly
D-dimers) is thus promising for the diagnosis of AE attacks
in difficult-to-diagnose abdominal forms, although it was
not able to differentiate between bradykinin and mast cellmediated AE. ",0
"Abstract
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reverse transcriptase whose essential RNA subunit (TER) functions as a template for telomere repeat synthesis. Here we report the identification of two divergent TER moieties in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Although both TER1 and TER2 copurify with telomerase activity and serve as templates for telomerase in vitro, depletion of TER1, but not TER2, leads to decreased telomerase activity and progressive telomere shortening in vivo. Moreover, mutation of the templating domain in TER1 results in the incorporation of mutant telomere repeats on chromosome ends. Thus, TER1 provides the major template for telomerase in vivo. We also show that POT1a binds TER1 with a Kd of 2 × 10-7 M and the two components assemble into an enzymatically active RNP in vivo. In contrast, TER1-POT1b and TER2-POT1a associations were not observed. In other organisms POT1 proteins bind telomeric DNA and provide chromosome end protection. We propose that duplication of TER and POT1 in Arabidopsis fueled the evolution of novel protein–nucleic acid interactions and the migration of POT1 from the telomere to the telomerase RNP.

"Abstract
We previously showed that the small molecule 1,3,5-trihydroxy-13,13-dimethyl-2H-pyran [7,6-b] xanthone (TDP) induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by suppressing Hsp27 expression, although the mechanism is not fully understood. To investigate the functional association between TDP and Hsp27 protein in HCC, recombinant Hsp27 protein was incubated with TDP at room temperature, and assayed by mass spectrum (MS) and natural electrophoresis. TDP effectively stimulated Hsp27 to form aggregates ex vitro, leading to suppression of its chaperone activity. The aggregates were degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome (UPS) pathway. TDP directly interacted with Asp17 and Phe55 in chain C of Hsp27 on the basis of bioinformatic prediction. In conclusion, Hsp27 is a direct target of TDP in its anti-cancer activity, which provides strong support for a clinical application.",0

Background
The angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril–valsartan led to a reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The effect of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibition in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is unclear.
Methods
We randomly assigned 4822 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, ejection fraction of 45% or higher, elevated level of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease to receive sacubitril–valsartan (target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily). The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes. Primary outcome components, secondary outcomes (including NYHA class change, worsening renal function, and change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] clinical summary score [scale, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and physical limitations]), and safety were also assessed.
Results
There were 894 primary events in 526 patients in the sacubitril–valsartan group and 1009 primary events in 557 patients in the valsartan group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.01; P=0.06). The incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was 8.5% in the sacubitril–valsartan group and 8.9% in the valsartan group (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16); there were 690 and 797 total hospitalizations for heart failure, respectively (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.00). NYHA class improved in 15.0% of the patients in the sacubitril–valsartan group and in 12.6% of those in the valsartan group (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86); renal function worsened in 1.4% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.77). The mean change in the KCCQ clinical summary score at 8 months was 1.0 point (95% CI, 0.0 to 2.1) higher in the sacubitril–valsartan group. Patients in the sacubitril–valsartan group had a higher incidence of hypotension and angioedema and a lower incidence of hyperkalemia. Among 12 prespecified subgroups, there was suggestion of heterogeneity with possible benefit with sacubitril–valsartan in patients with lower ejection fraction and in women.
Conclusions
Sacubitril–valsartan did not result in a significantly lower rate of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 45% or higher.

"Abstract
The reproduced tactile sensation of haptic interfaces usually selectively reproduces a certain object attribute, such as the
object’s material reflected by vibration and its surface shape by a pneumatic nozzle array. Tactile biomechanics investigates
the relation between responses to an external load stimulus and tactile perception and guides the design of haptic interface
devices via a tactile mechanism. Focusing on the pneumatic haptic interface, we established a fluid–structure interactionbased biomechanical model of responses to static and dynamic loads and conducted numerical simulation and
experiments. This model provides a theoretical basis for designing haptic interfaces and reproducing tactile textures.",0
"Abstract
Reinforcement from engaging in health behaviors is often delayed by several months or years, a circumstance partly responsible for some people’s increased preference for engaging in unhealthy behaviors associated with immediate reinforcement. To examine whether individuals who discount the future engage in fewer health behaviors, 72 young adults completed questionnaires assessing health behaviors and impulsiveness and laboratory-behavioral measures of impulsive decision making. Regression analyses of impulsivity measures predicting health behavior were only significant for one measure, the Experiential Discounting Task, a task in which monetary consequences of choice were actually experienced by study participants. Participants who discounted most by delay (i.e., exhibited impulsive choice) engaged in fewer health behaviors than those who showed less impulsive responding. This task, in contrast to a hypothetical choice task or self-reported impulsiveness, measures the actual behavior of discounting by delay, and was the facet of impulsive decision making most closely associated with adopting a range of health behaviors.",0
"Abstract
Research has found that the appearance of women’s apparel helps increase their attractiveness as rated by men and that men care more about physical features in potential opposite-sex mates. However, the effect of sartorial appearance has received little interest from scientists. In a series of studies, the length of women’s shoe heels was examined. A woman confederate wearing black shoes with 0, 5, or 9 cm heels asked men for help in various circumstances. In Study 1, she asked men to respond to a short survey on gender equality. In Study 2, the confederate asked men and women to participate in a survey on local food habit consumption. In Study 3, men and women in the street were observed while walking in back of the female confederate who dropped a glove apparently unaware of her loss. It was found that men’s helping behavior increased as soon as heel length increased. However, heel length had no effect on women’s helping behavior. It was also found that men spontaneously approached women more quickly when they wore high-heeled shoes (Study 4). Change in gait, foot-size judgment, and misattribution of sexiness and sexual intent were used as possible explanations.",0

Objective: 
This systematic review was designed to evaluate the overall efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided implantation versus angiography-guided for percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods: 
The following electronic databases, such as CENTRAL, PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews to investigate OCT-guided and angiography-guided implantation. We measured the following 7 parameters in each patient: stent thrombosis, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), all-cause death.

Results: 
In all, 11 studies (6 RCTs and 5 observational studies) involving 4026 subjects were included, with 1903 receiving intravascular ultrasound-guided drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation and 2123 using angiography-guided DES implantation. With regard to MACE, MT, TLR, TVR, stent thrombosis and all-cause death, the group of OCT-guided implantation had no significant statistical association with remarkably improved clinical outcomes. However, its effect on cardiovascular death has a significant statistical difference in angiography-guided implantation group.

Conclusion: 
In the present pool analysis, OCT-guided DES implantation showed a tendency toward improved clinical outcomes compared to angiography-guided implantation. More eligible randomized clinical trials are warranted to verify the findings and to determine the beneficial effect of OCT-guidance for patients.",0

Background
The autistic spectrum is characterized by profound impairments of social interaction. The exact subpersonal processes, however, that underlie the observable lack of social reciprocity are still a matter of substantial controversy. Recently, it has been suggested that the autistic spectrum might be characterized by alterations of the brain’s inference about the causes of socially relevant sensory signals.
Methods
We used a novel reward-based learning task that required integration of nonsocial and social cues in conjunction with computational modeling. Thirty-six healthy subjects were selected based on their score on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and AQ scores were assessed for correlations with cue-related model parameters and task scores.
Results
Individual differences in AQ scores were significantly correlated with participants’ total task scores, with high AQ scorers performing more poorly in the task (r = −.39, 95% confidence interval = −0.68 to −0.13). Computational modeling of the behavioral data unmasked a learning deficit in high AQ scorers, namely, the failure to integrate social context to adapt one’s belief precision—the precision afforded to prior beliefs about changing states in the world—particularly in relation to the nonsocial cue.
Conclusions
More pronounced autistic traits in a group of healthy control subjects were related to lower scores associated with misintegration of the social cue. Computational modeling further demonstrated that these trait-related performance differences are not explained by an inability to process the social stimuli and their causes, but rather by the extent to which participants consider social information to infer the nonsocial cue.",0

Background
Total elbow arthroplasty is a low volume procedure. We aimed to evaluate complication rates and cumulative percentages associated with the most frequently used contemporary implants and for the commonest indications.
Methods
A systematic literature search of all studies reporting complications following total elbow arthroplasty with 12-month minimum follow-up was undertaken. Quality of studies was assessed with the Methodological-Index-for-Non-Randomised-studies criteria. British NJR data identified the most common UK prostheses and indications. The complication rates for all undesirable events contributing to patient outcome were extracted and cumulative percentages were calculated.
Results
One hundred seventeen studies were screened, 12 studies included, totalling 815 procedures. Mean follow-up was 3.8 years. The overall complication cumulative percentage was 60.7%, significantly higher than that seen in other joint arthroplasty, including a 6.5% deep infection rate. Nerve injury was comparable between implants at around 4.1%. Radiographic loosening had a cumulative rate of 17.2%. Revision for symptomatic aseptic loosening was 6.3%.
Conclusions
This is the largest systematic review of the complications of total elbow arthroplasty. Surgeons should be aware of differing complications related to their implant of choice, each having its own specific complication. Trauma as an indication appears to have an increased complication rates compared to inflammatory arthropathy. There is a lack of literature regarding the independent results of osteoarthritis as a specific indication for total elbow arthroplasty.",0
"Background. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease and a regular
epidemic in Thailand. The peak of the dengue epidemic period is around June to
August during the rainy season. It is believed that climate is an important factor for
dengue transmission.
Method. A mathematical model for vector–host infectious disease was used to
calculate the impacts of climate to the transmission of dengue virus. In this study,
the data of climate and dengue fever cases were derived from Chiang Mai during
2004–2014, Thailand. The value of seasonal reproduction number was calculated to
evaluate the potential, severity and persistence of dengue infection.
Results. The mosquito population was increasing exponentially from the start of
the rainy season in early May and reached its the peak in late June. The simulations
suggest that the greatest potential for the dengue transmission occurs when the temperature is 28.9 ◦C. The seasonal reproduction numbers were larger than one from
late March to end of August and reaching the peak in June. The highest incidences
occurred in August due to the delay of transmission humans-mosquito-humans.
Increasing mean temperature by 1 ◦C, the number of incidences increases 28.1%.
However, a very high or very low temperature reduces the number of infection.
Discussion and Conclusion. The results show that the dengue infection depends on
the seasonal variation of the climate. The rainfall provides places for the mosquitoes
to lay eggs and develop to the adult stage. The temperature plays an important role
in the life cycle and behavior of the mosquitoes. A very high or very low temperature
reduces the risk of the dengue infection.",0

Background
The outcome of chemotherapy in breast cancer is strongly influenced by multidrug resistance (MDR). Several surrogate markers of chemoresistance have been identified including - CD24 (cluster differentiation 24) expression, stem cell growth factor (SCF), B-cell lymphocyte protein 2 (Bcl-2) and annexin V. The present study aimed to examine the expression of CD24 in the sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Michigan Foudation-7) and MCF-7/adriamycin resistant (MCF-7/AdrRes) cells, and, if minimal effective doses of the anthracycline drug adriamycin (0.579 μM and 88.2 μM) would be enhanced by the antibody to SCF (anti-SCF).

Methods
CD24 expression was analysed by flow cytometry. Both Bcl-2 and annexin V protein expression were quantitatively assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Results
In MCF-7/AdrRes cells the expression of CD24 was significantly higher compared to MCF-7 cells, 86.6% and 16.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. Bcl-2 expression was significantly increased in the presence of adriamycin and SCF (p < 0.038) and decreased in the presence of adriamycin and anti-SCF. When adriamycin, anti-SCF and SCF were combined or when adriamycin was used alone the decrease in Bcl-2 expression was insignificantly altered. In the presence of both adriamycin and SCF the expression of annexin V was decreased. However, it was significantly increased in the presence of adriamycin and anti-SCF (p < 0.042), as well as adriamycin, anti-SCF and SCF combined.

In MCF-7 cells the effect of adriamycin alone or with either SCF, anti-SCF or anti-SCF or SCF combined, did not significantly alter the expression of Bcl-2. However, in the presence of both adriamycin and SCF the expression of annexin V was decreased, but was significantly increased in the presence of adriamycin and anti-SCF (p < 0.001), adriamycin, anti-SCF and SCF combined and adriamycin alone. Our results demonstrate that anti-SCF with low dose of adriamycin reduces Bcl-2 expression in MCF-7/AdrRes cells and increases annexin V expression in both MCF7/AdrRes and MCF-7 cells.

Conclusion
Adding anti-SCF to the chemotherapeutic regime of adriamycin may strongly enhance its chemotherapeutic effect in the treatment of patients with breast cancer.",0

Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a devastating pathological feature of numerous ocular diseases and is
a major cause of blindness. In this study, we examined the effect and potential mechanism of interleukin26 (IL-26) in the pathogenesis of RNV in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model. OIR model was
induced by exposure of hypoxia (75% oxygen) to C57BL/6J mice from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P12 and then
returned to room air. A significant up-regulation of IL-26 was detected in the retina at P17 after OIR, and
the expression of IL-26 was observed to be localized mainly in the retinal endothelial cells (RECs).
Furthermore, recombinant (r) IL-26 could effectively prevented RNV by reduction the areas of RNV, and
IL-26 deficiency markedly increased RNV formation. In addition, the increased expressions of nuclear
factor of activated T-cell (NFATc) 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the retina at P17 after
OIR were increased in IL-26 _x0001_/_x0001_ mice, and were down-regulated following rIL-26 treatment. Collectively,
these data suggested a possibility that IL-26 suppressed RNV via NFATc1-VEGF pathway",0
"Abstract
Rodent studies often must be conducted during an animal's active phase (that is, in darkness) yet also during a typical day shift for staff. Low-pressure sodium lighting (LPSL), to which human retinas are more sensitive than rodents’ at low intensity, has been used to facilitate study conduct in dark phase. The assumption was that LPSL would be equivalent to total darkness due to low rodent retinal sensitivity but provide enough lighting for safe technical manipulations due to higher human retinal sensitivity. Unlike other light sources, LPSL has been tested for effects on circadian rhythm specific to locomotive activities in albino mice. Whether LPSL affects circadian rhythms in rats is unknown. In this study, circadian endpoints were derived from body temperature and locomotor activity via telemeters in 8 adult male Wistar rats. When moved from a 12:12-h white-light (that is, cold white fluorescent light):dark (LD) cycle to a 12:12-h white-light:sodium-light cycle, rats demonstrated free-running and disrupted circadian rhythms (that is, lengthened circadian period and reduced circadian robustness and amplitude). Body temperature and locomotor activity were significantly lower in the LPSL phase as compared with dark phase under the baseline condition. When exposed to a 12:12 h sodium-light:dark (SD) cycle, rats entrained with a circadian period similar to 12:12-h white-light:dark (LD), but significantly different from the period under constant darkness (DD). Circadian onset and acrophase were delayed under SD compared with LD. When illuminated with a LPSL pulse under DD, rats showed phase shifts similar to white-light pulse effects, consistent with the phase response curve. To determine whether the image-forming photoreceptors are involved in this process, we used electroretinography. Compared with white light, 589-nm light generated during electroretinography elicited rod photoreceptors responses with longer latency and cone photoreceptor responses with lower amplitude. These results indicate that LPSL is a weaker zeitgeber than white light and may alter the circadian system in rats. Furthermore, because LPSL appeared to be visible to rats, it may not be an appropriate substitute for actual darkness.",0

Background. In Cameroon, both Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS/AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are used as first-line treatment against uncomplicated malaria in line with the WHO recommendations. We compared the efficacy and safety of both therapeutic combinations and determined the prevalence of drug resistance conferring mutations in three parasite genes. Methods. One hundred and fifty acute malaria patients between six months and 14 years of age were randomized to receive standard doses of either AS/AQ (73) or AL (77) and followedup for 28 days. Outcome of treatment was according to the standard WHO classification. DNA samples from pretreatment parasite isolates were used to determine the prevalence of resistant mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and dhfr genes. Results. Both drug combinations induced rapid clearance of parasites and malaria symptoms. PCR-corrected cure rates were 100% and 96.4% for AL. The combinations were well tolerated. Major haplotypes included CVIET (71%), CVMNT (25%) for the pfcrt; SND (100%) for the pfmdr1; IRN (79, 8%), NCS (8.8%), and mixed haplotype (11, 8%) for the dhfr. Conclusion. Both AS/AQ and AL were highly effective and well tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Ngaoundere, Cameroon. High prevalence of mutant pfcrt alleles confirms earlier observations. Long-term monitoring of safety and efficacy and molecular markers is highly solicited.",0

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are innovative and informative blood-based biomarkers involved in numerous pathophysiological processes. In this study and based on our previous experimental data, we investigated miR-126, miR-143, miR-145, miR-155 and miR-223 as potential circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary objective of this study was to assess the levels of miRNA expression at various stages of CKD.

Methods
RNA was extracted from serum, and RT-qPCR was performed for the five miRNAs and cel-miR-39 (internal control).

Results
Serum levels of miR-143, -145 and -223 were elevated in patients with CKD compared with healthy controls. They were further increased in chronic haemodialysis patients, but were below control levels in renal transplant recipients. In contrast, circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-155 levels, which were also elevated in CKD patients, were lower in the haemodialysis group and even lower in the transplant group. Four of the five miRNA species were correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, and three were correlated with circulating uraemic toxins.

Conclusions
This exploratory study suggests that specific miRNAs could be biomarkers for complications of CKD, justifying further studies to link changes of miRNA levels with outcomes in CKD patients.",0

Background
Pregnancy is a period of transition, which makes women more vulnerable and in unfavorable conditions may lead to psychopathology in both mother and infant. It is essential to outline factors adversely affecting the resolution of this period. Early interventions and why they matter: Interventions during pregnancy can provide important improvement in the outcome for both maternal and infant mental health.

Aim
The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk factors of antenatal anxiety and depression focusing particularly on maternal representations of the relationship towards the fetus and her own parents during pregnancy and the early postpartum period.

Methods
The study is outlined using a quantifiable interview during pregnancy to evaluate the woman’s ability to keep her child in mind, measured by reflective functioning. Reflective functioning provides information regarding the pregnant woman’s relationship quality to her fetus and important people in her life. Primiparae in Stockholm around gestation week 20 are asked about their experience with respect to pregnancy, their relationship to their family, partner, and their unborn child. The women selected to the study are an at risk population, with high levels of stress, childhood adversity, and/or history of mental health. These women are more vulnerable to develop perinatal anxiety and depression.

Results
The pregnancy interview provides valuable insight into the pregnant women’s psychic constitution. The quantifiable measure of their mental state, reflective functioning, serves as measure of quality of the mother’s parenting capacity. The countertransference and transference of the interviewer towards the women during the interview enables a more profound understanding of the underlying dynamics and constructs of repression, aggression, mourning, and narcissistic defenses.

Conclusion
A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the pregnant women’s intrapsychic reorganization of motherhood and her relation to the unborn child shall facilitate specific early interventions. These interventions shall be targeted to specific risk groups and enable the prevention of adverse child outcomes.

Objective. To compare the amounts of anchorage loss in the upper first molar (U6) and of retraction of the upper central incisor (U1) in cases with Class I malocclusion between orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) and conventional anchorage reinforcements (CARs). Methods. The subjects were 40 female adult patients with Class I malocclusion who were treated with extraction of the first premolars and sliding mechanics. The subjects were divided into Groups 1 (N = 20, CAR) and 2 (N = 20, OMI) according to anchorage method. Lateral cephalograms were taken before (T0) and after treatment (T1). Seven skeletal and dental variables and ten anchorage variables were measured. Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis. Results. Group 2 showed significantly larger retraction of U1 (U1E-sag, 9.5 mm : 7.1 mm, P < .05) and less anchorage loss of U6 (U6M-sag, 0.2 mm : 2.2 mm, P < .05; U6A-sag, 0.3 mm versus 2.4 mm, P < .01) than Group 1. There was opposite vertical movement in U1 and U6 between Groups 1 and 2 (U1E-ver, 0.9 mm intrusion : 0.7 mm extrusion; U6F-ver, 1.0 mm intrusion : 0.9 mm extrusion, P < .05). Conclusion. Although OMI could not reduce the treatment duration, it could provide better maximum anchorage of U6, greater retraction of U1, intrusion of U1 and U6 than CAR.",0
"Abstract
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of non-coding RNAs that are widely expressed in mammals. However, it is largely unknown about the function of human circRNAs and the roles of circRNAs in human oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Here we performed a comprehensive study of circRNAs in human OSCC using circRNA and mRNA microarrays, and identified many circRNAs that are differentially expressed between OSCC tissue and paired non-cancerous matched tissue. We further found a circRNA termed circRNA_100290 that served as a critical regulator in OSCC development. We discovered that circRNA_100290 was upregulated and co-expressed with CDK6 in OSCC tissue. Knockdown of circRNA_100290 decreased expression of CDK6 and inhibited proliferation of OSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Via luciferase reporter assays, circRNA_100290 was observed to directly bind to miR-29 family members. Further EGFP/RFP reporter assays showed that CDK6 was the direct target of miR-29b. Taken together, we conclude that circRNA_100290 may function as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate CDK6 expression through sponging up miR-29b family members. Taken together, it indicates that circRNAs may exert regulatory functions in OSCC and may be a potential target for OSCC therapy.",0

Background
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is caused by blood clotting in the deep veins. Thrombosis resolution and recanalization can be accelerated by endothelial progenitor cells. In this report, we investigated the effects of miR-126-loaded EPC-derived exosomes (miR-126-Exo) on EPCs function and venous thrombus resolution.

Methods
In vitro promotional effect of miR-126-Exo on the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs was investigated via transwell assay and tube formation assay. In addition, a mouse venous thrombosis model was constructed and treated with miR-126-Exo to clarify the therapeutic effect of miR-126-Exo by histological analysis. Lastly, this study predicted a target gene of miR-126 using target prediction algorithms and confirmed it by luciferase activity assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot.

Results
Transwell assay and tube formation assay indicated that miR-126-Exo could enhance the migration and tube incorporation ability of EPCs. Moreover, in vivo study manifested enhanced thrombus organization and recanalization after miR-126-Exo treatment. Meanwhile, we identified that Protocadherin 7 as a target gene of miR-126.

Conclusions
To sum up, our results demonstrated that EPC-derived exosomes loaded with miR-126 significantly promoted thrombus resolution in an animal model of venous thrombosis, indicating exosomes as a promising potential vehicle carrying therapeutic molecules for DVT therapy.",0

• The sHLA peptidomes are highly correlated with the tumor’s membranal HLA peptidomes.
• The HLA peptidomes differ significantly from the proteomes of the tumors.",0
"Abstract
Translocation of ions and other molecules across the plasma membrane of yeast requires the electric potential generated by a H+-ATPase. We measured under different conditions fluorescence changes and accumulation of acridine yellow, looking for qualitative and quantitative estimations of the PMP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in various conditions. Fluorescence changes indicated an accumulation of the dye requiring a substrate, and accumulation and quenching by mitochondria that could be released by an uncoupler. K+ produced a decrease of the fluorescence that was much lower upon the addition of Na+. These changes were confirmed by images of the cells under the microscope. The dye accumulation under different conditions showed changes consistent with the physiological situation of the cells. Since it accumulates due to the PMP, but a large part of it binds to the internal components, we permeabilized the cells with chitosan to subtract this factor and correct the accumulation data. Both raw and corrected values of PMP are different to those obtained before by other authors and our group, showing acridine yellow as a promising indicator to follow changes of the PMP by the fluorescence changes, but also by its accumulation. Under conditions described, the dye is a low cost monitor to define and follow qualitative and quantitative changes of PMP in yeast. Acridine yellow can also be used to follow changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential.",0

Bax, despite being a cytosolic protein, has the distinct ability to form channels in the
mitochondrial outer membrane capable of releasing proteins that initiate the execution phase
of apoptosis. When studied in a planar phospholipid membrane system full-length activated
Bax can form conducting entities consistent with linearly organized three-channel units
displaying steep voltage-gating (n=14) that rivals that of channels in excitable membranes. In
addition the channels display strong positive cooperativity possibly arising from the charge
distribution of the voltage sensors. Based on the functional behavior, one of the channels in
this functional triplet is oriented in the opposite direction to the others often resulting in
conflicts between the effects of the electric field and the positive cooperativity of adjacent
channels. The closure of the first channel occurs at positive potentials and this permits the
second to close but at negative potentials. The closure of the second channel in turn permits
closure of the third but at positive potentials. Positive cooperativity manifests itself in a
number of ways including the second and the third channels opening virtually
simultaneously. This extraordinary behavior must have important although as yet undefined
physiological roles.",0

Background: 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-articular methylprednisolone for reducing pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Methods: 
We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.11), PubMed (1966-2017.11), Embase (1980-2017.11), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.11), and the Cochrane Library (1900-2017.11) for randomized clinical trials comparing the use of methylprednisolone to treat knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcomes are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores and WOMAC function scores. Each outcome was combined and calculated using the statistical software STATA 12.0. Fixed/random effect model was adopted based on the heterogeneity tested by I2 statistic.

Results: 
A total of 739 patients were analyzed across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences between groups regarding the WOMAC pain scores at 4 weeks (WMD = −1.384, 95% CI: −1.975 to −0.793, P = .000), 12 weeks (WMD = −1.587, 95% CI: −2.489 to −0.685, P = .001), and 24 weeks (WMD = −1.563, 95% CI: −2.245 to −0.881, P = .000). Significant differences were identified in terms of physical function at 4 weeks (WMD = −7.925, 95% CI: −13.359 to −2.491, P = .004), 12 weeks (WMD = −7.314, 95% CI: −13.308 to −1.320, P = .117), and 24 weeks (WMD = −6.484, 95% CI: −11.256 to −1.711, P = .008).

Conclusion: 
Intra-articular methylprednisolone injection was associated with an improved pain relief and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, no severe adverse effects were observed. Due to the limited quality of the evidence currently available, higher quality RCTs were required.",0

Background
Daysy is a fertility monitor that uses the fertility awareness method by tracking and analyzing the individual menstrual cycle. In addition, Daysy can be connected to the application DaysyView to transfer stored personal data from Daysy to a smartphone or tablet (IOS, Android). This combination is interesting because as it is shown in various studies, the use of apps is increasing patients´ focus on their disease or their health behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate if by the additional use of an App and thereby improved usability of the medical device, it is possible to enhance the typical-use related as well as the method-related pregnancy rates.

Result
In the resultant group of 125 women (2076 cycles in total), 2 women indicated that they had been unintentionally pregnant during the use of the device, giving a typical-use related Pearl-Index of 1.3. Counting only the pregnancies which occurred as a result of unprotected intercourse during the infertile (green) phase, we found 1 pregnancy, giving a method-related Pearl-Index of 0.6. Calculating the pregnancy rate resulting from continuous use and unprotected intercourse exclusively on green days, gives a perfect-use Pearl-Index of 0.8.

Conclusion
It seems that combining a specific biosensor-embedded device (Daysy), which gives the method a very high repeatable accuracy, and a mobile application (DaysyView) which leads to higher user engagement, results in higher overall usability of the method.",0

Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a frequent developmental disorder characterized by pervasive deficits in social interaction, impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication, and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children.

Methods
This study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was conducted on 109 children with ASD (85 boys and 24 girls; aged 3–10 years). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the core symptoms of autism in children. ASD patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 or placebo for 4 months. The serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH)D) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. The autism severity and social maturity of the children were assessed by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). Trial registration number: UMIN-CTR Study Design: trial number: UMIN000020281.

Results
Supplementation of vitamin D was well tolerated by the ASD children. The daily doses used in the therapy group was 300 IU vitamin D3/kg/day, not to exceed 5,000 IU/day. The autism symptoms of the children improved significantly, following 4-month vitamin D3 supplementation, but not in the placebo group. This study demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of high doses of vitamin D3 in children with ASD.

Conclusions
This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients, and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies are needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD.",0
"Abstract
The surface characteristics of fractured specimens are important in hydraulic fracturing laboratory experiments. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) scanning device assembled to study these surface characteristics. Cube-shaped rock specimens were produced in the laboratory and subjected to triaxial loading until the specimen split in two in a hydraulic fracturing experiment. Each fractured specimen was placed on a rotating platform and scanned to produce 3D superficial coordinates of the surface of the fractured specimen. The scanned data were processed to produce high-precision digital images of the fractured model, a surface contour map and accurate values of the superficial area and specimen volume. The images produced by processing the 3D scanner data provided detailed information on the morphology of the fractured surface and mechanism of fracture propagation. High-precision 3D mapping of the fractured surfaces is essential for quantitative analysis of fractured specimens. The 3D scanning technology presented here is an important tool for the study of fracture characteristics in hydraulic fracturing experiments.

"Abstract
Background: Reports associate marijuana use with cardiovascular emergencies. Studies relating marijuana use to
cardiovascular mortality are scarce. Recent advance towards marijuana use legalization emphasizes the importance of
understanding relationships between marijuana use and cardiovascular deaths; the primary ranked mortality.
Recreational marijuana is primarily smoked; we hypothesize that like cigarette smoking, marijuana use will be associated
with increased cardiovascular mortalities.
Design: The design of this study was based on a mortality follow-up.
Method: We linked participants aged 20 years and above, who responded to questions on marijuana use during the
2005 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to data from the 2011 public-use linked mortality file of the
National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only participants eligible for mortality follow-up were included. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to estimate hazard ratios
for hypertension, heart disease, and cerebrovascular mortality due to marijuana use. We controlled for cigarette smoking
and other relevant variables.
Results: Of the 1213 eligible participants 72.5% were presumed to be alive. The total follow-up time was 19,569 personyears. Adjusted hazard ratios for death from hypertension among marijuana users compared to non-marijuana users was
3.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.20–9.79) and for each year of marijuana use was 1.04 (95% confidence interval:
1.00–1.07).
Conclusion: From our results, marijuana use may increase the risk for hypertension mortality. Increased duration of
marijuana use is associated with increased risk of death from hypertension. Recreational marijuana use potentially has
cardiovascular adverse effects which needs further investigation.",0

Background
Mindfulness-based therapies are being used in a wide range of common chronic conditions
in both treatment and prevention despite lack of consensus about their effectiveness in different patient categories.
Objective
To systematically review the evidence of effectiveness MBSR and MBCT in different
patient categories.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis of systematic reviews of RCTs, using the standardized MBSR or MBCT programs. We used PRISMA guidelines to assess the quality of the included reviews and performed a random effects meta-analysis with main outcome measure
Cohen’s d. All types of participants were considered.
Results
The search produced 187 reviews: 23 were included, covering 115 unique RCTs and 8,683
unique individuals with various conditions. Compared to wait list control and compared to
treatment as usual, MBSR and MBCT significantly improved depressive symptoms
(d=0.37; 95%CI 0.28 to 0.45, based on 5 reviews, N=2814), anxiety (d=0.49; 95%CI 0.37 to 0.61, based on 4 reviews, N=2525), stress (d=0.51; 95%CI 0.36 to 0.67, based on 2 reviews, N=1570), quality of life (d=0.39; 95%CI 0.08 to 0.70, based on 2 reviews, N=511)
and physical functioning (d=0.27; 95%CI 0.12 to 0.42, based on 3 reviews, N=1015). Limitations include heterogeneity within patient categories, risk of publication bias and limited
long-term follow-up in several studies.
Conclusion
The evidence supports the use of MBSR and MBCT to alleviate symptoms, both mental and
physical, in the adjunct treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, depression, anxiety disorders and in prevention in healthy adults and children.",0
"Abstract
The archaeological sites near Monte Alegre, along Brazil’s lower Amazon River, provide
new information on the little-known activities and symbolism of South American Paleoindians toward the end of the Ice Age. While paleoindian sites like Monte Verde in Chile, or
Guitarrero Cave in Peru, are located near the pacific coast, Monte Alegre lies much further
inland, 680 km upriver from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Atlantic Coast. With
excavated wood charcoal radiocarbon dated as early as 13,200 calibrated years ago, the
hill—as a source of sandstone and quartz lithics—supplied early pioneers with adequate
tools needed for colonizing the interior of the continent. Once there, they painted rock art on
the landscape, which bears a record of the sun’s horizon positions throughout the year. At
just 2˚ south of the equator, Monte Alegre shows no overt seasonal changes beyond fluctuating rainfall amounts, unlike at higher latitudes where temperature, amount of daylight,
foliage, and forms of precipitation markedly change. Near the equator, solar and stellar horizon sightings most visibly track the passage of time and seasonal cycles. However, horizons
are often hidden behind high forest canopy throughout much of the Amazon Rainforest; but
in the Monte Alegre hill ridges looming above the river, paleoindians could hike above the
canopy to peer at the horizon, more effectively synchronizing their activities to ecological
cycles. This research suggests that Monte Alegre paleoindians delimited the azimuthal
range of the sun in a solar year with notational pictographs aligned to horizon sightings at
Painel do Pilão, and leaving a painted grid of tally marks that might have served as a rudimentary early calendar. The broad-reaching implication for early Americans is that through
the strategic placement of rock art, these ancient artists fostered predictive archaeorecording from which resources could be optimally extracted, ceremonial activities could be consistently scheduled, and gatherings for social and economic exchange could be more
efficiently coordinated.",0
"Abstract
The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms and protective effect of serum‑free‑medium‑type fetal placental mesenchymal stem cell (fPMSC) culture supernatant on A549 lung epithelial cells following treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A549 lung epithelial cells were stimulated with different concentrations of H2O2, and the survival rate of the cells was examined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay. It was concluded that the H2O2 concentration when the cell survival rate was at 50% was the optimum condition to create an oxidative damage model. Hoechst 33258 staining and western blot analysis was used to validate the A549 lung epithelial cell model. Serum‑free medium was used to culture fPMSCs, and A549 lung epithelial cells treated with H2O2 were cultured with passage 3 MSC supernatant for 24 h. This was termed the supernatant group. Simultaneously, a damage group that was stimulated with H2O2 only, and a vitamin C (VC) group that was treated with H2O2 followed by 100 µmol/l VC in culture medium was also established. The apoptosis of the three groups was detected by flow cytometry, and western blotting was used to detect apoptosis‑associated and nuclear factor erythroid 2‑like 2 (Nrf2)‑kelch‑like ECH‑associated protein 1 (Keap1)‑antioxidant response element/oxidative stress‑associated protein expression. Following the CCK‑8 test, 600 µmol/l H2O2 was selected to stimulate the A549 lung epithelial cells for 24 h, which resulted in a A549 cell survival rate of 56.41±3.31%. Hoechst 33258 staining and western blotting also confirmed the reliability of the model. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the apoptotic rate of the cells in the VC and supernatant groups was reduced compared with that in the injury group. The difference between the supernatant group and the injury group was statistically significant. The detection of apoptosis‑associated proteins by western blotting revealed that the expression of apoptosis regulator BAX and Caspase‑3 in the VC and supernatant groups was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of B‑cell lymphoma‑2 was increased compared with that in the injury group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with that in the injury group, the expression of Nrf2 increased in the VC and supernatant groups, whereas the expression of Keap1 was decreased, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In conclusion, fPMSC supernatant exhibited an antioxidant capacity in A549 lung epithelial cells treated with H2O2 as a model of acute lung injury. The supernatant was found to reduce oxidative damage and inhibit apoptosis.",0
"Abstract
Importance  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is associated with a strong and severity-dependent increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Whether antireflux surgery prevents esophageal adenocarcinoma is a matter of uncertainty.

Objectives  To examine whether antireflux surgery is associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and whether the risk is different between surgically and medically treated patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants  In this multinational, population-based retrospective cohort study from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, patients undergoing surgery were followed up for a median of 12.7 years, and a comparison group of patients receiving medication only were followed up for a median of 4.8 years. All patients with a registered diagnosis of GERD (or an associated disorder), including 48 414 individuals undergoing surgery and 894 492 receiving medication only, were included in the study. The study periods varied in the different countries depending on the year of initiation of registration and the date of data retrieval, from January 1, 1964, to December 21, 2014.

Exposures  Antireflux surgery for GERD.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma over time after surgery was compared with that in a corresponding background population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% CIs and with patients with GERD who received medication using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, providing hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs adjusted for confounders.

Results  In this study of 942 906 patients with GERD, 48 414 underwent antireflux surgery (median [interquartile range] age, 66.0 [58.0-73.0] years; 27 161 male [56.1%]) and 894 492 received medication only (median [interquartile range] age, 71.0 [62.0-78.0] years; 434 035 male [48.6%]). Among patients undergoing surgery, 177 developed esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophageal adenocarcinoma risk decreased in a time-dependent manner after surgery compared with the background population (5 to <10 years after surgery: SIR, 7.63; 95% CI, 5.42-10.43; ≥15 years after surgery: SIR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.98-1.80). Among patients with more severe and objectively determined GERD, the SIRs were 10.08 (95% CI, 6.98-14.09) at 5 to less than 10 years after surgery and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.15-2.35) at 15 years or more after surgery. The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma did not change over time in surgical patients compared with patients who received medication only (5 to <10 years after surgery: HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.44-2.84; ≥15 years: HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.28-2.54). The risk remained stable over time in analyses restricted to severe reflux disease (5 to <10 years after surgery: HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.24-2.63; ≥15 years after surgery: HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.14-2.51).

Conclusions and Relevance  Medical and surgical treatment of GERD were associated with a similar reduced esophageal adenocarcinoma risk, with the risk decreasing to the same level as that in the background population over time, supporting the hypothesis that effective treatment of GERD might prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma.",0
"ABSTRACT
In situ imaging of mRNA in living cells can help to monitor the real time mRNA expression and also useful for
diagnosis and prognosis of the diseases. In this study, a new strategy was designed for simple, sensitive, and
selective platform to detect the mRNA levels by combining a hairpin probe-graphene oxide (HP1/GO) and
duplex-specific nuclease signal amplification (DSNSA). Initially, the DNA probe was adsorbed on the surface of
GO to protect it from enzymatic digestion. Then, the target mRNA (T1) was hybridized with a partial hairpin
probe which formed a duplex. Finally, under the action of DSN nuclease, the ssDNA in the DNA/RNA hybrid was
selectively cleaved and produced small fragments. Then, T1 triggered the next reaction cycle, constituting a new
circular exponential amplification. Here, we conclude that this assay is highly sensitive for the detection of target
mRNA with the lower detection limit of 1 fM under optimal conditions. Furthermore, this strategy was successfully used for imaging of mRNA in living cells.",0
"Abstract
Background: There is a global epidemic of overweight and obesity; however, this rate of
increase is even greater in some low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). South Africa
(SA) is undergoing rapid socioeconomic and demographic changes that have triggered a
rapid nutrition transition. The paper focuses on the recent rate of change of body mass
index (BMI) among children, adolescents and young adults, further stratified by key sociodemographic factors.
Methods: We analysed mean BMI of 28 247 individuals (including children) from 7301
households by age and year, from anthropometric data from four national crosssectional (repeated panel) surveys using non-linear fitted curves and associated 95%
confidence intervals.
Results: From 2008 to 2015, there was rapid rise in mean BMI in the 6–25 age band, with
the highest risk (3–4þ BMI unit increase) among children aged 8–10 years. The increase
was largely among females in urban areas and of middle-high socioeconomic standing.
Prominent gains were also observed in certain rural areas, with extensive geographical
heterogeneity across the country.
Conclusions: We have demonstrated a major deviation from the current understanding
of patterns of BMI increase, with a rate of increase substantially greater in the developing
world context compared with the global pattern. This population-wide effect will have
major consequences for national development as the epidemic of related noncommunicable disease unfolds, and will overtax the national health care budget. Our
refined understanding highlights that risks are further compounded for certain groups/

"Abstract
A growing number of studies have examined associations between night shift work and the risks of common cancers among women, with varying conclusions. We did a meta-analysis to identify whether long-term night shift work increased the risks of common cancers in women. We enrolled 61 articles involving 114,628 cases and 3,909,152 participants from Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. Risk estimates were performed with a random-effect model or a fixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses about breast cancer were conducted to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. In addition, we carried out a dose–response analysis to quantitatively estimate the accumulative effect of night shift work on the risk of breast cancer. A positive relationship was revealed between long-term night shift work and the risks of breast [OR = 1.316; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.196–1.448], digestive system (OR = 1.177; 95% CI, 1.065–1.301), and skin cancer (OR = 1.408; 95% CI, 1.024–1.934). For every 5 years of night shift work, the risk of breast cancer in women was increased by 3.3% (OR = 1.033; 95% CI, 1.012–1.056). Concerning the group of nurses, long-term night shift work presented potential carcinogenic effect in breast cancer (OR = 1.577; 95% CI, 1.235–2.014), digestive system cancer (OR = 1.350; 95% CI, 1.030–1.770), and lung cancer (OR = 1.280; 95% CI, 1.070–1.531). This systematic review confirmed the positive association between night shift work and the risks of several common cancers in women. We identified that cancer risk of women increased with accumulating years of night shift work, which might help establish and implement effective measures to protect female night shifters.

"Abstract
Loxoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the 2-arylpropionic acid type, which has used to treat musculoskeletal disorders in the horse racing industry. However, it has also used illicitly to mask clinical signs of inflammation and pain in racehorses. Thus, its accurate analysis has become an important issue in horse doping laboratories. In this study, an analytical method of loxoprofen was developed as tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivative by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Characteristic fragment ions of [M-15], [M-57], and [M-139] permitted the accurate and selective detection of loxoprofen. Under optimal conditions, this method showed good linearity (r ≥ 0.999) in the range of 10–500 ng/mL, repeatability (% relative standard deviation = 5.6–8.5), and accuracy (% relative error = − 0.3–0.9) with a detection limit of 1.0 ng. When applied to the analysis of loxoprofen in tablet and patch products, loxoprofen was positively identified as TBDMS derivative by GC–MS. The present method provided rapid and accurate determination of loxoprofen in patch and tablet products. Levels of loxoprofen were highest in equine urine at 0.5 and 1 h after oral administration with single dose (3 mg/kg) to three horses, and then rapidly reduced to below the lower limit of quantification at 24 h. Therefore, the present method will be useful for the pharmacokinetic study and doping tests for loxoprofen and other similar acidic drugs in horses.",0

Aims
The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is a pharmacotherapeutic target for drug dependence. We have successfully imaged human D3Rs using radiolabeled LS-3-134, an arylamide phenylpiperazine with moderate selectivity for the D3R over D2R and low efficacy at the D2 and D3R. In this study, we screened for effects of LS-3-134 as a potential anti-cocaine therapeutic.
Methods
Male rats were pretreated with LS-3-134 (0, 1.0, 3.2, or 5.6 mg/kg, IP) 15 min prior to tests for its effects on spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion. We next investigated the effects of LS-3-134 (0, 1.0, 3.2, 5.6, or 10.0 mg/kg, IP) on operant responding on a multiple variable-interval (VI) 60-second schedule with alternating cocaine (0.375 mg/kg, IV) and sucrose (45 mg) reinforcer components. Additionally, we tested LS-3-134 (5.6 mg/kg, IP) effects on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of cocaine reinforcement, on extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior, and on reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior by cocaine-associated light/tone cues.
Results
LS-3-134 did not alter spontaneous locomotion, but reduced cocaine-induced locomotion, break points on the high-effort progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, and responding during extinction and cue reinstatement. In contrast, LS-3-134 did not alter cocaine or sucrose reinforcement on the low-effort multiple VI 60-second schedule.
Conclusions
The effects of LS-3-134 are similar to other dopamine D3 low efficacy partial agonists and antagonists in attenuating cocaine intake under high effort schedules of reinforcement and in attenuating cocaine-seeking behavior elicited by cocaine-associated cues. These findings are consistent with the anti-craving profile of other dopamine D3 drugs.",0
"Antibodies targeting citrullinated proteins (ACPAs [anticitrullinated protein antibodies]) are commonly found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), strongly associate with distinct HLA-DR alleles, and predict a more aggressive disease course as compared with seronegative patients. Still, many features of these antibodies, including their site of production and the extent of MHC class II–driven T cell help, remain unclarified. To address these questions, we have used a single B cell–based cloning technology to isolate and express immunoglobulin (Ig) genes from joint-derived B cells of active RA patients. We found ∼25% of synovial IgG-expressing B cells to be specific for citrullinated autoantigens in the investigated ACPA+ RA patients, whereas such antibodies were not found in ACPA− patients. The citrulline-reactive monoclonal antibodies did not react with the unmodified arginine peptides, yet several reacted with more than one citrullinated antigen. A role for active antigen selection of the citrulline-reactive synovial B cells was supported by the strong bias toward amino acid replacement mutations in ACPA+ antibodies and by their loss of reactivity to citrullinated autoantigens when somatic mutations were reverted to the corresponding germline sequences.",0
"Abstract
We examined the psychological impact of visual darkness on people’s perceived risk of contagious-disease transmission.
We posited that darkness triggers an abstract construal level and increases perceived social distance from others,
rendering threats from others to seem less relevant to the self. We found that participants staying in a dimly lit
room (Studies 1 and 3–5) or wearing sunglasses (Study 2) tended to estimate a lower risk of catching contagious
diseases from others than did those staying in a brightly lit room or wearing clear glasses. The effect persisted in both
laboratory (Studies 1–4) and real-life settings (Study 5). The effect arises because visual darkness elevates perceived
social distance from the contagion (Study 3) and is attenuated among abstract (vs. concrete) thinkers (Study 4). These
findings delineate a systematic, unconscious influence of visual darkness—a subtle yet pervasive situational factor—on
perceived risk of contagion. Theoretical contributions and policy implications are discussed.",0

Background
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully implemented in cattle research and breeding. However, moving from the associations to identifying the causal variants and revealing underlying mechanisms have proven complicated. In dairy cattle populations, we face a challenge due to long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) arising from close familial relationships in the studied individuals. Long range LD makes it difficult to distinguish if one or multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) are segregating in a genomic region showing association with a phenotype. We had two objectives in this study: 1) to distinguish between multiple QTL segregating in a genomic region, and 2) use of external information to prioritize candidate genes for a QTL along with the candidate variant.

Results
We observed fixing the lead SNP as a covariate can help to distinguish additional close association signal(s). Thereafter, using the mammalian phenotype database, we successfully found candidate genes, in concordance with previous studies, demonstrating the power of this strategy. Secondly, we used variant annotation information to search for causative variants in our candidate genes. The variant information successfully identified known causal mutations and showed the potential to pinpoint the causative mutation(s) which are located in coding regions.

Conclusions
Our approach can distinguish multiple QTL segregating on the same chromosome in a single analysis without manual input. Moreover, utilizing information from the mammalian phenotype database and variant effect predictor as post-GWAS analysis could benefit in candidate genes and causative mutations finding in cattle. Our study not only identified additional candidate genes for milk traits, but also can serve as a routine method for GWAS in dairy cattle.

"Abstract
Objective. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory autoimmune disease. Vitamin D has potent immunomodulatory properties that support its use in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, including SLE. We assessed vitamin D status in patients with SLE and determined alterations in inflammatory and hemostatic markers and disease activity before and after vitamin D supplementation.

Methods. Patients with SLE (n = 267) were randomized 2:1 to receive either oral cholecalciferol 2000 IU/day or placebo for 12 months. Outcome measures included assessment of alterations in levels of proinflammatory cytokines and hemostatic markers, and improvement in disease activity before and after 12 months of supplementation. Disease activity was measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index. Vitamin D levels were measured by Liaison immunoassay (normal 30–100 ng/ml). Serum levels between 10 and 30 ng/ml were classified as vitamin D insufficiency and levels < 10 ng/ml as vitamin D deficiency.

Results. The mean 25(OH)D level at baseline was 19.8 ng/ml in patients compared to 28.7 ng/ml in controls. The overall prevalence of suboptimal and deficient 25(OH)D serum levels among patients with SLE at baseline was 69% and 39%, respectively. Lower 25(OH)D levels correlated significantly with higher SLE disease activity. At 12 months of therapy, there was a significant improvement in levels of inflammatory and hemostatic markers as well as disease activity in the treatment group compared to the placebo group.

Conclusion. Vitamin D supplementation in patients with SLE is recommended because increased vitamin D levels seem to ameliorate inflammatory and hemostatic markers and show a tendency toward subsequent clinical improvement. Clinical Trial Registry NCT01425775.",0
"Abstract—It has not been fully examined whether angiotensin II receptor blocker is superior to calcium channel blocker to
reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance. A prospective, open-labeled, randomized,
controlled trial was conducted for Japanese hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance.
A total of 1150 patients (women: 34%; mean age: 63 years; diabetes mellitus: 82%) were randomly assigned to receive
either valsartan- or amlodipine-based antihypertensive treatment. Primary outcome was a composite of acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, admission attributed to heart failure, or sudden cardiac death. Blood pressure
was 145/82 and 144/81 mmHg, and glycosylated hemoglobin was 7.0% and 6.9% at baseline in the valsartan group and
the amlodipine group, respectively. Both of them were equally controlled between the 2 groups during the study. The
median follow-up period was 3.2 years, and primary outcome had occurred in 54 patients in the valsartan group and 56 in
the amlodipine group (hazard ratio: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.66–1.40]; P=0.85). Patients in the valsartan group had a significantly
lower incidence of heart failure than in the amlodipine group (hazard ratio: 0.20 [95% CI: 0.06–0.69]; P=0.01). Other
components and all-cause mortality were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Composite cardiovascular
outcomes were comparable between the valsartan- and amlodipine-based treatments in Japanese hypertensive patients
with glucose intolerance. Admission because of heart failure was significantly less in the valsartan group. (Hypertension.

"Abstract
Building on prior work related to taste preferences of fruit lovers, we investigate the ‘‘sweet tooth’’ hypothesis. First, using CSFII
survey data, we show that fruit consumption is more highly related to sweet snack consumption than it is to salty snack consumption.
Second, a follow-up study with a different population supports the relationship by showing that sweet snack consumption is more related
to fruit consumption than it is to vegetable consumption. Knowing that people who frequently eat sweet snacks may be predisposed to
increasing their fruit consumption will enable better targeting and tailoring of educational efforts, such as those used in the 5-a-Day for

There is a paucity of large-scale studies evaluating the clinical benefit of the Gaviscon Double Action (DA) alginate-antacid formulation for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms.

Aim
Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Gaviscon DA in reducing heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia symptoms in individuals with mild-to-moderate GERD in China.

Methods
Participants with symptomatic GERD (n = 1107) were randomised to receive Gaviscon DA or placebo (two tablets four times daily) for seven consecutive days. The primary endpoint compared the change in Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) score for the GERD (heartburn + regurgitation) dimension between Gaviscon DA and placebo. Secondary endpoints compared the change in RDQ scores for individual heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia dimensions, overall treatment evaluation (OTE) scores and incidence of adverse events (AEs).

Results
Mean RDQ GERD scores: 2.51 for Gaviscon DA and 2.50 for placebo at baseline; 1.25 for Gaviscon DA and 1.46 for placebo post treatment. Gaviscon DA was statistically superior to placebo in reducing GERD and dyspepsia RDQ scores [least-squares mean (LSM) difference: GERD −0.21, P < 0.0001; dyspepsia −0.18, P = 0.0004], despite a substantial placebo response. The Gaviscon DA group reported more favourable overall treatment responses than the placebo group across all OTE categories (P < 0.0001). Superior relief of GERD symptoms was observed both in those with non-erosive and those with erosive reflux disease (LSM difference −0.14 [P = 0.038] and −0.29 [P < 0.0001] respectively). Incidence of AEs was similar in both groups.

Conclusion
Gaviscon DA tablets provide effective and safe reduction in acid reflux and dyspepsia symptoms in Chinese individuals with mild-to-moderate GERD. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01869491",0
"ABSTRACT
Background: Medically Supervised Injection Centres (MSICs) are legally-sanctioned facilities where users can
consume pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision. Although there is a substantial body of research exploring their effectiveness, there have been few attempts to quantify outcomes across studies. In order to determine the impact of the body of research as a whole, outcomes from studies were synthesised using metaanalysis.
Methods: Literature sources were identified through searches in four bibliographic databases. Inclusion in the
final review was dependent on the study meeting certain eligibility criteria, including a minimum of pre-test,
post-test, control group designs. Data were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis using both fixed and random
effects methods.
Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, MSICs had a significant, but small, positive effect on
outcomes based on the fixed effect analysis and no effect based on random effect analysis. The results of the
independent outcome analyses showed that MSICs had a significant favourable result in relation to drug-related
crime and a significant unfavourable result in relation to problematic heroin use or injection. MSICs were found
to have no effect on overdose mortality or syringe/equipment sharing.
Conclusion: Whilst the effectiveness of the early versions of MSICs remains uncertain, this should not rule out
continuing to test and develop MSICs in locations where public injecting and other drug-related harms are a
major problem. It is important, however, that evaluation research publishes replicable data to enable future
meta-analyses and to expand the body of knowledge in the field.",0

Background
Thrombotic diseases are a group of prevalent and life-threatening diseases. Selective inhibition of pathological thrombosis holds the key to treat variety of thrombotic diseases. The pathological thrombosis can be induced by either tissue necrosis and deregulated inflammation. HMGB1, as an important proinflammatory cytokine and a late mediator, also involves on thrombosis disease. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

Methods
Immunofluorescence, ELISA assay, Platelet Aggregation, Thromboelastogram (TEG) analyzes. Flow cytometric analysis and Western blot analysis were used to investigated the role of HMGB1 in platelet aggregation and obtained following observations.

Results
By doing so, we obtained the following observations: i) Highly purified HMGB1 recombinant protein induces platelet aggregation and secretion in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of serum. ii) Low concentration of extracellular HMGB1 could synergistically promote subthreshold concentration of collagen or thrombin induced platelet aggregation. iii) Extracellular HMGB1 promoted platelet aggregation in a platelet-expressed GPIIb/IIIa-dependent manner. iv) We proposed that extracellular HMGB1 seems to promote the phosphorylation of GPIIb/IIIa and subsequent platelet aggregation via TLR4/NF-κB and cGMP pathway.

Conclusions
In this study, we provide evidence for the hypothesis that HMGB1 interact with platelet might play an important role in the haemostasis and thrombotic diseases. Our research might be provide an interesting avenue for the treatment of thrombotic diseases in the future.",0

Background
We investigated the mechanism of action of silymarin in a mouse model of renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (I/R) to ascertain its role in the treatment of I/R injury.

Methods
Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were divided randomly into three groups: control (sham); ischemia–reperfusion (I/R); silymarin + ischemia–reperfusion (silymarin + I/R). In sham mice, an abdominal incision was made, followed by dissection of the bilateral renal pedicle, with no further cross-clamping of arteries. Silymarin + I/R mice were administered 100 mg/kg silymarin daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery, whereas I/R mice were administered (i.g.) 0.9 % saline + 0.1 % (v/v) ethanol daily for 7 consecutive days before surgery. Silymarin + I/R and I/R mice were subjected to renal ischemia to induce acute kidney injury after 45-min clamping of bilateral renal arteries. Serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were measured. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining was undertaken to detect damaged renal tissue. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunofluorescent detection of CD68 expression was undertaken for each group. Levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted by renal tissue were monitored by ELISA. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Expression of cleaved-caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by western blotting.

Results
Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were elevated in silymarin + I/R and I/R groups compared with sham mice (p < 0.05), whereas those in the I/R group were significantly higher than in the silymarin + I/R group (p < 0.05). Number of damaged renal tubule cells and apoptotic cells in sham and silymarin + I/R groups was significantly lower than in I/R mice. MPO activity and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in silymarin + I/R and I/R groups was reduced (p < 0.05), and CD68 expression in silymarin + I/R mice was lower than in I/R mice (p < 0.05). Expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax in the I/R group was significantly higher than in sham mice, whereas Bcl-2 expression was lower than in silymarin + I/R mice (p < 0.05).

Conclusions
Silymarin can inhibit renal I/R injury by inhibiting release of inflammatory factors and regulating apoptosis.

"Abstract
Due to controversial evidence in the literature pertaining to the activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in platelets, we examined the effects of residual platelets present in plasma (a potential pre-analytical variable) on various plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-related assays. Blood samples were collected from 151 individuals and centrifuged at 352 and 1500 g to obtain plasma with varying numbers of platelet. In a follow-up study, blood samples were collected from an additional 23 individuals, from whom platelet-poor (2000 g), platelet-containing (352 g) and platelet-rich plasma (200 g) were prepared and analysed as fresh-frozen and after five defrost-refreeze cycles (to determine the contribution of in vitro platelet degradation). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen, tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, plasma clot lysis time, β-thromboglobulin and plasma platelet count were analysed. Platelet α-granule release (plasma β-thromboglobulin) showed a significant association with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels but weak associations with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and a functional marker of fibrinolysis, clot lysis time. Upon dividing the study population into quartiles based on β-thromboglobulin levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen increased significantly across the quartiles while plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and clot lysis time tended to increase in the 4th quartile only. In the follow-up study, plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen was also significantly influenced by platelet count in a concentration-dependent manner. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels increased further after complete platelet degradation. Residual platelets in plasma significantly influence plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen levels mainly through release of latent plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with limited effects on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex or plasma clot lysis time. Platelets may however also have functional effects on plasma fibrinolytic potential in the presence of high platelet counts, such as in platelet-rich plasma.",0

Introduction: The number of women postponing childbirth until an advanced age is
increasing. Our aim was to study the outcome of labor in nulliparous women
≥40 years, compared with women 2529 years, after both spontaneous onset and
induction of labor.
Material and methods: The nationwide populationbased Swedish Medical Birth
Register was used to study the perinatal outcome in nulliparous women with a singleton, term (gestational weeks 3744), live fetus in cephalic presentation and a planned
vaginal delivery from 1992 to 2011. We included 7796 nulliparous women ≥40 years
and 264 262 nulliparous women 2529 years. Prevalence and risk of intrapartum cesarean section, operative vaginal delivery, obstetric anal sphincter injury and a 5minute Apgar score <7 were calculated for women ≥40 years stratified for spontaneous
onset and induction of labor, using women 2529 years as the reference in both
strata. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results: Overall, 79% of women ≥40 years with a trial of labor reached a vaginal delivery. After spontaneous onset, intrapartum cesarean section was performed in
15.4% of women ≥40 years compared with 5.4% of women 2529 years (aOR 3.07,
95% CI 2.813.35). Operative vaginal delivery was performed in 22.3% of women
≥40 years compared with 14.2% of women 2529 years (aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.591.85).
After induction of labor, an intrapartum cesarean section was performed in 37.2%
women ≥40 years compared with 20.2% women 2529 years (aOR 2.51, 95% CI
2.242.81). Operative vaginal delivery was performed in 22.6% of women ≥40 years
compared with 18.4% women 2529 years (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.281.65). The risk of
obstetric anal sphincter injury or a 5minute Apgar score <7 was not increased in
women ≥40 years, regardless of onset of labor.
Conclusions: Trial of labor ended in vaginal delivery in 79% of nulliparous women
≥40 years. The risks of intrapartum cesarean section and operative vaginal delivery
were higher in women ≥40 years compared with women 2529 years, after both
spontaneous onset and induction of labor. The risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury

"Background and Aim. The aim of study was to evaluate safety, feasibility, and procedural variables of transradial approach compared with transfemoral approach in a standard population of patients undergoing coronary catheterization as one of the major criticisms of the transradial approach is that it takes longer overall procedure and fluoroscopy time, thereby causing more radiation exposure. Method. Between January 2015 and December 2015, a total of 1,997 patients in LPS Institute of Cardiology, GSVM Medical College, Kanpur, UP, India, undergoing coronary catheterization were randomly assigned to the transradial or transfemoral approach. Result. Successful catheterization was achieved in 1045 of 1076 patients (97.1%) in the transradial group and in 918 of 921 patients (99.7%) in the transfemoral group (p = 0.001). Comparing the transradial and transfemoral approaches, fluoroscopy time (2.46 ± 1.22 versus 2.83 ± 1.31 min; p = 0.32), procedure time (8.89 ± 2.72 versus 9.33 ± 2.82 min; p = 0.56), contrast volume (67.52 ± 22.54 versus 71.63 ± 25.41 mL; p = 0.32), radiation dose as dose area product (24.2 ± 4.21 versus 22.3 ± 3.46 Gycm2; p = 0.43), and postprocedural rise of serum creatinine (6 ± 4.5% versus 8 ± 2.6%; p = 0.41) were not significantly different while vascular access site complications were significantly lower in transradial group than transfemoral group (3.9% versus 7.6%; p = 0.04). Conclusion. The present study shows that transradial access for coronary angiography is safe among patients compared to transfemoral access with lower rate of local vascular complications.",0
"Abstract
The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.",0
"Abstract
NaCT is a Na+-coupled transporter for citrate expressed in hepatocytes and neurons. It is the mammalian ortholog of INDY (I’m Not Dead Yet), a transporter which modifies lifespan in Drosophila. Here we describe a hitherto unknown transport system for citrate in mammalian cells. When liver and mammary epithelial cells were pretreated with the iron supplement ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), uptake of citrate increased >10-fold. Iron chelators abrogated the stimulation of citrate uptake in FAC-treated cells. The iron exporter ferroportin had no role in this process. The stimulation of citrate uptake also occurred when Fe3+ was added during uptake without pretreatment. Similarly, uptake of Fe3+ was enhanced by citrate. The Fe3+-citrate uptake was coupled to Na+. This transport system was detectable in primary hepatocytes and neuronal cell lines. The functional features of this citrate transport system distinguish it from NaCT. Loss-of-function mutations in NaCT cause early-onset epilepsy and encephalopathy; the newly discovered Na+-coupled Fe3+-citrate transport system might offer a novel treatment strategy for these patients to deliver citrate into affected neurons independent of NaCT. It also has implications to iron-overload conditions where circulating free iron increases, which would stimulate cellular uptake of citrate and consequently affect multiple metabolic pathways.",0

antimicrobial activity against E. coli (IC50 = 2.10 µg/mL) and minimum activity against
S. aureus (IC50 = 43.63 µg/mL). Five antibiotics [trimethoprim (18 µg/g), fluconazole
(6 µg/g), ketoconazole (18 µg/g), nalidixic acid (135 µg/g), and rifampicin (56 µg/g)]

also detected in strain DST103 which may possibly be responsible for the production
of antimicrobial compounds. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

"Abstract
Numerous genetic alterations associated with cancer progression have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cancer. Numerous studies have suggested that claudin proteins, which are the primary components of tight junction structures, are associated with the regulation of cell polarity and cell differentiation. To investigate the expression profiles of the tight junction proteins claudin‑2, ‑5, ‑7 and ‑8 in gastric carcinoma, immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect the expression profiles of these claudin proteins in gastric carcinoma tissues and in homologous non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues. According to the present study, the expression levels of claudin‑7 and claudin‑8 were downregulated, while the expression of claudin‑5 was upregulated in gastric carcinoma tissues compared with in non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues. Additionally, no notable difference was observed between claudin‑2 expression in gastric carcinoma tissues and non‑neoplastic mucosae. Correlations between claudin‑7 and ‑8 expression and lymphatic metastasis in gastric carcinoma tissues were additionally reported. In summary, the present study revealed the distinct expression profiles of claudin‑5, ‑7 and ‑8 in non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues and gastric carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, the expression of these claudin proteins was highly associated with metastatic progression and prognosis in patients with gastric carcinoma, and had predictive value for the metastasis and survival of patients with gastric carcinoma.",0

Background
Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.
Methods
In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). On the basis of the results of an interim analysis, the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4.8 years.
Results
A total of 7447 persons were enrolled (age range, 55 to 80 years); 57% were women. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses. A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.92) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (96 events) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (83 events), respectively, versus the control group (109 events). No diet-related adverse effects were reported.
Conclusions
Among persons at high cardiovascular risk, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events. (Funded by the Spanish government's Instituto de Salud Carlos III and others; Controlled-Trials.com number, ISRCTN35739639.)",0
"Background
Decompressive laminectomy (DI) is a standard operation for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patient with severe claudication symptoms for many years. However, patients whose symptom severity does not meet undergoing invasive surgery make therapeutic options into dilemma. Interspinous spacers (ISP) bridge the gap between surgical interventions and CC in management of LSS. In our study, we aim to systematically assess the two FDA-approved interspinous spacers for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: Superion versus X-STOP.

Methods
Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library were searched to retrieve clinical trials concerning the comparison between Superion and X-STOP in treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis before April 2017. The following outcome measures were extracted: (1) Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) patient satisfaction score, (2) axial pain severity, (3) extremity pain severity, (4) back-specific functional impairment, (5) reoperation, and (6) complication. The data analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3.

Results
Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1118 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analysis indicated that the Superion group is superior to X-STOP in axial pain severity (SMD: 0.03; 95% CI 0.15, 0.45; p < 0.0001, I2 = 41%, p = 0.16), ZCQ patient satisfaction score (SMD: 0.23; 95% CI 0.08, 0.38; p = 0.002, I2 = 0%, p = 0.61). However, Superion group showed similarity outcome in extremity pain severity (SMD: 0.18; 95% CI − 0.06, 0.43; p = 0.14, I2 = 62%, p = 0.05), back-specific functional impairment (SMD: 0.04; 95% CI − 0.10, 0.19; p = 0.56, I2 = 0%, p = 0.77), reoperation rate (RR: 1.10; 95% CI 0.82, 1.48; p = 0.51, I2 = 19%, p = 0.30), and complication (RR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.63, 1.53; p = 0.92, I2 = 0%, p = 0.83).

Conclusion
Both the Superion and X-STOP interspinous spacers can relieve symptoms of LSS. In addition, the Superion spacer may represent a promising spacer for patient with LSS. As we know, the effectiveness and safety of ISP is still considered investigational and unfavor clinical results in the medical literature may continue to limit the appeal of IPS to many surgeons in the future. However, because of the advantage of IPS technique, it will win a wide place in the future degenerative lumbar microsurgery.

"Background
Diabetes and high body-mass index (BMI) are associated with increased risk of several cancers, and are increasing in prevalence in most countries. We estimated the cancer incidence attributable to diabetes and high BMI as individual risk factors and in combination, by country and sex.
Methods
We estimated population attributable fractions for 12 cancers by age and sex for 175 countries in 2012. We defined high BMI as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. We used comprehensive prevalence estimates of diabetes and BMI categories in 2002, assuming a 10-year lag between exposure to diabetes or high BMI and incidence of cancer, combined with relative risks from published estimates, to quantify contribution of diabetes and high BMI to site-specific cancers, individually and combined as independent risk factors and in a conservative scenario in which we assumed full overlap of risk of diabetes and high BMI. We then used GLOBOCAN cancer incidence data to estimate the number of cancer cases attributable to the two risk factors. We also estimated the number of cancer cases in 2012 that were attributable to increases in the prevalence of diabetes and high BMI from 1980 to 2002. All analyses were done at individual country level and grouped by region for reporting.
Findings
We estimated that 5·6% of all incident cancers in 2012 were attributable to the combined effects of diabetes and high BMI as independent risk factors, corresponding to 792 600 new cases. 187 600 (24·5%) of 766 000 cases of liver cancer and 121 700 (38·4%) of 317 000 cases of endometrial cancer were attributable to these risk factors. In the conservative scenario, about 4·5% (626 900 new cases) of all incident cancers assessed were attributable to diabetes and high BMI combined. Individually, high BMI (544 300 cases) was responsible for twice as many cancer cases as diabetes (280 100 cases). 26·1% of diabetes-related cancers (equating to 77 000 new cases) and 31·9% of high BMI-related cancers (174 040 new cases) were attributable to increases in the prevalence of these risk factors from 1980 to 2002.
Interpretation
A substantial number of cancer cases are attributable to diabetes and high BMI. As the prevalence of these cancer risk factors increases, clinical and public health efforts should focus on identifying optimal preventive and screening measures for whole populations and individual patients.

"ABSTRACT
The performance characteristics of the ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) Etest (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), MIC test strips (MTS; Liofilchem, Italy), and disk diffusion (Hardy, Santa Ana, CA) were evaluated for a collection of 308 beta-lactam-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered from three institutions in Los Angeles, CA. Reference testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution (rBMD) method. MIC and disk results were interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. Overall, 72.5% of the isolates were susceptible to C-T by rBMD. Etest and disk diffusion demonstrated acceptable performance, whereas MTS yielded a greater than acceptable percentage of minor errors. Categorical agreement was 96.8% for Etest, 87.0% for MTS, and 92.9% for disk diffusion. No very major errors were observed by any test, and no major errors (ME) were observed by Etest or disk diffusion. Two ME (0.9% of susceptible isolates) were observed by MTS. The incidence of minor errors was 3.2%, 12.3%, and 7.1% for Etest, MTS, and disk diffusion, respectively. Essential agreement (EA) for Etest was excellent, at 97.7%, whereas the MICs obtained by MTS tended to be 1 to 2 dilutions higher than those obtained by rBMD, with an EA of 87.0%.",0

Purpose
Studies on the association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and breast cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We quantitatively assessed this association by conducting a meta-analysis based on the evidence from observational studies.

Methods
We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published up to and including December 31, 2013. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for cancer risk.

Results
A total of 17 studies (9 cohort studies, 8 case-control studies) were selected for further study. These studies included 149,607 female subjects, of which 53,812 were CCBs users, who were followed for 2–16 years. The risks of breast cancer among patients receiving CCBs were significantly different for the pooled RRs (95% confidence interval) of cohort studies 1.08 (0.95, 1.20) and case-control studies 0.98 (0.86, 1.09). Differences were also noted for cancer risk, for CCBs use of <5 years 0.96 (0.78, 1.15), and for >5 years 1.01 (0.74, 1.28), as well as for ever used 1.08 (0.95, 1.20), and for current use 1.13 (0.83, 1.42). The RR for studies longer than 10 years was 1.71 (1.01, 2.42), and for studies evaluating nifedipine was 1.10 (0.87, 1.33) and diltiazem was 0.75 (0.40, 1.10).

Conclusions
The long-term use of CCBs appears to have a significant relationship with breast cancer. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to optimize the doses and types of these drugs needed to minimize their carcinogenic potential.",0

Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technologies have resulted in the accumulation of large data sets in the public domain, facilitating comparative studies to provide novel insights into the evolution of life. Phylogenetic studies across the eukaryotic taxa have been reported but on the basis of a limited number of genes. Here we present a genome-wide analysis across different plant, fungal, protist, and animal species, with reference to the 36,002 expressed genes of the rice genome. Our analysis revealed 9831 genes unique to rice and 98 genes conserved across all 49 eukaryotic species analysed. The 98 genes conserved across diverse eukaryotes mostly exhibited binding and catalytic activities and shared common sequence motifs; and hence appeared to have a common origin. The 98 conserved genes belonged to 22 functional gene families including 26S protease, actin, ADP–ribosylation factor, ATP synthase, casein kinase, DEAD-box protein, DnaK, elongation factor 2, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phosphatase 2A, ras-related protein, Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family protein, tubulin, ubiquitin and others. The consensus Bayesian eukaryotic tree of life developed in this study demonstrated widely separated clades of plants, fungi, and animals. Musa acuminata provided an evolutionary link between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, and Salpingoeca rosetta provided an evolutionary link between fungi and animals, which indicating that protozoan species are close relatives of fungi and animals. The divergence times for 1176 species pairs were estimated accurately by integrating fossil information with synonymous substitution rates in the comprehensive set of 98 genes. The present study provides valuable insight into the evolution of eukaryotes.",0
"Abstract
KIF3A/B, a kinesin involved in intraflagellar transport and Golgi trafficking, is distinctive because it contains two nonidentical motor domains. Our hypothesis is that the two heads have distinct functional properties, which are tuned to maximize the performance of the wild-type heterodimer. To test this, we investigated the motility of wild-type KIF3A/B heterodimer and chimaeric KIF3A/A and KIF3B/B homodimers made by splicing the head of one subunit to the rod and tail of the other. The first result is that KIF3A/B is processive, consistent with its transport function in cells. Secondly, the KIF3B/B homodimer moves at twice the speed of the wild-type motor but has reduced processivity, suggesting a trade-off between speed and processivity. Third, the KIF3A/A homodimer moves fivefold slower than wild-type, demonstrating distinct functional differences between the two heads. The heterodimer speed cannot be accounted for by a sequential head model in which the two heads alternate along the microtubule with identical speeds as in the homodimers. Instead, the data are consistent with a coordinated head model in which detachment of the slow KIF3A head from the microtubule is accelerated roughly threefold by the KIF3B head.

"Abstract
Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is associated with pancreatic and colorectal cancer, among others. To-date, there are no FDA-approved small molecule Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors and many past efforts resulted in compounds with undesirable off-target effects. We recently identified a series of benzimidazole analogs as potent inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Here, we show that the lead compound SRI36160 displayed selective Wnt inhibition and potent antiproliferative activity in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, SRI36160 had no effect on STAT3 and mTORC1 signaling in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, and was not effective in inhibiting proliferation of non-cancerous cells. Our findings suggest that this series of benzimidazole analogs presents a novel approach for the treatment of Wnt-dependent cancers such as colorectal and pancreatic cancer.

"The use of the iron chelator deferiprone (L1, CP20, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one) for the treatment
of diseases of iron overload and other disorders is problematic and requires further evaluation. In this study
the efficacy, toxicity and mechanism of action of orally administered L1 were investigated in the guinea pig
using the carbonyl iron model of iron overload. In an acute trial, depletion of liver non-heme iron in drugtreated guinea pigs (normal iron status) was maximal (approximately 50% of control) after a single oral
dose of L1 of 200 mg kg–1, suggesting a limited chelatable pool in normal tissue. There was no apparent
toxicity up to 600 mg kg–1. In each of two sub-acute trials, normal and iron-loaded animals were fed L1
(300 mg kg–1 day–1) or placebo for six days. Final mortalities were 12/20 (L1) and 0/20 (placebo). Symptoms
included weakness, weight loss and eye discharge. Iron-loaded as well as normal guinea pigs were affected,
indicating that at this drug level iron loading was not protective. In a chronic trial guinea pigs received
L1 (50 mg kg–1 day–1) or placebo for six days per week over eight months. Liver non-heme iron was reduced
in animals iron-loaded prior to the trial. The increase in a wave latency (electroretinogram), the foci of
hepatic, myocardial and musculo-skeletal necrosis, and the decrease in white blood cells in the drugtreated/normal diet group even at the low dose of 50 mg kg–1 day–1 suggests that L1 may be unsuitable for
the treatment of diseases which do not involve Fe overload. However, the low level of pathology in animals
treated with iron prior to the trial suggests that even a small degree of iron overload (two-fold after eight
months) is protective at this drug level. We conclude that the relationship between drug dose and iron status
is critical in avoiding toxicity and must be monitored rigorously as cellular iron is depleted.",0

Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a potential anti-apoptotic agent for various cells. We examined the protective effect of ANGPTL4 on hypoxia/serum deprivation (SD)-induced apoptosis of MSCs, as well as the possible mechanisms. MSCs were obtained from rat bone marrow and cultured in vitro. Apoptosis was induced by hypoxia/SD for up to 24 hr, and assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Expression levels of Akt, ERK1/2, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by Western blotting. Integrin β1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed using a membrane-permeable dye. Hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated by recombinant rat ANGPTL4 in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, ANGPTL4 decreased the hypoxia/SD-induced caspase-3 cleavage and the cytochrome C release, but increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Decreased expression of integrin β1, the ANGPTL4 receptor was observed during hypoxia/SD conditions, however, such decrease was reversed by ANGPTL4. In addition, ANGPTL4 induced integrin β1-associated FAK and Src phosphorylation, which was blocked by anti-integrin β1 antibody. ANGPTL4 also reversed the hypoxia/SD-induced decrease of Akt and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, and the effect of ANGPTL4 was abolished by inhibitors of either integrins, ERK1/2, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Blocking integrinβ1, Akt or ERK largely attenuated anti-apoptotic effect of ANGPTL4. ANGPTL4 protects MSCs from hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis by interacting with integrins to stimulate FAK complex, leading to downstream ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and mimicking the pathway in which MSCs contact with the extracellular matrix.",0

Importance
Psychiatric nosology is limited by behavioral and biological heterogeneity within existing disorder categories. The imprecise nature of current nosological distinctions limits both mechanistic understanding and clinical prediction. Here, we demonstrate an approach consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to identifying superior, neurobiologically-valid subgroups with better predictive capacity than existing psychiatric categories for childhood Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Objective
Refine subtyping of childhood ADHD by using biologically-based behavioral dimensions (i.e. temperament), novel classification algorithms, and multiple external validators. In doing so, we demonstrate how refined nosology is capable of improving on current predictive capacity of long-term outcomes relative to current DSM-based nosology.

Design, Setting, Participants
437 clinically well-characterized, community-recruited children with and without ADHD participated in an on-going longitudinal study. Baseline data were used to classify children into subgroups based on temperament dimensions and to examine external validators including physiological and MRI measures. One-year longitudinal follow-up data are reported for a subgroup of the ADHD sample to address stability and clinical prediction.

Main Outcome Measures
Parent/guardian ratings of children on a measure of temperament were used as input features in novel community detection analyses to identify subgroups within the sample. Groups were validated using three widely-accepted external validators: peripheral physiology (cardiac measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period), central nervous system functioning (via resting-state functional connectivity MRI), and clinical outcomes (at one-year longitudinal follow-up).

Results
The community detection algorithm suggested three novel types of ADHD, labeled as “Mild” (normative emotion regulation); “Surgent” (extreme levels of positive approach-motivation); and “Irritable” (extreme levels of negative emotionality, anger, and poor soothability). Types were independent of existing clinical demarcations, including DSM-5 presentations or symptom severity. These types showed stability over time and were distinguished by unique patterns of cardiac physiological response, resting-state functional brain connectivity, and clinical outcome one year later.

Conclusions and Relevance
Results suggest that a biologically-informed temperament-based typology, developed with a discovery-based community detection algorithm, provided a superior description of heterogeneity in the ADHD population than any current clinical nosology. This demonstration sets the stage for more aggressive attempts at a tractable, biologically-based nosology.",0
"Abstract
We prospectively studied the clinical efficacy of an alternative cancer treatment “Psorinum Therapy” in treating stomach, gall bladder, pancreatic and liver cancers. Our study was observational, open level and single arm. The participants' eligibility criteria included histopathology/cytopathology confirmation of malignancy, inoperable tumor, and no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The primary outcome measures of the study were (i) to assess the radiological tumor response (ii) to find out how many participants survived at least 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and finally 5 years after the beginning of the study considering each type of cancer. Psorinum-6x was administered orally to all the participants up to 0.02 ml/Kg body weight as a single dose in empty stomach per day for 2 years along with allopathic and homeopathic supportive cares. 158 participants (42 of stomach, 40 of gall bladder, 44 of pancreatic, 32 of liver) were included in the final analysis of the study. Complete tumor response occurred in 28 (17.72%) cases and partial tumor response occurred in 56 (35.44%) cases. Double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial should be conducted for further scientific exploration of this alternative cancer treatment.",0
"Abstract
Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides means for unconditional secure key transmission between two distant parties. However, in practical implementations, it suffers from quantum hacking due to device imperfections. Here we propose a hybrid measurement attack, with only linear optics, homodyne detection, and single photon detection, to the widely used vacuum + weak decoy state QKD system when the phase of source is partially randomized. Our analysis shows that, in some parameter regimes, the proposed attack would result in an entanglement breaking channel but still be able to trick the legitimate users to believe they have transmitted secure keys. That is, the eavesdropper is able to steal all the key information without discovered by the users. Thus, our proposal reveals that partial phase randomization is not sufficient to guarantee the security of phase-encoding QKD systems with weak coherent states.

"Abstract
Carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) have become a growing concern in terms of their fate and toxicity in aqueous environments. Methane (CH4) is a major product of organic matter degradation in waterlogged environments. In this study, we determined the effect of MWCNTs-COOH on the production of CH4 from propionate oxidation in paddy soil enrichments. The results showed that the methanogenesis from propionate degradation was accelerated in the presence of MWCNTs-COOH. In addition, the rates of CH4 production and propionate degradation increased with increasing concentrations of MWCNTs-COOH. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed that the cells were intact and maintained their structure in the presence of MWCNTs-COOH. In addition, SEM and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images revealed that the cells were in direct contact with the MWCNTs and formed cell-MWCNTs aggregates that contained both bacteria and archaea. On the other hand, nontoxic magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) had similar effects on the CH4 production and cell integrity as the MWCNTs-COOH. Compared with no nanomaterial addition, the relative abundances of Geobacter and Methanosarcina species increased in the presence of MWCNTs-COOH. This study suggests that MWCNTs-COOH exerted positive rather than cytotoxic effects on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate in paddy soil enrichments and affected the bacterial and archaeal community structure at the test concentrations. These findings provide novel insight into the consequences of nanomaterial release into anoxic natural environments.

"Abstract
To understand and characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) has been used to induce acute and chronic colitis in animal models by causing intestinal epithelium damage. The mechanism of action of DSS in producing this outcome is not well understood. In an effort to understand how DSS might impact epithelial cell metabolism, we studied the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 incubated with 1% DSS over 56 hours using 1H NMR spectroscopy. We observed no difference in cell viability as compared to control cultures, and an approximately 1.5-fold increase in IL-6 production upon incubation with 1% DSS. The effect on Caco-2 cell metabolism as measured through changes in the concentration of metabolites in the cell supernatant included a three-fold decrease in the concentration of alanine. Given that the concentrations of other amino acids in the cell culture supernatant were not different between treated and control cultures over 56 hours suggest that DSS inhibits alanine synthesis, specifically alanine aminotransferase, without affecting other key metabolic pathways. The importance of alanine aminotransferase in inflammatory bowel disease is discussed.

"Abstract
Anecdotal and clinical reports have suggested that radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs) may serve as a trigger for neuropathic pain. However, these reports have been widely disregarded, as the epidemiological effects of electromagnetic fields have not been systematically proven, and are highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that anthropogenic RF EMFs elicit post-neurotomy pain in a tibial neuroma transposition model. Behavioral assays indicate a persistent and significant pain response to RF EMFs when compared to SHAM surgery groups. Laser thermometry revealed a transient skin temperature increase during stimulation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed an increased expression of temperature sensitive cation channels (TRPV4) in the neuroma bulb, suggesting that RF EMF-induced pain may be due to cytokine-mediated channel dysregulation and hypersensitization, leading to thermal allodynia. Additional behavioral assays were performed using an infrared heating lamp in place of the RF stimulus. While thermally-induced pain responses were observed, the response frequency and progression did not recapitulate the RF EMF effects. In vitro calcium imaging experiments demonstrated that our RF EMF stimulus is sufficient to directly contribute to the depolarization of dissociated sensory neurons. Furthermore, the perfusion of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α resulted in a significantly higher percentage of active sensory neurons during RF EMF stimulation. These results substantiate patient reports of RF EMF-pain, in the case of peripheral nerve injury, while confirming the public and scientific consensus that anthropogenic RF EMFs engender no adverse sensory effects in the general population.",0

Youth in poor neighborhoods have high emotional problem rates. Understanding neighborhood influences on these rates is crucial for designing neighborhood-level interventions.

Objective
To do exploratory analysis of associations between housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty neighborhoods and subsequent mental disorders during adolescence.

Design, Setting, and Participants
The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration in 1994-1998 randomized 4,604 volunteer public housing families with children in high-poverty neighborhoods into Low-poverty voucher (LPV) or Traditional voucher (TRV) interventions to encourage moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods or a Control group. An evaluation 10-15 years later (June 2008-April 2010)interviewed (blinded to assignment) participants aged 0-8 at randomization and 13-19 at follow-up. Response rates were 86.9-92.9%.

Interventions
LPV (n=1,430) received vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods with enhanced mobility counseling. TRV (n=1,081) received geographically unrestricted vouchers. Controls (n=1,178) received no intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures
Twelve-month DSM-IV major depressive, panic, post-traumatic stress (PTSD), oppositional-defiant, intermittent explosive, and conduct disorders assessed post hoc with a validated research diagnostic interview.

Results
3,689 children were randomized and 2,872 interviewed (1,407 boys, median age 16 range: 13-19; 1,465 girls, median age 16, range 13-19). Boys had significantly elevated rates of major depression in LPV (7.1% [95% CI, 4.1-10.1%]; OR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2-3.9]) versus Controls (3.5% [95% CI, 2.3-4.6%]), PTSD in LPV (6.2% [95% CI, 4.7-7.7%]; OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.4]) and TRV (4.9% [95% CI, 3.0-6.8%]; OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.2-5.8]) versus Controls (1.9% [95% CI, 0.9-2.9%]), and conduct disorder in LPV (6.4% [95% CI, 4.7-8.1%];OR, 3.1[95% CI, 1.7-5.8]) versus Controls (2.1% [95% CI, 1.1-3.2%]). TRV girls had reduced rates of major depression (6.5% [95% CI, 4.5-8.4%]; OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-0.9 ]) versus Controls (10.9% [95% CI, 8.4-13.4%]) and conduct disorder (0.3% [95% CI, 0.0-0.7%]; OR, 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.4]) versus Controls (2.9% [95% CI, 1.1-4.7%]).

Conclusions and Relevance
Interventions to encourage moving from high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with elevated depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes.

"Abstract
The biogenesis and activity of chloroplasts in both vascular plants and algae depends on an intracellular network of nucleus-encoded, trans-acting factors that control almost all aspects of organellar gene expression. Most of these regulatory factors belong to the helical repeat protein superfamily, which includes tetratricopeptide repeat, pentatricopeptide repeat, and the recently identified octotricopeptide repeat (OPR) proteins. Whereas green algae express many different OPR proteins, only a single orthologous OPR protein is encoded in the genomes of most land plants. Here, we report the characterization of the only OPR protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, RAP, which has previously been implicated in plant pathogen defense. Loss of RAP led to a severe defect in processing of chloroplast 16S rRNA resulting in impaired chloroplast translation and photosynthesis. In vitro RNA binding and RNase protection assays revealed that RAP has an intrinsic and specific RNA binding capacity, and the RAP binding site was mapped to the 5′ region of the 16S rRNA precursor. Nucleoid localization of RAP was shown by transient green fluorescent protein import assays, implicating the nucleoid as the site of chloroplast rRNA processing. Taken together, our data indicate that the single OPR protein in Arabidopsis is important for a basic process of chloroplast biogenesis.",0

The thermal behavior of heavy metals in the co-incineration of municipal solid waste-sludge incinerator fly ash (MSS fly ash) was studied using a laboratory-scale tube furnace. The results indicate that without the addition of chlorinating agents, temperature was an important parameter and had significantly influenced on heavy metal removal, whereas the residence time had a weak effect. Between 900 and 1000 °C for 60 to 300 min, heavy metals reacted with chloride-inherent in the fly ash, and approximately 80 to 89% of Pb, 48% to 56% of Cd, 27% to 36% of Zn and 6% to 24% of Cu were removed. After the adding chlorinating agents, the evaporation rate of the heavy metals improved dramatically, where the evaporation rates of Cu and Zn were larger than that of Pb and Cd. As the amount of added chlorinating agents increased, the removal rate of heavy metals increased. However, the effect of the type of chlorinating agent on the chlorination of heavy metals differed considerably, where NaCl had the weakest effect on the removal rate of Cu, Cd and Zn. In terms of resource recovery and decontamination, MgCl2 and CaCl2 are the best choices due to their efficient removal of Zn.",0
"Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed as being a signaling molecule in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf senescence. Intracellular H2O2 levels are controlled by the H2O2-scavenging enzyme catalase in concert with other scavenging and producing systems. Catalases are encoded by a small gene family, and the expression of all three Arabidopsis catalase genes is regulated in a senescence-associated manner. CATALASE2 (CAT2) expression is down-regulated during bolting time at the onset of leaf senescence and appears to be involved in the elevation of the H2O2 level at this time point. To understand the role of CAT2 in senescence regulation in more detail, we used CAT2 promoter fragments in a yeast one-hybrid screen to isolate upstream regulatory factors. Among others, we could identify G-Box Binding Factor1 (GBF1) as a DNA-binding protein of the CAT2 promoter. Transient overexpression of GBF1 together with a CAT2:β-glucuronidase construct in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants and Arabidopsis protoplasts revealed a negative effect of GBF1 on CAT2 expression. In gbf1 mutant plants, the CAT2 decrease in expression and activity at bolting time and the increase in H2O2 could no longer be observed. Consequently, the onset of leaf senescence and the expression of senescence-associated genes were delayed in gbf1 plants, clearly indicating a regulatory function of GBF1 in leaf senescence, most likely via regulation of the intracellular H2O2 content.",0

Background. Treatment selection for small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) is controversial. We aimed to compare the outcomes of medical imaging three-dimensional visualization system (MI-3DVS) guided surgical resection (SR) and ultrasonography guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for sHCC. Methods. In total, 194 patients who underwent SR or RFA in our hospital between January 2006 and May 2010 were retrospectively enrolled. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and postoperative complications were compared. Cox regression was used to estimate the benefits of MI-3DVS-guided SR on OS and RFS. Results. Ninety-two patients underwent SR and 102 underwent RFA. The SR group experienced more complications (41.3% versus 19.6%) and longer hospital stay (18.04 ± 7.11 versus 13.06 ± 5.59) (both p < 0.05). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS was 96.7%, 95.7%, 93.5%, 83.5%, and 61.1% in the SR group and 95.0%, 88.1%, 72.7%, 56.9%, and 39.5% in the RFA group. Corresponding RFS was 95.7%, 94.6%, 84.7%, 59.8%, and 40.2% in SR group and 91.2%, 80.3%, 60.5%, 32.3%, and 22.3% in RFA group. The 5-year OS and RFS were higher in SR group (both p < 0.001). Interestingly, there was no significance in OS and RFS among subgroups aged >60 years. Independent predictors of OS and RFS, respectively, were intervention (HR, 2.769 and 1.933), tumor number (HR, 5.128 and 3.903), and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR, 1.871 and 1.474) (all p < 0.05). Conclusions. MI-3DVS based hepatectomy should be considered primary treatment while RFA can be treated as alternative therapy for older patients. Intervention, tumor number, and AFP are independent predictors for both survival and recurrence.",0
"Abstract
The initiation of DNA replication is a highly regulated process in eukaryotic cells, and central to the process of initiation is the assembly and activation of the replication fork helicase. The replication fork helicase is comprised of CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2–7, and GINS) in eukaryotic cells, and the mechanism underlying assembly of the CMG during S phase was studied in this article. We identified a point mutation of Sld3 that is specifically defective for Mcm3 and Mcm5 interaction (sld3-m10), and also identified a point mutation of Sld3 that is specifically defective for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) interaction (sld3-m9). Expression of wild-type levels of sld3-m9 resulted in a severe DNA replication defect with no recruitment of GINS to Mcm2–7, whereas expression of wild-type levels of sld3-m10 resulted in a severe replication defect with no Cdc45 recruitment to Mcm2–7. We propose a model for Sld3-mediated control of replication initiation, wherein Sld3 manages the proper assembly of the CMG during S phase. We also find that the biochemical functions identified for Sld3 are conserved in human Treslin, suggesting that Treslin orchestrates assembly of the CMG in human cells.",0

Functional interactions between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during working memory have been studied extensively as an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. Coupling abnormalities have been found in patients, their unaffected siblings, and carriers of common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, but the global genetic architecture of this imaging phenotype is unclear. To achieve genome-wide hypothesis-free identification of genes and pathways associated with prefrontal–hippocampal interactions, we combined gene set enrichment analysis with whole-genome genotyping and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 269 healthy German volunteers. We found significant enrichment of the synapse organization and biogenesis gene set. This gene set included known schizophrenia risk genes, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, beta 2 subunit (CACNB2), as well as genes with well-defined roles in neurodevelopmental and plasticity processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and have mechanistic links to prefrontal–hippocampal functional interactions. Our results demonstrate a readily generalizable approach that can be used to identify the neurogenetic basis of systems-level phenotypes. Moreover, our findings identify gene sets in which genetic variation may contribute to disease risk through altered prefrontal–hippocampal functional interactions and suggest a link to both ongoing and developmental synaptic plasticity.",0
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) can phosphorylate
and degrade β-catenin, and negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. MiR-224
up-regulation is associated with colorectal
cancer (CRC). Bioinformatics analysis showed
complementary binding sites between miR-224
and GSK-3β. This study investigated if miR-224
plays a role in mediating GSK-3β expression,
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity, CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis as well as drug sensitivity of
Adriamycin (ADM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual luciferase gene reporter assay demonstrated the regulatory relationship between miR-224 and GSK3β. Expression of miR-224, GSK-3β, β-catenin, and Survivin was measured in normal colon
epithelium NCM460, CRC cell line SW480, and
drug-resistant SW480/ADM cell line. Flow cytometry measured apoptosis under ADM with
an IC50 concentration of SW480 cells, followed
by CCK-8 analysis of cell proliferation. SW480/
ADM cells were treated with miR-224 inhibitor
and/or pSicoR-GSK-3β, followed by analysis of
the expressions of GSK-3β, β-catenin and Survivin, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation by
EdU staining.
RESULTS: MiR-224 targeted and inhibited
GSK-3β expression. In SW480/ADM cells, GSK3β expression and cell apoptosis rate were lower than those in SW480 cells, whilst miR-224,
β-catenin, and Survivin expression or proliferation were higher than those in SW480 cells.
Transfection of miR-224 inhibitor and/or pSicoR-GSK-3β significantly increased GSK-3β expression in SW480/ADM cells, and decreased
β-catenin and Survivin expression, leading to
reduced proliferation potency, enhanced cell
apoptosis and suppressed ADM resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-224 up-regulation is associated with ADM resistance of CRC cells. Suppression of miR-224 expression up-regulated
GSK-3β expression, inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway activity and Survivin expression, as
well as reduced ADM resistance of CRC SW480

Hypidone hydrochloride (YL-0919), is a novel structural antidepressant candidate as a triple selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), 5-HT1A partial agonist and 5-HT6 agonist.

In the CUS rats, it was found that fluoxetine (FLX, 10 mg/kg) treatment exerted antidepressant actions on 20-22d, while YL-0919 or vilazodone (VLZ, a dual 5-HT1A partial agonist and SSRI) administrated once daily exerted faster antidepressant-like behaviors [4 days in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and 6 days in the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF)]. Thereafter, the serum corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were reversed by treatment with YL-0919 for 7 days. Furthermore, YL-0919 treatment for 5 days reversed the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and the key synaptic proteins, such as post-synaptic density (PSD95), GluR1 and presynaptic protein synapsin1. Meanwhile, the dendritic complexity of pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) were also increased in the CUS rats. These data suggest that YL-0919 exerts a faster antidepressant-like effect on behaviors and this effect maybe at least partially mediated by the BDNF-mTOR signaling related dendritic complexity increase in the PFC.",1

Abstract
There is an association between very low birth weight (VLBW) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Aerobic fitness, measured as the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), is a good indicator of cardiopulmonary health and predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Our aim was to determine the effect of birth weight on aerobic exercise capacity and physical activity. We systematically identified studies reporting exercise capacity (VO2 max and VO2 peak) and physical activity levels in participants born at VLBW aged eighteen years or older compared to term-born controls from six databases (MEDLINE, OVID, EMBASE, CI NAHL, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar). Meta-analysis of eligible studies was conducted using a random effect model. We screened 6202 articles and identified 15 relevant studies, 10 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. VLBW participants had a lower VO2 max compared to their term counterparts (−3.35, 95% CI: −5.23 to −1.47, p = 0.0005), as did VLBW adults who had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (−6.08, 95% CI −11.26 to −0.90, p = 0.02). Five of nine studies reported significantly reduced self-reported physical activity levels. Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated reduced maximal aerobic exercise capacity in adults born at VLBW compared to term-born controls.

"ABSTRACT
The effectiveness of stroke order learning in promoting Chinese character recognition among
Chinese as a second language (CSL) learners has been a subject of ongoing controversy in teaching
practice and empirical research. The present study employed a computer-assisted stroke order
learning system to investigate the impact of stroke order learning on Chinese character recognition for CSL learners. We compared the performance of CSL learners in memorizing the
orthography, semantics, and pronunciation of Chinese characters with varying stroke numbers
under different stroke order learning conditions (correct stroke order, random stroke order, and
no stroke order). Both immediate and delayed tests showed that learning correct stroke order
exhibited shorter response times and higher accuracy in tasks related to orthographic discrimination and form-meaning matching compared to the other two learning conditions. Furthermore,
correct stroke order has a more pronounced effect on the visual orthographic processing of highcomplexity Chinese characters. These findings suggest that correct stroke order plays an important role in helping CSL learners form and solidify more accurate orthographic representations
and establish long-term memory for orthography-semantics link. Consequently, this study underscores the need to prioritize and reinforce stroke order learning in Chinese character
instruction. ",1
"Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by lipotoxicity and ectopic lipid deposition within hepatocytes. Sulforaphane (SFA), an active compound used for inhibiting tumors, was found to have the potency to improve lipid metabolism. However, its molecular mechanisms on ameliorating NAFLD are still incompletely understood. This research evaluated if SFA could inhibit hepatic steatosis and apoptosis. The effects of SFA on cell viability, lipid accumulation, triglyceride (TG) contents, apoptosis, ceramide contents, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed in palmitic acid (PA)-treated HepG2 cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The related molecular mechanisms were further explored in hepatocytes. The results showed SFA alleviated lipid accumulation and regulated AMPK/SREBP1c/FAS signaling pathway in PA-stressed HepG2 cells. In addition, SFA alleviated PA-mediated apoptosis, downregulated the expressions of cleaved caspase 3, as well as reduced ceramide contents and ROS levels. Moreover, SFA treatment reduced HFD-induced body weight gain, alleviated insulin resistance, decreased serum TG, total cholesterol (TC), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and prevented lipid deposition and apoptosis in the liver. This study showed SFA suppressed lipid deposition and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that SFA may be a potential candidate for preventing and treating NAFLD.

Background
Sarcopenia is a serious public health concern among older adults worldwide. Exercise is the most common intervention for sarcopenia. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different exercise types for older adults with sarcopenia.

Methods
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of exercise interventions on patient-important outcomes for older adults with sarcopenia were eligible. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Ovid until 3 June 2022. We used frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses to summarize the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations framework to rate the certainty of evidence.

Results
Our search identified 5988 citations, of which 42 RCTs proved eligible with 3728 participants with sarcopenia (median age: 72.9 years, female: 73.3%) with a median follow-up of 12 weeks. We are interested in patient-important outcomes that include mortality, quality of life, muscle strength and physical function measures. High or moderate certainty evidence suggested that resistance exercise with or without nutrition and the combination of resistance exercise with aerobic and balance training were the most effective interventions for improving quality of life compared to usual care (standardized mean difference from 0.68 to 1.11). Moderate certainty evidence showed that resistance and balance exercise plus nutrition (mean difference [MD]: 4.19 kg) was the most effective for improving handgrip strength (minimally important difference [MID]: 5 kg). Resistance and balance exercise with or without nutrition (MD: 0.16 m/s, moderate) were the most effective for improving physical function measured by usual gait speed (MID: 0.1 m/s). Moderate certainty evidence showed that resistance and balance exercise (MD: 1.85 s) was intermediately effective for improving physical function measured by timed up and go test (MID: 2.1 s). High certainty evidence showed that resistance and aerobic, or resistance and balance, or resistance and aerobic exercise plus nutrition (MD from 1.72 to 2.28 s) were intermediately effective for improving physical function measured by the five-repetition chair stand test (MID: 2.3 s).

Conclusions
In older adults with sarcopenia, high or moderate certainty evidence showed that resistance exercise with or without nutrition and the combination of resistance exercise with aerobic and balance training were the most effective interventions for improving quality of life. Adding nutritional interventions to exercise had a larger effect on handgrip strength than exercise alone while showing a similar effect on other physical function measures.",1

"Abstract
Innovation in green technologies is a key factor propelling Jordanian sustainable development in the small and medium enterprises for achieving sustainability. Jordan is considered as a hub of small and medium enterprises, however, despite technological advancements and the efforts of the government, small and medium enterprises in Jordan are scarcely catering the aspect of green activities and researchers have paid less attention towards the same. Green product and green process innovation mode choices have drawn enough attention recently, but limited researchers have thoroughly examined the pathways through which green innovation is transmitted to small and medium enterprises’ performance. Green product and process innovation are the two main streams of green innovation that can enhance small and medium enterprises’ performance. The current research builds the framework for SMEs performance based on green product innovation and green process innovation following earlier research that have been conducted in the context of developed countries. It conducts an empirical analysis using responses of 384 manufacturing sector small and medium enterprises in Jordan. The findings demonstrate that small and medium enterprises can perform better when green products and processes are innovated. One significant moderating variable over the performance paths of small and medium enterprises is technological turbulence. The findings of the research contribute to a better understanding of green innovation and have implications for designing policies that promote green development.",1
"Abstract
Osteosarcopenia is the coexistence of low bone mass and sarcopenia. In older women, its prevalence is not well described, and it is unknown if sarcopenia is additive to low bone mass for fracture and mortality risk. The study investigated prevalence of osteosarcopenia and if osteosarcopenia is associated with higher fracture and mortality risk than low bone mass alone in older community-dwelling women. The longitudinal, population-based OPRA Cohort (n = 1044), all aged 75 at inclusion, followed for 10 years. Using WHO and EWGSOP2 definitions for low bone mass (T-score < −1.0 femoral neck) and sarcopenia (knee strength; appendicular lean muscle mass) women were categorized (1) Normal, (2) Low bone mass (LBM), and 3) Osteosarcopenia (probable; confirmed). Risk of hip, major osteoporotic fracture, and mortality were estimated. Osteosarcopeniaconfirmed prevalence increased from age 75 to 80 and 85 from 3.0% (29/970) to 4.9% (32/656) to 9.2% (33/358) but prevalence is potentially 2–4 times higher (11.8%, 13.4%, 20.3%) based on osteosarcopeniaprobable. Having osteosarcopeniaprobable significantly increased 10-year risk of hip fracture (HRadj 2.67 [1.34–5.32]), major osteoporotic fracture (HRadj 2.04 [1.27–3.27]), and mortality (HRadj 1.91 [1.21–3.04]). In contrast, LBM increased osteoporotic fracture risk (HRadj 2.08 [1.46–2.97], but not hip fracture (HRadj 1.62 [0.92–2.85]) or mortality (HRadj 0.94 [0.64–1.38]). Median time-to-hip fracture was 7.6 years (normal), 6.0 years (LBM), and 5.7 years (osteosarcopeniaprobable). Prevalence of confirmed osteosarcopenia is almost 10% at age 85. Probable osteosarcopenia significantly increased risk of hip and major osteoporotic fractures and mortality more so than low bone mass alone.",1

Background
Prior studies have shown benefit for endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with large‐vessel occlusion and severe deficits, as captured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). However, the benefit of EVT in patients with NIHSS score of <6 is unclear.
Methods
We queried the National Inpatient Sample (2018–2020) for patients with a large‐vessel occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery with an NIHSS score of <6, and compared outcomes between patients treated with EVT versus best medical management, using propensity score matching. The primary outcome was routine discharge (home or self‐care). Secondary outcomes were in‐hospital mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage, and length of stay. Primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression adjusted for baseline characteristics, stroke severity, and treatment with thrombolysis.
Results
Of the 212 515 patients with an internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery stroke, 49 115 met the inclusion criteria for our study. There were 3490 (7.1%) patients treated with EVT and 45 625 (92.9%) treated with best medical management. Patients treated with EVT had no difference in ofdds of routine discharge (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82–1.19; P = 0.91), but there were longer lengths of hospital stay (adjusted β, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.78–1.74; P<0.001) and higher rates of death (adjusted OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.20–3.70; P = 0.01), compared with patients treated with best medical management. In multivariable models, intravenous thrombolysis was independently associated with higher odds of routine discharge (adjusted OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.57–2.01; P<0.001) and shorter hospital stay (adjusted β, −0.41; 95% CI, −0.63 to −0.19; P<0.001), but no difference in in‐hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.39–1.24; P = 0.22). These relationships persisted in the propensity‐matched cohort.
Conclusion
Patients treated with EVT compared with best medical management had worse clinical outcomes, and this may be attributable to residual confounding (eg, deterioration following an initially low NIHSS score) or procedural factors. Patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis had greater odds of routine discharge. Our findings suggest potential real‐world benefits for intravenous thrombolysis in patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery and low NIHSS score.",1
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting cognitive functions. However, sensory deficits in AD start to draw attention due to their high prevalence and early onsets which suggest that they could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers and even contribute to the disease progression. This literature review examines the sensory deficits and cortical pathological changes observed in visual, auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory systems in AD patients, as well as in various AD animal models. Sensory deficits may emerge at the early stages of AD, or even precede the cognitive decline, which is accompanied by cortical pathological changes including amyloid-beta deposition, tauopathy, gliosis, and alterations in neuronal excitability, synaptic inputs, and functional plasticity. Notably, these changes are more pronounced in sensory association areas and superficial cortical layers, which may explain the relative preservation of basic sensory functions but early display of deficits of higher sensory functions. We propose that sensory impairment and the progression of AD may establish a cyclical relationship that mutually perpetuates each condition. This review highlights the significance of sensory deficits with or without cortical pathological changes in AD and emphasizes the need for further research to develop reliable early detection and intervention through sensory systems.",1
"Abstract
The prevalence of glomerulonephritis (GN), especially membranous GN (MGN), changes from time to time. This change may be due to genetic predisposition, environmental factors race, age, and indications for a renal biopsy. This study was conducted to evaluate the distribution and changing patterns of GN by further assessing the prevalence of MGN. A 1000, 123 biopsies were performed from January 2012 to October 2019 in Hospital Serdang and Hospital Kuala Lumpur. Electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and clinical presentations were used to differentiate primary and secondary MGN, from which 611 and 457 primary and secondary subjects were diagnosed with primary and secondary GN, respectively. Primary MGN accounts for 13% of all the primary GN, while lupus nephritis (LN) accounts for 44.2% of all secondary GN followed by diabetes mellitus (25.6%). The proportions of primary and secondary MGN were 64.8% and 35.2%, respectively, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.1 in favor of females. The renal biopsy obtained from the registry of two prominent hospitals in Malaysia provided valuable prevalence and demonstrated changes in the prevalence of GN in Malaysia. Notwithstanding, immunoglobulin A nephropathy and LN remain the most common causes of primary and secondary GN in Malaysia.",1

Background
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the primary source of dietary added sugars in children, with high consumption commonly observed in more deprived areas where obesity prevalence is also highest. Associations between SSB consumption and obesity in children have been widely reported. In March 2016, a two-tier soft drinks industry levy (SDIL) on drinks manufacturers to encourage reformulation of SSBs in the United Kingdom was announced and then implemented in April 2018. We examined trajectories in the prevalence of obesity at ages 4 to 5 years and 10 to 11 years, 19 months after the implementation of SDIL, overall and by sex and deprivation.

Methods and findings
Data were from the National Child Measurement Programme and included annual repeat cross-sectional measurement of over 1 million children in reception (4 to 5 years old) and year 6 (10 to 11 years old) in state-maintained English primary schools. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of monthly obesity prevalence data from September 2013 to November 2019 was used to estimate absolute and relative changes in obesity prevalence compared to a counterfactual (adjusted for temporal variations in obesity prevalence) estimated from the trend prior to SDIL announcement. Differences between observed and counterfactual estimates were examined in November 2019 by age (reception or year 6) and additionally by sex and deprivation quintile. In year 6 girls, there was an overall absolute reduction in obesity prevalence (defined as >95th centile on the UK90 growth charts) of 1.6 percentage points (PPs) (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.1), with greatest reductions in the two most deprived quintiles (e.g., there was an absolute reduction of 2.4 PP (95% CI: 1.6, 3.2) in prevalence of obesity in the most deprived quintile). In year 6 boys, there was no change in obesity prevalence, except in the least deprived quintile where there was a 1.6-PP (95% CI: 0.7, 2.5) absolute increase. In reception children, relative to the counterfactual, there were no overall changes in obesity prevalence in boys (0.5 PP (95% CI: 1.0, −0.1)) or girls (0.2 PP (95% CI: 0.8, −0.3)). This study is limited by use of index of multiple deprivation of the school attended to assess individual socioeconomic disadvantage. ITS analyses are vulnerable to unidentified cointerventions and time-varying confounding, neither of which we can rule out.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that the SDIL was associated with decreased prevalence of obesity in year 6 girls, with the greatest differences in those living in the most deprived areas. Additional strategies beyond SSB taxation will be needed to reduce obesity prevalence overall, and particularly in older boys and younger children.",1
"Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological occurrence that usually leads to a loss of motor and sensory function in patients. Axon regeneration has been reported to be crucial for recovery after trauma to the nervous system. Morin, a natural bioflavonoid obtained from the Moraceae family, has previously been reported to exert neuroprotective effects. In our study, we investigated the protective effects of morin on PC12 cells and primary neurons treated with oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and its function in an SCI model. In vitro experiments showed that treating neuronal cells with morin enhanced axonal regeneration after OGD treatment by regulating microtubule stabilization and protecting mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, morin protected neuronal cells exposed to OGD by activating the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. An in vivo study illustrated that oral morin administration improved microtubule stability and promoted axon regeneration in SCI rats. Taken together, this study showed that treatment with morin improves functional recovery after SCI and that morin may serve as a potential agent for treating SCI.",1

Workplace violence on health workers in the workplace causes physical and psychological problems. Negative impacts on victims of workplace violence such as physical problems, anxiety, depression, stress, and risk of death or risk of suicide. This problem needs to be addressed immediately so as not to impact post-traumatic stress disorder and reduce the work performance of health workers. The purpose of this study is to explore interventions to reduce the negative impact of workplace violence on health workers. This study used scoping review design with a descriptive approach to data analysis. The CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used in this investigation. This study used PCC’s framework (Population, Content, Context). The keywords are workplace violence, healthcare personnel, interventions, and programs were used by the authors. Search strategy used PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The sample are health workers, original research used a randomized control trial or quasi-experiment design, and the publication time had to be within the previous ten years (2014–2023). The JBI assessment was used to assess the quality of the article. We found 11 articles who discuss about interventions to reduce negative effects of workplace violence among health workers. This study shows that there is a decrease in psychological problems in victims of workplace violence such as anxiety, depression, and incidents of workplace violence. The range of sample in this study are 30–440 respondents. The authors discovered three different types of interventions: training programs, cognitive behavior therapy, and workplace violence programs. Interventions must focus on both the physical and psychological needs of the victims of workplace violence, psychiatric nurses and psychologists carried out interventions in a thorough manner. Interventions carried out by psychiatric nurses and psychologists can reduce the negative impact of workplace violence on health workers such as anxiety, depression and other psychological problems.",1
"Abstract
Stress during critical periods of neurodevelopment is associated with an increased risk of
developing stress-related psychiatric disorders which are more common in women than men.
Hippocampal neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons) is vulnerable to maternal separation
and inflammatory stressors, and emerging evidence suggests that hippocampal neurogenesis
is more sensitive to stress in the ventral hippocampus (vHi) than in the dorsal hippocampus
(dHi). Although research into the effects of maternal separation stress on hippocampal
neurogenesis is well documented in male rodents, the effect in females remains
underexplored. Similarly, reports on the impact of inflammatory stressors on hippocampal
neurogenesis in females are limited, especially when female bias the in prevalence of stressrelated psychiatric disorders begins to emerge. Thus, in this study we investigated the effects
of maternal separation (MS) followed by an inflammatory stressor (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)
in early adolescence on peripheral and hippocampal inflammatory responses and
hippocampal neurogenesis in juvenile female rats. We show that MS enhanced an LPSinduced increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 in the vHi but not in the dHi.
However, microglial activation was similar following LPS alone or MS alone in both
hippocampal regions, while MS prior to LPS reduced microglial activation in both dHi and vHi.
The production of new neurons was unaffected by MS and LPS. MS and LPS independently
reduced the dendritic complexity of new neurons, and MS exacerbated LPS-induced
reductions in complexity of distal dendrites of new neurons in the vHi but not dHi. These data
highlight that MS differentially primes the physiological response to LPS in the juvenile female
rat hippocampus. ",1
"Abstract
Psittacula cyanocephala is an endemic parakeet from the Indian sub-continent that is widespread in the illegal bird trade. Previous studies on Psittacula parakeets have highlighted taxonomic ambiguities, warranting studies to resolve the issues. Since the mitochondrial genome provides useful information concerning the species evolution and phylogenetics, we sequenced the complete mitogenome of P. cyanocephala using NGS, validated 38.86% of the mitogenome using Sanger Sequencing and compared it with other available whole mitogenomes of Psittacula. The complete mitogenome of the species was 16814 bp in length with 54.08% AT composition. P. cyanocephala mitogenome comprises of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. P. cyanocephala mitogenome organization was consistent with other Psittacula mitogenomes. Comparative codon usage analysis indicated the role of natural selection on Psittacula mitogenomes. Strong purifying selection pressure was observed maximum on nad1 and nad4l genes. The mitochondrial control region of all Psittacula species displayed the ancestral avian CR gene order. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the Psittacula genus as paraphyletic nature, containing at least 4 groups of species within the same genus, suggesting its taxonomic reconsideration. Our results provide useful information for developing forensic tests to control the illegal trade of the species and scientific basis for phylogenetic revision of the genus Psittacula.",1
"Infection, sterile injury, and chronic inflammation trigger the acute phase response in order to re-establish homeostasis. This response includes production of positive acute phase proteins in the liver, such as members of the serum amyloid A (SAA) family. In humans the major acute phase SAAs comprise a group of closely related variants of SAA1 and SAA2. SAA1 was proven to be chemotactic for several leukocyte subtypes through activation of the G protein-coupled receptor FPRL1/FPR2. Several other biological activities of SAA1, such as cytokine induction, reported to be mediated via TLRs, have been debated recently. Especially commercial SAA1, recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli, was found to be contaminated with bacterial products confounding biological assays performed with this rSAA1. We purified rSAA1 by RP-HPLC to homogeneity, removing contaminants such as lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins and formylated peptides, and re-assessed several biological activities attributed to SAA1 (chemotaxis, cytokine induction, MMP-9 release, ROS generation, and macrophage differentiation). The homogeneous rSAA1 (hrSAA1) lacked most cell-activating properties, but its leukocyte-recruiting capacity in vivo and it’s in vitro synergy with other leukocyte attractants remained preserved. Furthermore, hrSAA1 maintained the ability to promote monocyte survival. This indicates that pure hrSAA1 retains its potential to activate FPR2, whereas TLR-mediated effects seem to be related to traces of bacterial TLR ligands in the E. coli-produced human rSAA1.",1
"Abstract
This study established a constant-temperature fluorescence quantitative detection method, combining loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with molecular beacons. The advantages of LAMP are its convenience and efficiency, as it does not require a thermocycler and results are easily visualized by the naked eye. However, a major disadvantage of current LAMP techniques is the use of indirect evaluation methods (e.g., electrophoresis, SYBR Green I dye, precipitation, hydroxynaphthol blue dye, the turbidimetric method, calcein/Mn2+ dye, and the composite probe method), which cannot distinguish between the desired products and products of nonspecific amplification, thereby leading to false positives. Use of molecular beacons avoids this problem because molecular beacons produce fluorescence signals only when binding to target DNA, thus acting as a direct indicator of amplification products. Our analyses determined the optimal conditions for molecular beacons as an evaluation tool in LAMP: beacon length of 25–45 bp, beacon concentration of 0.6–1 pmol/μL, and reaction temperature of 60–65 °C. In conclusion, we validated a novel molecular beacon loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (MB-LAMP), realizing the direct detection of LAMP product.",1

Ethnopharmacological relevance: As a well-known traditional Chinese medicine,
Amomi fructus (A. fructus) (Sharen) has been used therapeutically to treat
gastrointestinal illnesses, including gastric ulcer (GU). The mechanism underlying
this impact is still not fully known, though.
Aim of the study: To investigate the hidden mechanism by which A. fructus influences
the pathogenesis of GU, we employed network pharmacology approaches and in vivo
validated studies.
This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4463115
Preprint not peer reviewed
Materials and methods: Multiple public databases were used to compile information
on bioactive compounds, potential targets of A. fructus, and associated genes of GU.
Then, the STRING database's protein-protein interaction (PPI) data of the drugdisease overloping gene targets was obtained, and the core targets for A. fructus
against GU were discovered. Additionally, molecular docking was done to examine
the binding capabilities of the active substances and core targets. Then, the pathways
of A. fructus that target GU were examined using the Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID)'s Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway studies. In a mouse model of acute stomach
mucosal damage brought on by absolute ethanol, the findings of network
pharmacology were finally validated.
Results: In total, 610 targets derived from the 196 bioactive compounds in A. fructus,
were discovered, and along with 115 A. fructus target genes for therapy of GU. Then,
ten core targets associated with apoptosis and inflammation were determined based on
node degree, and ALB, AKT1, TNF, EGFR, MAPK3, CASP3, MMP9, STAT3, SRC,
and HRAS were identified as promising therapeutic targets of A. fructus against GU.
The results of molecular docking also revealed that 65 active compounds had strong
binding activity with the core targets, with volatile chemicals being the most
significant active ingredients. So, for following in vivo tests, A. fructus volatile oils
(AVO) were used. The KEGG analysis showed that the phosphoinositide-3-
kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway may be crucial for the
therapeutic mechanism of GU.
Conclusion: According to preliminary findings from this work, A. fructus may
influence inflammatory response and apoptosis via regulating the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway and associated gene targets. Importantly, our research might offer a
theoretical foundation for future research into the intricate anti-GU mechanism of A.
fructus.

Thyroid cancers require complex and heterogeneous therapies with different impacts on renal function. In our systematic literature review, we analyzed several aspects: renal function assessment, the impact of radiotherapy and thyroid surgery on kidney functioning, and mechanisms of nephrotoxicity of different chemotherapy, targeted and immunologic drugs. Our study revealed that the renal impact of thyroid cancer therapy can be a limiting factor in all radiotherapy, surgery, and pharmacological approaches. It is advisable to conduct a careful nephrological follow-up imposing the application of body surface based estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) formulas for the purpose of an early diagnosis and treatment of renal failure, guaranteeing the therapy continuation to thyroid cancer patients.

"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a cell surface receptor for
high density lipoproteins. It also binds oxidized low density lipoproteins and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPL), which adversely affect bone homeostasis. Overexpression of a single chain form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 IgM–a
natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPL–increases trabecular and cortical bone mass in
female and male mice by stimulating bone formation. We have previously reported that
Scarb1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for PC-OxPL in calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells. Additionally, bone marrow- and calvaria-derived osteoblasts from Scarb1
knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating
effects of OxPL. Previous skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice has produced contradictory
results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass but another study reporting low
bone mass. To clarify the role of Scarb1 in osteoblasts, we deleted Scarb1 specifically in
cells of the osteoblast lineage using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. We observed no difference
in bone mineral density measured by DXA in either female or male Osx1-Cre;Scarb1fl/fl
mice compared to wild type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. Additionally,
microCT analysis of 6-month-old females and 7-month-old males did not detect any difference in trabecular or cortical bone mass between genotypes. These results indicate that
expression of Scarb1 in cells of the osteoblast lineage does not play an important role in
bone homeostasis and, therefore, it is not essential for the effects of PC-OxPL on these
cells.",1
"The scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1 or Scarb1) is a glycosylated cell surface receptor for high density lipoproteins (HDL), oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL), and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPLs). Scarb1 is expressed in macrophages and has been shown to have both pro- and anti-atherogenic properties. It has been reported that global deletion of Scarb1 in mice leads to either high or low bone mass and that PC-OxPLs decrease osteoblastogenesis and increase osteoclastogenesis. PC-OxPLs decrease bone mass in 6-month-old mice and are critical pathogenetic factors in the bone loss caused by high fat diet or aging. We have investigated here whether Scarb1 expression in myeloid cells affects bone mass and whether PC-OxPLs exert their anti-osteogenic effects via activation of Scarb1 in macrophages. To this end, we generated mice with deletion of Scarb1 in LysM-Cre expressing cells and found that lack of Scarb1 did not affect bone mass in vivo. These results indicate that Scarb1 expression in cells of the myeloid/osteoclast lineage does not contribute to bone homeostasis. Based on this evidence, and earlier studies of ours showing that Scarb1 expression in osteoblasts does not affect bone mass, we conclude that Scarb1 is not an important mediator of the adverse effects on PC-OxPLs in osteoclasts or osteoblasts in 6-month-old mice.

"Abstract
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a rich history spanning thousands of years, with its applications ranging from treating female infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss to managing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Yet the safety of pregnant women consuming Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) still lacks sufficient modern clinical research data. On April 19, the journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica published a research article titled ""Maternal traditional Chinese medicine exposure and risk of congenital malformations: a multi-center prospective cohort study."" The study claimed that ""Periconceptional TCM exposure is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation,"" drawing attention from both English and Chinese media outlets, which extensively reported and commented on the findings.
In response, various TCM organizations contested the research, asserting that it failed to adhere to fundamental standards of academic rigor, statistical analysis, and necessary methodologies to draw conclusions. International TCM practitioners and scholars thoroughly examined the article, uncovering multiple errors and arguing that these misleading conclusions significantly undermined the reputation of CHM. These scholars communicated their doubts directly to the corresponding author and the journal's chief editor, emphasizing that the article's conclusion was derived from secondary data analysis of another clinical research project and funding sources, therefore, called for withdrawal of the article. Eventually, the article was retracted due to flaws with the study design in collecting data on exposure to TCM in pregnant women, which affects the validity of the data to support the conclusions of the study.
This article conducts a comprehensive academic inquiry into the article, meticulously outlining the identified errors, discusses the reproductive toxicity of CHM, and provides suggestions for future research to evaluate the safety of pregnant women using CHM rigorously, emphasizing evaluation on teratogenicity research of CHM should not only be based on study using healthy animals, but also incorporate clinical epidemiological research and disease-syndrome-based toxicology.",1
"Abstract
Glucagon has been defined as an ‘insulin counteracting hormone’, which raises blood glucose levels. Recent progress in basic research has shown that glucagon is closely involved in glucose and amino acid metabolism. Additionally, its secretion is intricately, but precisely, regulated by various mechanisms involving molecules in addition to glucose, thus showing its critical role in systemic nutrient metabolism. An innovative dual-antibody-linked immunosorbent assay for glucagon that improves measurement accuracy has been developed, and substantial clinical findings have been obtained using this new system. This discovery expanded the pathophysiological significance of glucagon and accelerated the development of its clinical applications in diabetes.",1

(1) Background: Among all possible causes, foreign bodies are the rarest cause of appendicitis in the pediatric population. In the majority of cases, ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing symptoms. However, those foreign bodies that pass through the lumen of the vermiform appendix cannot re-enter the colon and may cause acute appendicitis. So far, various foreign bodies have been described to enter the appendix and cause acute appendicitis, such as seeds, needles, toothpicks, plant material, or even hair. Tooth or dental implants as a cause of acute appendicitis have been described in only a few cases. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of the tooth causing acute appendicitis in the pediatric population. (2) Case presentation: A 14-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and vomiting that persisted for approximately 24 h. Until then, the patient was healthy and had no concomitant diseases. Physical examination revealed guarding and tenderness in the right lower abdominal quadrant. The white blood cell count was 17.1 × 109/L with a neutrophil count of 91.1% and a C-reactive protein of 39.3 mg/dL. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a thickened, inflamed appendix with a diameter of 11 mm and free periappendicular fluid. A 9 × 6 mm foreign body at the base of the appendix was visualized. The patient was diagnosed with acute appendicitis, and an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy was performed on the same day. Intraoperatively, gangrenous appendicitis was noted and removed without complications. Upon examination of the removed specimen, it was determined that the patient’s appendicitis had been caused by an ingested tooth. As it later turned out, the patient had broken a lateral incisor while playing sports the day before admission without knowing that he had swallowed it. The patient recovered well and was discharged the day after surgery. (3) Conclusion: Although an extremely rare event, acute appendicitis can be caused by a swallowed tooth. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history in pediatric patients who present to the emergency department with suspected acute appendicitis to determine if there is a precipitating event that may have caused acute appendicitis.",1
"Abstract
In silico design of single guide RNA (sgRNA) plays a critical role in clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. Continuous efforts are aimed at improving sgRNA design with efficient on-target activity and reduced off-target mutations. In the last 5 years, an increasing number of deep learning-based methods have achieved breakthrough performance in predicting sgRNA on- and off-target activities. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to systematically evaluate these methods for their predictive abilities. In this review, we conducted a systematic survey on the progress in prediction of on- and off-target editing. We investigated the performances of 10 mainstream deep learning-based on-target predictors using nine public datasets with different sample sizes. We found that in most scenarios, these methods showed superior predictive power on large- and medium-scale datasets than on small-scale datasets. In addition, we performed unbiased experiments to provide in-depth comparison of eight representative approaches for off-target prediction on 12 publicly available datasets with various imbalanced ratios of positive/negative samples. Most methods showed excellent performance on balanced datasets but have much room for improvement on moderate- and severe-imbalanced datasets. This study provides comprehensive perspectives on CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA on- and off-target activity prediction and improvement for method development.",1
"Abstract
As a classical model system of embryo biology, the chicken embryo has been
used to investigate embryonic development and differentiation. Delivering exogenous
materials into chicken embryos has a great advantage for studying gene function,
transgenic breeding, and chimera preparation during embryonic development. Here
we show the method of in ovo intravascular injection whereby exogenous materials
such as plasmid vectors or modified primordial germ cells (PGCs) can be transferred
into donor chicken embryos at early developmental stages. The results show that the
intravascular injection through the dorsal aorta and head allows injected materials to
diffuse into the whole embryo through the blood circulatory system. In the presented
protocol, the efficacy of exogenous plasmid and lentiviral vector introduction, and the
colonization of injected exogenous PGCs in the recipient gonad, were determined
by observing fluorescence in the embryos. This article describes detailed procedures
of this method, thereby providing an excellent approach to studying gene function,
embryo and developmental biology, and gonad-chimeric chicken production. In
conclusion, this article will allow researchers to perform in ovo intravascular injection
of exogenous materials into chicken embryos with great success and reproducibility",1

The first law of thermodynamics reveals that all fluids are compressible, and the second law of thermodynamics entails all fluids to have
positive viscosity. These established laws reaffirm the possibilities of the occurrence of Sanal flow choking in yocto to yotta scale systems and
beyond [Kumar et al., “Discovery of nanoscale Sanal flow choking in cardiovascular system: Exact prediction of the 3D boundary-layerblockage factor in nanotubes,” Sci. Rep. 11, 15429 (2021); “Sanal flow choking: A paradigm shift in computational fluid dynamics code
verification and diagnosing detonation and hemorrhage in real-world fluid-flow systems,” Global Challenges 4, 2000012 (2020)]. The Sanal
flow choking occurs in the real-world flows at a critical total-to-static pressure ratio [Kumar et al., “Abstract P422: Sanal flow choking leads
to hemorrhagic stroke and other neurological disorders in earth and human spaceflight,” Circul. Res. 129(1), AP422 (2021)]. At the Sanal
flow choking condition, the Rayleigh-flow-effect (thermal choking) and the Fanno-flow-effect (choking due to frictional effects) unite at a
unique site of the sonic-fluid-throat. In this article, the two-dimensional (2D) and the three-dimensional (3D) boundary-layer-blockage
factors and average friction coefficient are generated for different working fluids passing through a cylindrical port, at the Sanal flow choking
condition, as universal benchmark data for a credible verification of in silico codes for both adiabatic and diabatic flows. The outlook,
advancement, and significance of the analytical methodology, invoked for developing Sanal flow choking model using well-posed initial
conditions, for generating the universal benchmark data for computational fluid dynamics code verification are critically reviewed herein.
The closed-form analytical models presented herein for predicting the 2D and the 3D boundary-layer-blockage factors at the sonic-fluidthroat of adiabatic and diabatic flows and average friction coefficient in a circular duct at the Sanal flow choking condition are fabulously
unaffected with any errors due to discretization and fully freed from empiricism for a credible decision making on various high fidelity
numerical simulations. The Sanal flow choking model offers the luxury to the scientific community for solving numerous unresolved
problems in boundary layer theory. It provides universal benchmark data for various applications irrespective of the laminar/turbulence flow
features in wall-bounded compressible viscous flow systems. The 2D and 3D in silico simulation results are presented for demonstrating

The relationship between depression and dementia is complex and still not well understood. A number of different views exist regarding how the two conditions are linked as well as the underlying
neurobiological mechanisms at work.
This narrative review examined longitudinal and cross sectional studies in the existing literature and
determined the evidence supporting depression being a risk factor, a prodrome, a consequence, or an
independent comorbidity in dementia.
Overall there is convincing evidence to support both the notion that early life depression can act as a
risk factor for later life dementia, and that later life depression can be seen as a prodrome to dementia.
There is also evidence to support both conditions showing similar neurobiological changes, particularly
white matter disease, either indicating shared risk factors or a shared pattern of neuronal damage.
These findings highlight the need to examine if effective treatment of depressive episodes has any
effect in reducing the prevalence of dementia, as well as clinicians being vigilant for late life depression
indicating the incipient development of dementia, and therefore carefully following up these individuals
for future cognitive impairment.",1

Developing a vaccine against Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, remains a public health priority. Syphilis vaccine design efforts have been complicated by lack of an in vitro T. pallidum culture system, prolific antigenic variation in outer membrane protein TprK, and lack of functional annotation for nearly half of the genes. Understanding the genetic basis of T. pallidum reinfection can provide insights into variation among strains that escape cross-protective immunity. Here, we present comparative genomic sequencing and deep, full-length tprK profiling of two T. pallidum isolates from blood from the same patient that were collected six years apart. Notably, this patient was diagnosed with syphilis four times, with two of these episodes meeting the definition of neurosyphilis, during this interval. Outside of the highly variable tprK gene, we identified 14 coding changes in 13 genes. Nine of these genes putatively localized to the periplasmic or outer membrane spaces, consistent with a potential role in serological immunoevasion. Using a newly developed full-length tprK deep sequencing protocol, we profiled the diversity of this gene that far outpaces the rest of the genome. Intriguingly, we found that the reinfecting isolate demonstrated less diversity across each tprK variable region compared to the isolate from the first infection. Notably, the two isolates did not share any full-length TprK sequences. Our results are consistent with an immunodominant-evasion model in which the diversity of TprK explains the ability of T. pallidum to successfully reinfect individuals, even when they have been infected with the organism multiple times.",1

The occurrence of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) can significantly affect the safety of a patient, and thus assessing DDI risk is important. Recently, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has been increasingly used to predict DDI potential. Here, we present a PBPK modeling concept and strategy. We also surveyed PBPK-related articles about the prediction of DDI potential in humans published up to October 10, 2017. We identified 107 articles, including 105 drugs that fit our criteria, with a gradual increase in the number of articles per year. Studies on antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs (26.7%) contributed the most to published PBPK models, followed by cardiovascular (20.0%) and anti-infective (17.1%) drugs. Models for specific products such as herbal products, therapeutic protein drugs, and antibody–drug conjugates were also described. Most PBPK models were used to simulate cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated DDIs (74 drugs, of which 85.1% were CYP3A4-mediated), whereas some focused on transporter-mediated DDIs (15 drugs) or a combination of CYP and transporter-mediated DDIs (16 drugs). Full PBPK, first-order absorption modules and Simcyp® software were predominantly used for modeling. Recently, DDI predictions associated with genetic polymorphisms, special populations, or both have increased. The 107 published articles reasonably predicted the DDI potentials, but further studies of physiological properties and harmonization of in vitro experimental designs are required to extend the application scope, and improvement of DDI predictions using PBPK modeling will be possible in the future.

Synthesizing evidence to examine changes in suicide-related outcomes before and during the pandemic can inform suicide management during the COVID-19 crisis. We searched 13 databases as of December 2022 for studies reporting both the pre- and peri-pandemic prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or rate of death by suicide. A random-effects model was used to pool the ratio of peri- and pre-pandemic prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt (Prevalence Ratio—PR) and rate of death by suicide (Rate Ratio; RR). We identified 51, 55, and 25 samples for suicidal ideation, attempt, and death by suicide. The prevalence of suicidal ideation increased significantly among non-clinical (PR = 1.142; 95% CI: 1.018–1.282; p = 0.024; k = 28) and clinical (PR = 1.134; 95% CI: 1.048–1.227; p = 0.002; k = 23) samples, and pooled estimates differed by population and study design. Suicide attempts were more prevalent during the pandemic among non-clinical (PR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.053–1.233; p = 0.001; k = 30) and clinical (PR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.17–1.489; p = 0.000; k = 25) participants. The pooled RR for death by suicide was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.84–1.01; p = 0.092; k = 25), indicating a nonsignificant downward trend. An upward trend of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite suicide rate remaining stable. Our findings suggest that timely prevention and intervention programs are highly needed for non-clinical adult population and clinical patients. Monitoring the real-time and long-run suicide risk as the pandemic evolves is warranted.

One of the prime aims of smart cities has been to optimally manage the available resources and systems that are used in the city. With an increase in urban population that is set to grow even faster in the future, smart city development has been the main goal for governments worldwide. In this regard, while the useage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques covering the areas of Machine and Deep Learning have garnered much attention for Smart Cities, less attention has focused towards the use of combinatorial optimization schemes. To help with this, the current review presents a coverage of optimization methods and applications from a smart city perspective enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT). A mapping is provided for the most encountered applications of computational optimization within IoT smart cities for five popular optimization methods, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony optimization and differential evolution. For each application identified, the algorithms used, objectives considered, the nature of the formulation and constraints taken in to account have been specified and discussed. Lastly, the data setup used by each covered work is also mentioned and directions for future work have been identified. This review will help researchers by providing them a consolidated starting point for research in the domain of smart city application optimization.

Abstract
Objective: 
In this analysis of the telehealth-based Vascular health ASsessment Of The hypertENSive patients Registry, we checked how 24-h central and peripheral hemodynamics compare with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD).

Methods: 
In 646 hypertensive patients (mean age 52 ± 16 years, 54% males, 65% treated) we obtained ambulatory brachial and central SBP and pulse pressure (PP), SBP, and PP variability, pulse wave velocity and augmentation index with a validated cuff-based technology. HMOD was defined by an increased left ventricular mass index (cardiac damage, evaluated in 482 patients), an increased intima–media thickness (vascular damage, n = 368), or a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate or increased urine albumin excretion (renal damage, n = 388).

Results: 
Ambulatory SBP and PPs were significantly associated with cardiac damage: the largest odds ratio was observed for 24-h central SBP [1.032 (1.012, 1.051), P = 0.001] and PP [1.042 (1.015, 1.069), P = 0.002], the weakest for brachial estimates. The association was less strong for vascular damage with a trend to the superiority of 24-h central [1.036 (0.997, 1.076), P = 0.070] over brachial PP [1.031 (1.000, 1.062), P = 0.052]. No statistically significant association was observed for renal damage. SBP and PP variabilities, pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were not associated with any form of HMOD. In the multivariate analysis, age was associated with any type of HMOD, whereas central SBP and PP were predictive of an increased risk of cardiac damage.

Conclusion: 
In hypertensive patients a variable association exists between peripheral and central hemodynamics and various types of HMOD, with the most predictive power being observed for central SBP and PP for cardiac damage.",1

Work stress can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by 50%, with increasing research
focusing on the underlying mechanisms responsible for these associations. Our meta-analysis
assessed the associations of the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) workplace stress model with
indices of cardiovascular disease. The search term ‘effort*reward*imbalance’ produced 22
papers (129 associations, N = 93,817) meeting inclusion criteria. Greater ERI was most
associated with increased hypertension (r = .26, p < .001, N = 1,180), intima media thickness
(r = .23, p <.001, N = 828) and fibrinogen (r = .13, p = .03, N = 4,315). Trait over-commitment
was most associated with increased hypertension (r = .24, p =.02, N = 899) and intima media
thickness (r = .19, p = .02, N = 828). Interventions aimed at reducing the impact of ERI and
over-commitment on cardiovascular disease should consider concurrently assessing changes in
physiological markers of cardiovascular disease.

Background:
Textbook knowledge and clinical dogma are often insufficient for effective evidence-based decision making when treating musculoskeletal injuries in American football players, given the variability in presentation and outcomes across different sports and different levels of competition. Key evidence can be drawn directly from high-quality published articles to make the appropriate decisions and recommendations for each athlete’s unique situation.
Purpose:
To identify and analyze the 50 most cited articles related to football-related musculoskeletal injury to provide an efficient tool in the arsenal of trainees, researchers, and evidence-based practitioners alike.
Study Design:
Cross-sectional study.
Methods:
The ISI Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were queried for articles pertaining to musculoskeletal injury in American football. For each of the top 50 most cited articles, bibliometric elements were evaluated: citation count and density, decade of publication, journal, country, multiple publications by the same first author or senior author, article content (topic, injury area), and level of evidence (LOE).
Results:
The mean ± SD number of citations was 102.76 ± 37.11; the most cited article, with 227 citations, was “Syndesmotic Ankle Sprains” published in 1991 by Boytim et al. Several authors served as a first or senior author on >1 publication, including J.S. Torg (n = 6), J.P. Bradley (n = 4), and J.W. Powell (n = 4). The American Journal of Sports Medicine published the majority of the 50 most cited articles (n = 31). A total of 29 articles discussed lower extremity injuries, while only 4 discussed upper extremity injuries. The majority of the articles (n = 28) had an LOE of 4, with only 1 article having an LOE of 1. The articles with an LOE of 3 had the highest mean citation number (133.67 ± 55.23; F = 4.02; P = .05).
Conclusion:
The results of this study highlight the need for more prospective research surrounding the management of football-related injury. The low overall number of articles on upper extremity injury (n = 4) also highlights an area for further research.",1

Background. In previous studies, electroacupuncture (EA) with 2/15 Hz has been shown to enhance the sedative effects in general anesthesia patients. Central lateral thalamic stimulation of 50 Hz showed an arousal effect in macaques. Therefore, it is worth studying the sedative effect of EA at peripheral acupoints with different frequencies, especially the frequency of around 50 Hz. Methods. Rats were anesthetized under the constant infusion of propofol and EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) locations. Electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate were continuously recorded before and after the intervention by EA in the C group (control), LEA group (low-frequency group, 2/15 Hz diffuse/dense wave EA stimulation), and HEA group (high-frequency group, 50 Hz stimulation). Results. In the LEA group, a significant increase in the power of the delta component with a decrease in the alpha component (p < 0.05) was observed after EA stimulation. In the HEA group, significant increases in the powers of alpha and beta components of EEG (p < 0.05) and a decrease in the delta component of EEG were observed (p < 0.05). The phenomenon is also shown in full-frequency waves. In addition, a significant decrease in the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio parameter was observed in the LEA group. Conclusions. EA at bilateral ST36 and PC6 can enhance the sedative effects of propofol anesthesia in low-frequency stimulation but lighten the sedative effects in high-frequency (50 Hz) stimulation. The sympathetic-vagal balance was affected due to low-frequency EA.",1

Purpose
Acupuncture has been recognized as an effective and safe alternative therapy for migraine, but its central mechanism has not yet been adequately explained. Meanwhile, research into the clinical efficacy and central mechanism of true acupuncture (TA) and sham acupuncture (SA) is lacking. It is necessary to investigate whether TA has better efficacy than SA, and how they achieve different effects. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of TA and SA, observe the brain response caused by TA and SA, and further investigate the central nervous mechanism of TA and SA treatment for patients with migraine.

Patients and Methods
This is a randomized controlled neuroimaging trial combining acupuncture treatment with functional magnetic resonance imaging, with patients and outcome assessors blinded. A total of 60 patients with migraine will be randomly allocated to receive 12 sessions of either TA or SA treatments (three sessions per week for 4 weeks), and 30 healthy participants will be recruited as the healthy control (HC) group. Outcome assessment and neuroimaging will be conducted before and after the entire intervention. A headache diary and questionnaires of life quality and psychological properties will be used to evaluate clinical efficacy. Multimodal magnetic resonance imagining data analysis will be used to investigate the central mechanism of TA or SA in treating migraine. Pearson’s correlation analysis will be used to reveal the relationship between the brain response and clinical improvements.

Conclusion
The results of this study will reveal the brain response to TA and SA in patients with migraine and contribute to further expanding the knowledge of their central mechanism.

"Abstract
Identifying modifiers of dosage-sensitive genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders is imperative to discover novel genetic risk factors and potential therapeutic entry points. In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1’s unusually long 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3′ and 5′ UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator that binds to a conserved site in ATXN1’s 5′ UTR to induce RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5′ UTR binding, and raise the possibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.

Alterations in protein folding and levels underlie the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and polyglutamine expansion disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of these diseases, in each case the misfolded proteins accumulate over time, eventually causing toxicity in the affected neurons (Katsnelson et al. 2016). Interestingly, neurons are also sensitive to elevated levels of wild-type (WT) protein. Duplications of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), as observed in individuals with Trisomy 21 or APP locus duplications, cause autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (Rumble et al. 1989; Rovelet-Lecrux et al. 2006; Sleegers et al. 2006), and both duplications and triplications of α-synuclein are associated with familial Parkinson's disease (Singleton et al. 2003; Chartier-Harlin et al. 2004). While it may be expected that such severe changes cause disease, even subtle increases in protein levels can be pathogenic. As such, slight increases in APP and α-synuclein caused by mutations in regulatory promoter and enhancer elements are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively (Theuns et al. 2006; Soldner et al. 2016).

An exemplar dosage-sensitive gene is Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), the causative gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) (Banfi et al. 1994; Zoghbi and Orr 1995). In SCA1, a CAG repeat expansion encoding the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in ATXN1 stabilizes the protein, resulting in a toxic gain-of-function mechanism in the cerebellum (Orr et al. 1993; Cummings et al. 1999; Fryer et al. 2011; Rousseaux et al. 2018a). Various strategies to lower ATXN1 levels were successful in reducing ATXN1's accumulation and mitigating cerebellar SCA1 pathogenesis (Park et al. 2013; Keiser et al. 2014; Friedrich et al. 2018). Furthermore, it was shown that slight increases in the levels of WT ATXN1, independent of the polyQ expansion, could also cause ataxia and motor coordination deficits in mice, two hallmarks of SCA1 (Gennarino et al. 2015). Conversely, decreasing ATXN1 levels in the hippocampus increases the levels of BACE1, also implicating ATXN1 levels as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (Suh et al. 2019). These studies highlight the importance of maintaining ATXN1 protein levels within an optimal range as perturbances in its levels may, over time, increase susceptibility to disease.

Given the importance of ATXN1 levels in disease, the regulation of ATXN1 expression has been of particular interest in hopes of identifying therapeutic strategies as well as disease risk factors. Previous studies found ATXN1’s 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) to be critical for ATXN1’s posttranscriptional regulation. MicroRNA 101 (miR101), as well as the RNA-binding protein PUMILIO1 (PUM1), interact with ATXN1’s 3′ UTR to negatively regulate ATXN1 expression (Lee et al. 2008; Gennarino et al. 2015). Subsequently, loss-of-function mutations in PUM1 were shown to cause ataxia in patients with previously unknown disease etiology, presumably, in part, by increasing WT ATXN1 (Gennarino et al. 2018).

While ATXN1’s regulation via its 3′ UTR has been extensively studied, not much is known about its regulation via the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR). 5′ UTRs are mainly known for their importance in translational regulation by dampening translation via upstream open reading frames and secondary structures (Mignone et al. 2002). Indeed, a recent study showed that ATXN1's 5′ UTR is involved in its translational control (Manek et al. 2019). Studies have also shown that 5′ UTRs can provide a platform for miRNAs to bind and regulate their target gene expression via a variety of other posttranscriptional mechanisms (Ørom et al. 2008; Moretti et al. 2010; Dewing et al. 2012; Zhou and Rigoutsos 2014). Importantly, genes that require fine regulation, such as growth factors, transcription factors, and proto-oncogenes have been shown to contain longer 5′ UTRs, providing more opportunity for regulation (Kozak 1987; Mignone et al. 2002).

As ATXN1’s 5′ UTR is exceptionally long with its exons spanning a genomic region of >433 kb (Banfi et al. 1994), we sought to investigate its role in regulating ATXN1 expression. We show that the 5′ UTR negatively regulates ATXN1 expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms and identify miR760 as a miRNA that interacts with a conserved binding site in ATXN1’s 5′ UTR to negatively regulate its expression through Argonaute 2 (AGO2)-mediated RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We further demonstrate that increasing miR760 expression in the cerebellum of a SCA1 mouse model reduces ATXN1 protein levels and ameliorates motor learning and coordination deficits. These findings highlight the importance of noncoding regions in regulating ATXN1 expression and raise the possibility that mutations in regulatory elements of ATXN1 may act as risk factors for non-CAG mediated ataxias.",1
"Abstract
The application of various sensors in hospitals has enabled the widespread utilization of multivariate time series signals for chronic disease diagnosis in the data-driven world. The key challenge is how to model the complex temporal (linear and nonlinear) correlations among multiple longitudinal variables. Due to scarcity of labels in practice, unsupervised learning methods have already become indispensable. However, state-of-the-art approaches mainly focus on the extraction of linear correlation-induced feature connectivity network, e.g., Pearson correlation, partial correlation, etc. To this end, for chronic disease (e.g., Parkinson disease) diagnosis, an unsupervised representation learning method is first designed to obtain informative correlation-aware signals from multivariate time series data. At the core is a contrastive learning framework with a graph neural network (GNN) encoder to capture the inter-correlation and intra-correlation of multiple longitudinal variables. Then, the previously learned representations are sent to a simple fully connected neural network, which can be trained using fewer labels compared with end-to-end complex supervised learning models. Further, to assist the decision-making process in the high-stake chronic disease detection task, model uncertainty quantification is enabled according to evidential theory. The experimental results on two public Parkinson’s disease data sets show the expressiveness of the learned embeddings, and the final lightweight classifier achieves the best performance.",1
"Abstract
Background: Various techniques can be used for the closure of the appendiceal stump in laparoscopic appendectomy, although no
consensus exists on the optimum approach.
Objectives: The present study was conducted to compare three different stump closure techniques in cases of complicated appendicitis.
Methods: A total of 172 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis were selected for conducting
the present retrospective cohort study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the appendiceal stump closure
technique: Hem-o-lok clips; extracorporeal knots which were pushed into the abdomen; and laparoscopic knots which were tied manually
within the abdomen. The three groups of patients were compared for demographic and clinical characteristics as well as follow-up data.
Results: A total of 85 patients were in Group 1, 43 patients in Group 2, and 44 patients in Group 3. The most common surgical finding was
a necrotic appendix in all three groups (67.1% vs. 81.4% vs. 68.2%; p: 0.448). The rate of drain use (42.4% vs. 34.9% vs. 31.8%; p: 0.455)
and the readmission rates (10.6% vs. 14% vs. 11.4%; p: 0.178) were also similar in all groups. The median postoperative hospital stay
was 2 days in all groups.
Conclusion: No superiority was identified in any of the approaches to stump closure for the laparoscopic treatment of complicated
appendicitis cases. All three techniques can be used safely. Accordingly, the technique should be selected based on the assessment of the
surgeon, patient’s characteristics, and cost",1
"Abstract
Background
For patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms, the preferred treatment is proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration for approximately 8 weeks. However, long-term use of PPIs can cause gut microbiome (GM) disturbances. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of probiotics combined with a PPI on the GM and gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Method
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 120 eligible patients with GERD will be randomized into the experimental group or the control group. The treatment includes two phases: the initial treatment period lasts 8 weeks (weeks 1–8), and the maintenance treatment period lasts 4 weeks (weeks 9–12). During the initial treatment period, the experimental group will take rabeprazole and LiHuo probiotics, and the control group will take rabeprazole and a probiotic placebo; during the maintenance treatment period, the experimental group will take LiHuo probiotics, and the control group will take a probiotic placebo. The primary measure is the change in the GM. The secondary measures are the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) score, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score, faecal metabolome (FM), body mass index, Los Angeles grade of oesophagitis, adverse event (AE) rate and treatment compliance. Each outcome indicator will be assessed at day 0 (before administration), day 28 and/or 56 (during administration), and day 84 (end of administration) to reveal intragroup differences. AEs will be monitored to assess the safety of LiHuo probiotics.

Discussion
This will be the first trial to use the intestinal flora metagene method to analyse the effects of probiotics on patients with GERD receiving long-term PPI treatment. The goal is to provide evidence for the use of probiotics to reduce intestinal flora disorders and other symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort in patients with GERD who have used PPIs for a long period.

"Abstract
Many factors in the domains of mental, physical, and social health have been associated with various ocular surface diseases, with most of the focus centered on aspects of dry eye disease (DED). Regarding mental health factors, several cross-sectional studies have noted associations between depression and anxiety, and medications used to treat these disorders, and DED symptoms. Sleep disorders (both involving quality and quantity of sleep) have also been associated with DED symptoms. Under the domain of physical health, several factors have been linked to meibomian gland abnormalities, including obesity and face mask wear. Cross-sectional studies have also linked chronic pain conditions, specifically migraine, chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, to DED, principally focusing on DED symptoms. A systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed available data and concluded that various chronic pain conditions increased the risk of DED (variably defined), with odds ratios ranging from 1.60 to 2.16. However, heterogeneity was noted, highlighting the need for additional studies examining the impact of chronic pain on DED signs and subtype (evaporative versus aqueous deficient). With respect to societal factors, tobacco use has been most closely linked to tear instability, cocaine to decreased corneal sensitivity, and alcohol to tear film disturbances and DED symptoms.",1
"Abstract
Acute liver injury (ALI) is a globally important public health issue that, when severe, rapidly progresses to acute liver failure, seriously compromising the life safety of patients. The pathogenesis of ALI is defined by massive cell death in the liver, which triggers a cascade of immune responses. Studies have shown that the aberrant activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an important role in various types of ALI and that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes various types of programmed cell death (PCD), and these cell death effectors can in turn regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inextricably linked to PCD. In this review, we summarize the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and PCD in various types of ALI (APAP, liver ischemia reperfusion, CCl4, alcohol, Con A, and LPS/D-GalN induced ALI) and analyze the underlying mechanisms to provide references for future relevant studies.

The purplish-red rod-like crystal structure of novel bimetallic metal–organic-frameworks (MOF) {CoZn[(4,4′-BDA)(Phen)]2}n has been obtained by the reaction of Co2+, Zn2+ (the molar ratio Co: Zn = 1:1), 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) and 4, 4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (4,4′-H2BDA), in which Zn ions of the previously reported monometallic MOF {[Zn(4,4′-BDA)(Phen)]2·(HCON(CH3)2}n are partly substituted by Co ions. The crystal structure of {CoZn[(4,4′-BDA)(Phen)]2}n has been characterized by IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Then, the precursors CoZn-MOF-B@C were obtained by adding a surfactant, activated carbon, and NaOH. Its derivative ZnO/CoO@C was used as anode material for lithium-ion batteries, which showed good lithium storage performance. The initial discharge specific capacity of ZnO/CoO@C is 1437.9 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, and after 100 cycles, the specific capacity drops to 741.8 mAh g−1.",1
"Abstract
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected the sleep health of healthcare workers (HCWs); however, no studies have assessed this effect in primary HCWs. This cross-sectional, web-based study explored the prevalence and factors associated with sleep disorders among primary HCWs during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai from 12 July to 15 August 2022. Sociodemographic and work-related characteristics, various sleep dimensions, and exposure to patients with COVID-19 were assessed. They were screened for common mental disorders (depression, burnout, and stress). Overall, 313 primary HCWs were recruited. At least one sleep dimension in 84% of respondents deteriorated compared with that observed pre-pandemic; sleep quality (decline of 66%) and daytime sleepiness (increase of 56%) were the most affected domains. After excluding 145 primary HCWs with pre-pandemic ‘poor sleep’, depression (odds ratio [OR] 3.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59–5.98), weekly burnout symptoms (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.32–5.03), and high psychological stress (OR 4.51; 95% CI 2.09–9.72) were associated with poor sleep patterns during the pandemic. After adjusting for significant differences between groups, for every 1-point increase in the Perceived Stress Scale score, an associated 12% increased risk of poor sleep (adjusted OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.05–1.21; p = 0.002) was observed. Most primary HCWs showed significant worsening of sleep quality, with increases in daytime sleepiness during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai. HCWs with high stress levels were at greater risks of sleep disorders.

"Abstract
Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% of all lung cancers. About 75% of patients are in the middle and advanced stages at the time of discovery, and the 5-year survival rate is very low. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NORAD in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. We found that lncRNA NORAD was highly expressed in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The CCK-8 assay results showed that lncRNA NORAD had no effect on cell proliferation. The Transwell assay and Western blotting results showed that overexpression of lncRNA NORAD promoted the invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cells. Then bioinformatics analysis was used to screen for candidate miRNA bound with lncRNA NORAD and the target gene of miRNA in NSCLC. The luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to verify the relationship. We found that miR-363-3p expression was down-regulated, whereas PEAK1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells. We performed gain and loss function test of lncRNA NORAD, miR-363-3p and PEAK1, the results showed that while miR-363-3p-mimic inhibited cell invasion and EMT by targeting PEAK1, lncRNA NORAD acted as a sponge of miR-363-3p and promoted cell invasion and EMT by increasing the expression of PEAK1. In addition, p-ERK expression was detected by Western blotting to observe the effects of lncRNA NORAD, miR-363-3p and PEAK1 on activation of the ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, lncRNA NORAD upregulated the expression of PEAK1 through sponging miR-363-3p, and then activated the ERK signaling pathway, thereby promoting the development of NSCLC.

"Abstract
Purpose:
Testosterone (T) administration prior to hypospadias surgery to increase glans size remains controversial. Understanding T’s effect on glans width (GW) is essential to understanding its potential impact on surgical outcomes. We hypothesized that preoperative T in prepubertal boys significantly increases GW at the time of hypospadias surgery.

Materials and Methods:
Our single institutional database was queried to identify patients who underwent hypospadias surgery from 2016 to 2020, in which data for T administration and GW were available. Descriptive, nonparametric and categorical statistics were performed as indicated.

Results:
A total of 579 patients were eligible for analysis. Median age at surgery was 0.9 years (IQR 0.6–1.6). A total of 247/579 patients (42.7%) received T. The median GW at surgery was 15 mm (IQR 13–17). When comparing patients who had T administered to those who did not, we found a significant difference in GW at surgery (16 mm vs 14 mm, p <0.001). The median change in GW from the office to surgery was 4 mm for those receiving T vs 0 mm for those not receiving T (p <0.001). We identified a greater change in GW from preoperative to intraoperative measurements in patients who received 2 doses of T vs 1 dose (4 mm vs 2 mm, p <0.001). A histogram plot revealed the distribution of GW change at surgery.

Conclusions:
In our prospectively collected cohort of patients undergoing hypospadias surgery, we were able to quantitate the change in GW from preoperative T. Two doses of T resulted in a significant increase in GW vs 1 dose.

"Abstract
Rationale: 
Osteosarcoma is a rare neoplasm in the lumbar spine. Although osteosarcoma can arise in any portion of the skeleton, it very rarely arises in the spinal canal, which accounts for <0.1% of all cases of adult sarcomas. Here, we describe a case of osteosarcoma arising in the L4–5 spinal canal.

Patient concerns: 
The present report describes the case of a 55-year-old female patient with osteosarcoma of the L4–5 spinal canal.

Diagnoses: 
The patient was initially diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and underwent lumbar fusion at a local hospital. At the 4-month follow-up, the patient reported a marked increase in numbness and pain in the lumbar region and lower limbs. Based on magnetic resonance imaging, we diagnosed a postoperative infectious lesion of the lumbar spine.

Interventions: 
The patient underwent surgery for complete removal of the mass lesion. The mass measured 3 × 2.5 × 0.7 cm3 in size and was located in the L4–5 spinal canal.

Outcomes: 
Based on histological and immunohistochemical findings, the diagnosis of osteosarcoma was confirmed by an expert pathology consultant. The patient then received chemotherapy. Postoperative follow-up at 6 months revealed no evidence of recurrent disease or residual side effects from therapy.

Lessons: 
Osteosarcoma in the L4–5 spinal canal is extremely rare and very difficult to distinguish histologically from benign nervous and fibrous tissue. This is a very valuable case, which highlights the need for orthopedic surgeons to consider this when diagnosing patients with spinal tumors.",1
"Abstract
It has been proven that the mechanical microenvironment can impact the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the effect of mechanical stimuli in biofabricating hydroxyapatite scaffolds on the inflammatory response of MSCs remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mechanical loading on the inflammatory response of MSCs seeded on scaffolds. Cyclic mechanical loading was applied to biofabricate the cell-scaffold composite for 15 min/day over 7, 14, or 21 days. At the predetermined time points, culture supernatant was collected for inflammatory mediator detection, and gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the expression of inflammatory mediators (IL1B and IL8) was downregulated (p < 0.05) and the expression of ALP (p < 0.01) and COL1A1 (p < 0.05) was upregulated under mechanical loading. The cell-scaffold composites biofabricated with or without mechanical loading were freeze-dried to prepare extracellular matrix-based scaffolds (ECM-based scaffolds). Murine macrophages were seeded on the ECM-based scaffolds to evaluate their polarization. The ECM-based scaffolds that were biofabricated with mechanical loading before freeze-drying enhanced the expression of M2 polarization-related biomarkers (Arginase 1 and Mrc1, p < 0.05) of macrophages in vitro and increased bone volume/total volume ratio in vivo. Overall, these findings demonstrated that mechanical loading could dually modulate the inflammatory responses and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Besides, the ECM-based scaffolds that were biofabricated with mechanical loading before freeze-drying facilitated the M2 polarization of macrophages in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. Mechanical loading may be a promising biofabrication strategy for bone biomaterials.",1

Objective
This study plans to investigate whether miR-214-3p could bind CPLX2 to regulate temozolomide (TMZ) resistance in glioma.

Methods
The differential expression of miR-214-3p and CPLX2 was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in TMZ-resistant glioma tissues. Then, TMZ-resistant glioma cells (U87/TMZ and U251/TMZ) were established and transfected with miR-214-3p mimic, miR-214-3p inhibitor, pcDNA3.1-CPLX2 or pcDNA3.1-CPLX2 plus miR-214-3p mimic to evaluate the impact of miR-214-3p and CPLX2 on the proliferation, apoptosis and TMZ resistance in U87/TMZ and U251/TMZ cells. The binding relationship between miR-214-3p and CPLX2 was reported by dual-luciferase reporter assay.

Results
Higher miR-214-3p and lower CPLX2 expression levels were revealed in TMZ-sensitive glioma tissues. The alterations in miR-214-3p and CPLX2 expression were more significant in TMZ-resistant tissues compared with TMZ-sensitive tissues. In cellular experiments, TMZ-resistant cells expressed higher miR-214-3p expression and lower CPLX2 expression than TMZ-sensitive cells. Transfection of miR-214-3p mimic elevated the proliferation and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and decreased the apoptosis in U87/TMZ and U251/TMZ cells. Introduction of miR-214-3p inhibitor or pcDNA3.1-CPLX2 reduced the proliferation and IC50 value and prompted the apoptosis in TMZ-resistant glioma cells. The effects of pcDNA3.1-CPLX2 on inhibiting the proliferation and IC50 value and enhancing the apoptosis in TMZ-resistant glioma cells were hindered by the transfection of miR-214-3p mimic. In addition, CPLX2 was a target gene of miR-214-3p.

Conclusion
Downregulation of miR-214-3p inhibits TMZ resistance in glioma by promoting CPLX2.",1
"Abstract
Microglial polarization and associated inflammatory activity are the key mediators of depression pathogenesis. The natural Smilax glabra rhizomilax derivative engeletin has been reported to exhibit robust anti-inflammatory activity, but no studies to date have examined the mechanisms through which it can treat depressive symptoms. We showed that treatment for 21 days with engeletin significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviours in chronic stress social defeat stress (CSDS) model mice. T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) imaging revealed no significant differences between groups, but the bilateral prefrontal cortex of CSDS mice exhibited significant increases in apparent diffusion coefficient and T2 values relative to normal control mice, with a corresponding reduction in fractional anisotropy, while engeletin reversed all of these changes. CSDS resulted in higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-a production, enhanced microglial activation, and greater M1 polarization with a concomitant decrease in M2 polarization in the mPFC, whereas engeletin treatment effectively abrogated these CSDS-related pathological changes. Engeletin was further found to suppress the LCN2/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) signalling axis such that adeno-associated virus-induced LCN2 overexpression ablated the antidepressant effects of engeletin and reversed its beneficial effects on the M1/M2 polarization of microglia. In conclusion, engeletin can alleviate CSDS-induced depressive-like behaviours by regulating the LCN2/CXCL10 pathway and thereby altering the polarization of microglia. These data suggest that the antidepressant effects of engeletin are correlated with the polarization of microglia, highlighting a potential avenue for future design of antidepressant strategies that specifically target the microglia.",1
"Abstract
Emerging evidence indicates that resistin and fascin-1 may possess a causal role in the development of several types of cancers. However, the clinical significance of resistin expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues is unclear, and there are no reports of any correlation between resistin and fascin-1. Our analyses explored the expression of resistin in CRC tissue and analyzed the clinical and prognostic significance of the observed positive correlation between resistin and fascin-1. The rate of strongly positive resistin expression (27.5%) was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in normal colorectal tissues (5.2%). Strongly positive resistin expression is related to multiple poor prognostic factors in CRC, including depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor stage. In this study, survival was worse in CRC patients with high levels of both resistin and fascin-1 expression than in those with high levels of only one protein or normal levels of both proteins. We suggest that a combined high level of resistin and fascin-1 expression correlates reliably with survival in CRC, so it may serve as a potential therapeutic target.",1

"Abstract
Injuries to fibrous connective tissues have very little capacity for self-renewal and exhibit poor healing after injury. Phenotypic shifts in macrophages play a vital role in mediating the healing response, creating an opportunity to design immunomodulatory biomaterials which control macrophage polarization and promote regeneration. In this study, electrospun poly(-caprolactone) fibers with increasing surface roughness (SR) were produced by increasing relative humidity and inducing vapor-induced phase separation during the electrospinning process. The impact of surface roughness on macrophage phenotype was assessed using human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro and in vivo using B6.Cg-Tg(Csf1r-EGFP)1Hume/J (MacGreen) mice. In vitro experiments showed that macrophages cultured on mesh with increasing SR exhibited decreased release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines potentially driven by increased protein adsorption and biophysical impacts on the cells. Further, increasing SR led to an increase in the expression of the pro-regenerative cell surface marker CD206 relative to the pro-inflammatory marker CD80. Mesh with increasing SR were implanted subcutaneously in MacGreen mice, again showing an increase in the ratio of cells expressing CD206 to those expressing CD80 visualized by immunofluorescence. SR on implanted biomaterials is sufficient to drive macrophage polarization, demonstrating a simple feature to include in biomaterial design to control innate immunity.",1

The aim of this study is to characterize the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED) and identify miRNA biomarkers of disease activity. Total RNA was isolated from the sera of patients with TED (n = 10) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 5) using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit. The NanoString assay was used for the comprehensive analysis of 798 miRNA expression profiles. Analysis of specific miRNA signatures, mRNA target pathway analysis, and network analysis were performed. Patients with TED were divided into two groups according to disease activity: active and inactive TED groups. Differentially expressed circulating miRNAs were identified and tested using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) tests in the validation cohort. Among the 798 miRNAs analyzed, 173 differentially downregulated miRNAs were identified in TED patients compared to those in the HCs. Ten circulating miRNAs were differentially expressed between the active and inactive TED groups and regarded as candidate biomarkers for TED activity (one upregulated miRNA: miR-29c-3p; nine downregulated miRNAs: miR-4286, miR-941, miR-571, miR-129-2-3p, miR-484, miR-192-5p, miR-502-3p, miR-597-5p, and miR-296-3p). In the validation cohort, miR-484 and miR-192-5p showed significantly lower expression in the active TED group than in the inactive TED group. In conclusion, the expression levels of miR-484 and miR-192-5p differed significantly between the active and inactive TED groups, suggesting that these miRNAs could serve as circulating biomarkers of TED activity, however, these findings need to be validated in further studies.",1
"Abstract
Disordered proliferation and angiogenesis of pulmonary artery endothelial cells is an important stage in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Recent studies revealed that GDF11 (growth differentiation factor 11) induces endothelial cells proliferation and migration; however, whether GDF11 is directly involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension remains unknown. Here, we found that GDF11 was significantly upregulated and activated in 2 experimental pulmonary arterial hypertension models and cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Genetic ablation of gdf11 in endothelial cells rescued pulmonary arterial hypertension features, as demonstrated by right ventricle hypertrophy, right ventricular systolic pressure, hemodynamics, cardiac function, and vascular remodeling. Moreover, we found that hypoxia significantly increased cell cycle progression, proliferation, migration, adhesion, and tube formation, which were significantly inhibited by GDF11 small interfering RNA. These events could be reproduced using cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells and were dependent on Smad signaling. Moreover, hypoxia-induced GDF11 expression was regulated by the transcription factor zinc finger protein 740, which assisted RNA polymerase in recognizing and binding to the GDF11 promoter sequence located at a site (−753/−744; CCCCCCCCAC) upstream of the gene. This study identified a novel growth and differentiation factor signaling pathway involved in the zinc finger protein 740/GDF11/transforming growth factor-β receptor I/Smad signaling axis and involved in pulmonary artery endothelial cells proliferation and angiogenesis. These results provide critical insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for pulmonary arterial hypertension involving components of the GDF11 signaling system.",1

Introduction: Echocardiography is a rapid, noninvasive, and complete cardiac assessment tool for
patients with hemodynamic instability. Relevant articles were extracted after searching on databases
by two reviewers and incorporated in this review in anarrative style.
Areas covered: his review provides an overview of the evidence for current practices in critical care
units (CCUs), incorporating the use of echocardiography in different etiologies of shock.
Expert opinion: In an acute scenario, a basic echocardiographic study yields prompt diagnosis,
allowing for the initiation of treatment. The most common pathologies in shocked patients are
identified promptly using two-dimensional (2D) and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive assessment can follow after patients have been stabilized. There are four types of shock: (i)
cardiogenic shock, (ii) hypovolemic shock, (iii) obstructive shock, and (iv) septic shock. All of them
can be readily identified by echocardiography. As echocardiography is increasingly being used in an
intensive care setting, its applications and evidence base should be expanded by randomized controlled trials to demonstrate patient outcomes in critical care.",1

Background:
Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disorder, is a major reason of disability in adults. Accumulating evidences have proved that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-carried exosomes play a significant therapeutic effect on OA. However, the precise regulatory network remains unknown.

Methods:
OA and normal cartilage samples were acquired from patients, and chondrocytes were exposed to IL-1β to conduct a cellular OA model. Exosomes prepared from BMSCs were identified using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell viability was determined with CCK-8 assay. Inflammatory injury was assessed by LDH and inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) using corresponding ELISA kits, respectively. Ferroptosis was evaluated by GSH, MDA and iron levels using corresponding kits, and ROS level with DCFH-DA. The expressions of genes/proteins were determined with RT-qPCR/western bolt. RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase activity assay were conducted for testing the interactions of small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7)/ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and miR-485-5p.

Results:
The expressions of SNHG7 and FSP1 were both reduced in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes and OA cartilage tissues, and there was a positive correlation between them in clinical level. Moreover, SNHG7 was enriched in BMSCs-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exos) and could be internalized by chondrocytes. Functional analysis illustrated that BMSCs-Exos administration repressed inflammatory injury, oxidative stress and ferroptosis in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes, while these changes were reinforced when SNHG7 was overexpressed in BMSCs-Exos. Notably, FSP1 silencing in chondrocytes abolished the beneficial effects mediated by exosomal SNHG7.

Conclusions:
Exosomal SNHG7 released from BMSCs inhibited inflammation and ferroptosis in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes through miR-485-5p/FSP1 axis. This work suggested that BMSCs-derived exosomal SNHG7 would be a prospective target for OA treatment.",1

Background
Increasing evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the occurrence and development of human cancers. LINC00460, a novel tumor-related lncRNA, has been reported to be involved in several types of human malignancies. However, the role of LINC00460 in gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear. The present study aimed at exploring the biological role of LINC00460 in GC and illuminating the potential molecular mechanisms.

Methods
In this study, qRT-PCR, western blotting, MTT assay, and Transwell invasion assay were used to conduct relevant experimental analysis.

Results
Here, we found that LINC00460 was highly expressed in GC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, LINC00460 overexpression was found to promote GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas LINC00460 down-regulation significantly inhibited these processes. Notably, we confirmed that LINC00460 could up-regulate KDM2A expression by competitively binding to miR-342-3p in GC cells. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of LINC00460 down-regulation on GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were partially reversed by a miR-342-3p inhibitor.

Conclusion
In summary, our findings provide evidence for LINC00460 as a potential therapeutic target in GC.",1
"Abstract
Cyanobacteria employ two-component sensor-response regulator systems to monitor and respond to environmental challenges. The response regulators RpaA, RpaB, Rre1 and RppA are integral to circadian clock function and abiotic stress acclimation in cyanobacteria. RpaA, RpaB and Rre1 are known to interact with ferredoxin or thioredoxin, raising the possibility of their thiol regulation. Here, we report that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Rre1, RpaA and RpaB exist as higher-order oligomers under oxidising conditions and that reduced thioredoxin A converts them to monomers. We further show that these response regulators contain redox-responsive cysteine residues with an Em7 around −300 mV. These findings suggest a direct thiol modulation of the activity of these response regulators, independent of their cognate sensor kinases.",1
"ABSTRACT
Soil adhesion is a physical phenomenon which results in undesirable effects including increment in
drag force and energy consumption of cutting or tillage tools. One method to reduce the soil adhesion is
biomimetics, i.e., focusing on the technique soil-burrowing animals’ benefit. In this study, three types of blade
were designed and built: flat blade, corrugated blade and a combination of flat and corrugated blades. The
corrugated blade was simulated from Armadillidium vulgare body surface geometrical shape. Experimental
results showed that in dry soil, flat and corrugated blades required similar drag force while the combined
blade showed higher drag force requirements. In wet soil, the corrugated blade resulted in the lowest drag
force, which was due to faster movement of soil layer on the blade surface. Drag force of the corrugated
blade was lower than the half of the drag force of two other blades at travel speed of 0.04 m/s. Besides, the
drag force of corrugated blade decreased by increasing the blade travel speed. Furthermore, in wet soil, the
energy consumption of the corrugated blade at the travel speeds of 0.02 and 0.04 m/s was 66% and 83%
lower than the flat blade, respectively.",1

Background
Sclerotium rolfsii is a soil-borne fungal pathogen causing diseases in more than 500 plant species. It causes southern blight disease in chili. Chemical fungicides are used to control this disease, which also pollute the environment. The present study was designed to assess the potential of two species of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) viz. Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas fluorescence, and an allelopathic weed, Anagallis arvensis L., for the control of southern blight disease of chili.

Results
Initially, three PGPR strains, viz. B. megaterium OSR3, B. megaterium ZMR6, and P. fluorescence PF-097, were selected for their in vitro antagonistic assessment against S. rolfsii by dual culture technique on potato dextrose agar medium. OSR3 showed the highest antagonistic potential (68%), followed by PF-097 (54%) and ZMR6 (33%). In a pot experiment, the two best strains of PGPR, namely OSR3 and PF-097, and dried biomass of A. arvensis (DBA) in different concentrations (1, 2 and 3%) were used to manage southern blight disease of chili. In positive control treatment (S. rolfsii only), plant survival was low (73%) than the negative control (100%). OSR3, PF-097, OSR3 + 2% DBA, and PF-097 + 2% DBA significantly enhanced plant survival over positive control. The highest increase in chili growth over positive control was recorded due to OSR3, followed by PF-097 inoculations. Contents of carotenoid and chlorophyll were significantly decreased due to the fungal pathogen and improved due to PGPR strains. Application of the two PGPR strains and different concentrations of A. arvensis distinctly increased the catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), and polyphenol peroxidase (PPO) activities over positive control.

Conclusions
The present study concluded that PGPR strains B. megaterium OSR3 and P. fluorescence PF-097 can control southern blight disease effectively and increase growth and yield of chili.",1

Objectives
Osteoblasts are derived from Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BM-MSCs), which play an indispensable role in bone formation. In this study, the authors aim to investigate the role of IRF4 in the osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs and its potential molecular mechanism.
Methods
The authors used lentivirus infection to overexpress IRF4 in BM-MSCs. The expression of IRF4 and osteogenesis-related genes were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. The osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs was evaluated by Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin red staining, and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) staining. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Dual-Luciferase reporter assay and RNA Immunoprecipitation Assay were applied to confirm the regulatory mechanism between IRF4, miR-636 and DOCK9.
Results
The authors found IRF4 was down-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs, and IRF4 overexpression could decrease the osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by specifically promoting the reduction of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity and down-regulating osteogenic indicators, including OCN, OPN, Runx2 and CollA1. Mechanistically, IRF4 activated microRNA-636 (miR-636) expression via binding to its promoter region, and Dedicator of Cytokinesis 9 (DOCK9) was identified as the target of miR-636 in BM-MSCs. Moreover, the damage in the capacity of osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs induced by IRF4 overexpression could be rescued by miR-636 inhibition.
Conclusions
In summary, this paper proposed that IRF4/miR-636/DOCK9 may be considered as targets for the treatment of osteoporosis (OP).",1
"Abstract
The pre-hospital supply chain plays a fundamental role in responding to emergencies,
ensuring the effective supply of critical resources such as medical equipment and essential
goods to healthcare facilities, emergency services, as well as individuals. To achieve this,
advance and anticipatory preparation is essential for an effective and efficient response,
ensuring that any adversities encountered do not significantly hinder the normal functioning of
the pre-hospital supply chain.
This study delved into the analysis of the challenges faced by the pre-hospital supply
chain in Portugal during the pandemic period, particularly in the preparation phase, with a focus
on masks as a central research component. The research involved semi-structured interviews
with professionals and experts in logistics and emergency management, along with a detailed
analysis of academic, research, and legislative documents. These sources revealed certain
problems that indicated some inefficiencies within the logistical system.
Through interviews conducted with field experts, it became evident that the lack of a
robust strategic planning approach was a critical weakness in the pre-existing management of
the supply chain. Specifically, the absence of defined minimum stock quantities and nationallevel inventory proved to be significant obstacles. It is worth noting that financing should be a
crucial consideration, as it serves as the foundation for the smooth and effective functioning of
the entire pre-hospital supply chain. Bureaucracy emerged as a significant impediment in this
context. Other highlighted issues included the absence of a detailed description of suppliers and
an excessive international dependency for certain goods.
In the discussion of the results, various authors emphasized the vital importance of a
holistic and adaptable approach to pre-hospital supply chain management. This encompassed
the need for more meticulous strategic planning, including the precise definition of essential
goods, the establishment of a rigorous inventory system, the formalization of clear and concise
agreements with suppliers, and the promotion of national self-sufficiency.
The results obtained through this research underscore the intrinsic relevance of
effective pre-hospital supply chain management, especially during crises such as the COVID19 pandemic. Lastly, it highlights the urgency of using past mistakes as constructive lessons to
strengthen Portugal's future preparedness and response in similar scenarios.

"Abstract
Atherogenesis is a chronic inflammatory process, closely related to high morbidity and mortality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) were reported to function in atherosclerosis. However, the functional impact of circRNA ubiquitin-specific Protease 36 (circ_USP36) on atherosclerosis and the possible mechanism are still unclear. Serum specimens were collected from atherosclerosis patients and healthy volunteers. Human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs) exposed with 25 μg/mL oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were utilized to simulate atherosclerosis. Expression of circ_USP36, microRNA (miR)-182-5p and Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) was determined via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot assay. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry. Cell metastasis, including migration and invasion, was assessed via Transwell assay. Biomarker protein was analyzed by western blot. The relationship among circ_USP36, miR-182-5p and KLF5 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. Circ_USP36 and KLF5 were up-regulated, while miR-182-5p was down-regulated in atherosclerosis patients and ox-LDL-induced HUVSMCs. Circ_USP36 knockdown inhibited proliferation and metastasis of ox-LDL-induced HUVSMCs by up-regulating miR-182-5p. MiR-182-5p targeted KLF5, and ameliorated ox-LDL-mediated injury of HUVSMCs. Circ_USP36 knockdown down-regulated KLF5 expression by sponging miR-182-5p. Knockdown of circ_USP36 alleviated ox-LDL-mediated injury of HUVSMCs by modulating miR-182-5p/KLF5 axis, potentially providing a treatment target for atherosclerosis.

"Exosomes and exosome-like vesicles participate in cell-to-cell communication in animals, plant, and bacteria. Dietary exosomes in bovine milk are bioavailable in nonbovine species, but a fraction of milk exosomes reaches the large intestine. We hypothesized that milk exosomes alter the composition of the gut microbiome in mice. C57BL/6 mice were fed AIN-93G diets, defined by their content of bovine milk exosomes and RNA cargos: exosome/RNA-depleted (ERD) versus exosome/RNA-sufficient (ERS) diets. Feeding was initiated at age 3 wk, and cecum content was collected at ages 7, 15, and 47 wk. Microbial communities were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Milk exosomes altered bacterial communities in the murine cecum. The abundance of three phyla, seven families, and 52 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was different in the ceca from mice fed ERD and ERS (P < 0.05). For example, at the phylum level, Tenericutes had more than threefold abundance in ERS mice at ages 15 and 47 wk compared with ERD mice (P < 0.05). At the family level, Verrucomicrobiaceae were much less abundant in ERS mice compared with ERD mice age 47 wk (P < 0.05). At the OTU level, four OTUs from the family of Lachnospiraceae were more than two times more abundant in ERS mice compared with ERD at age 7 and 47 wk (P < 0.05). We conclude that exosomes in bovine milk alter microbial communities in nonbovine species, suggesting that exosomes and their cargos participate in the crosstalk between bacterial and animal kingdoms.",1
"Abstract
Background: Chemotherapeutic resistance of glioblastoma has been attributed to a self-renewing subpopulation, the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which is known to be maintained by the Wnt β−catenin pathway. Our previous findings demonstrated that exogeneous addition of the Wnt antagonist, secreted fizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) hampered stem cell properties in GSCs. Methods: To understand the molecular mechanism of sFRP4, we overexpressed sFRP4 (sFRP4 OE) in three human glioblastoma cell lines U87MG, U138MG, and U373MG. We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of sFRP4 OE and RNA sequencing of sFRP4 OE and sFRP4 knocked down U87 cells. Results: We observed nuclear localization of sFRP4, suggesting an unknown nuclear role. ChIP-sequencing of sFRP4 pulldown DNA revealed a homeobox Cphx1, related to the senescence regulator ETS proto-oncogene 2 (ETS2). Furthermore, miRNA885, a p53-mediated apoptosis inducer, was upregulated in sFRP4 OE cells. RNA sequencing analysis suggested that sFRP4-mediated apoptosis is via the Fas-p53 pathway by activating the Wnt calcium and reactive oxygen species pathways. Interestingly, sFRP4 OE cells had decreased stemness, but when knocked down in multipotent mesenchymal stem cells, pluripotentiality was induced and the Wnt β-catenin pathway was upregulated. Conclusions: This study unveils a novel nuclear role for sFRP4 to promote apoptosis by a possible activation of DNA damage machinery in glioblastoma.",1
"Abstract
The incidence of preterm birth (PTB) is increasing annually worldwide, leading to various health problems or even fetal deaths. Our previous work demonstrated the activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C 3 (TRPC3) in mice with PTB, and its activation could promote inward flow of calcium ions and uterine smooth muscle (USM) contraction via regulation of Cav3.2, Cav3.1, and Cav1.2. However, the upstream regulators of TRPC3 and its mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, the binding of miR-26a-5p to the 3′ untranslated region of TRPC3 was predicted by bioinformatics databases (TargetScanHuman and starBase v3.0) and confirmed by a dual-luciferase assay. MiR-26a-5p was downregulated, while TRPC3 was upregulated in the USM tissues of patients with PTB compared to people without PTB. The results showed that miR-26a-5p mimic transfection markedly reduced TRPC3 expression in LPS-stimulated USM cells. Additionally, miR-26a-5p regulated intracellular Ca2+ levels in USM cells by targeting TRPC3. Furthermore, miR-26a-5p inhibited the CPI17/PKC/PLCγ signaling pathway and reduced the expression of Cav3.2, Cav3.1, and Cav1.2. In conclusion, miR-26a-5p regulated the initiation of PTB by targeting TRPC3 and regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels. This study provides a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PTB.",1

Purpose
Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency may increase the susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to determine the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and susceptibility to COVID-19, its severity, mortality, and role of vitamin D in its treatment.

Methods
We searched CINAHL, Cochrane library, EMBASE, PubMED, Scopus, and Web of Science up to May 30, 2021, for observational studies on association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and susceptibility to COVID-19, severe disease, and death among adults, and, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamin D treatment against standard care or placebo, in improving severity or mortality among adults with COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies and AUB-KQ1 Cochrane tool for RCTs. Study-level data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 and R (v4.1.0). Heterogeneity was determined by I2 and sources were explored through prespecified sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regressions.

Results
Of 1877 search results, 76 studies satisfying eligibility criteria were included. Seventy-two observational studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1 976 099). Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency increased the odds of developing COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.46; 95% CI, 1.28-1.65; P < 0.0001; I2 = 92%), severe disease (OR 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52-2.38; P < 0.0001; I2 = 81%), and death (OR 2.07; 95% CI, 1.28-3.35; P = 0.003; I2 = 73%). The 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations were lower in individuals with COVID-19 compared with controls (mean difference [MD] -3.85 ng/mL; 95% CI, -5.44 to -2.26; P ≤ 0.0001), in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls with nonsevere COVID-19 (MD -4.84 ng/mL; 95% CI, -7.32 to -2.35; P = 0.0001) and in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (MD -4.80 ng/mL; 95% CI, -7.89 to -1.71; P = 0.002). The association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and death was insignificant when studies with high risk of bias or studies reporting unadjusted effect estimates were excluded. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were high across all analyses. Discrepancies in timing of vitamin D testing, definitions of severe COVID-19, and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency partly explained the heterogeneity. Four RCTs were widely heterogeneous precluding meta-analysis.

Conclusion
Multiple observational studies involving nearly 2 million adults suggest vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency increases susceptibility to COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, although with a high risk of bias and heterogeneity. Association with mortality was less robust. Heterogeneity in RCTs precluded their meta-analysis.",1

Purpose
With the escalating social pressures, there has been a continuous rise in the prevalence of depression among the population, leading to substantial healthcare burdens. Moreover, conventional pharmacological interventions still exhibit certain limitations. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of depression.

Methods
Randomized controlled trials of probiotics in treating depressive symptoms were retrieved from Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wan Fang database, and CNKI between the establishment of the database and March 2022. The primary outcome was Beck’s depression rating scale (BDI) scores, while the secondary outcomes were depression scores on the DASS-21 scale, biochemical indicators (IL-6, NO, and TNF-α levels), and adverse events. In addition, Revman 5.3 was used for Meta-analysis and quality evaluation, and Stata 17 was used for the Egger test and Begg’s test. A total of 776 patients, including 397 and 379 patients in the experimental and control groups, respectively, were included.

Results
The total BDI score of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (MD = − 1.98, 95%CI − 3.14 to − 0.82), and the score of DASS (MD = 0.90, 95%CI − 1.17 to 2.98), the IL-6 level (SMD = − 0.55, 95%CI − 0.88 to − 0.23), the NO level (MD = 5.27, 95% CI 2.51 to 8.03), and the TNF-α level (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI − 0.25 to 0.63).

Conclusion
The findings substantiate the therapeutic potential of probiotics in mitigating depressive symptoms by significantly reducing Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and alleviating the overall manifestation of depression.",1

Importance  Understanding the effect of antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) treatment on functional connectivity will help elucidate the mechanism by which it reduces the risk of cerebral palsy and death.

Objective  To determine whether MgSO4 administered to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks is associated with increased functional connectivity and measures of functional segregation and integration in infants at term-equivalent age, possibly reflecting a protective mechanism of MgSO4.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study was nested within a randomized placebo-controlled trial performed across 24 tertiary maternity hospitals. Participants included infants born to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks who participated in the MAGENTA (Magnesium Sulphate at 30 to 34 Weeks’ Gestational Age) trial and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. Ineligibility criteria included illness precluding MRI, congenital or genetic disorders likely to affect brain structure, and living more than 1 hour from the MRI center. One hundred and fourteen of 159 eligible infants were excluded due to incomplete or motion-corrupted MRI. Recruitment occurred between October 22, 2014, and October 25, 2017. Participants were followed up to 2 years of age. Analysis was performed from February 1, 2021, to February 27, 2024. Observers were blind to patient groupings during data collection and processing.

Exposures  Women received 4 g of MgSO4 or isotonic sodium chloride solution given intravenously over 30 minutes.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Prior to data collection, it was hypothesized that infants who were exposed to MgSO4 would show enhanced functional connectivity compared with infants who were not exposed.

Results  A total of 45 infants were included in the analysis: 24 receiving MgSO4 treatment and 21 receiving placebo; 23 (51.1%) were female and 22 (48.9%) were male; and the median gestational age at scan was 40.0 (IQR, 39.1-41.1) weeks. Treatment with MgSO4 was associated with greater voxelwise functional connectivity in the temporal and occipital lobes and deep gray matter structures and with significantly greater clustering coefficients (Hedge g, 0.47 [95% CI, −0.13 to 1.07]), transitivity (Hedge g, 0.51 [95% CI, −0.10 to 1.11]), local efficiency (Hedge g, 0.40 [95% CI, −0.20 to 0.99]), and global efficiency (Hedge g, 0.31 [95% CI, −0.29 to 0.90]), representing enhanced functional segregation and integration.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study, infants exposed to MgSO4 had greater voxelwise functional connectivity and functional segregation, consistent with increased brain maturation. Enhanced functional connectivity is a possible mechanism by which MgSO4 protects against cerebral palsy and death.",1

Background
Emotional eating in bariatric surgery patients is inconsistently linked with poor post-operative weight loss and eating behaviors, and much research to date is atheoretical. To examine theory-informed correlates of pre-operative emotional eating, the present cross-sectional analysis examined paths through which experienced weight bias and internalized weight bias (IWB) may associate with emotional eating among individuals seeking bariatric surgery.

Methods
We examined associations of experienced weight bias, IWB, shame, self-compassion, and emotional eating in patients from a surgical weight loss clinic (N = 229, 82.1% female, M. BMI: 48 ± 9). Participants completed a survey of validated self-report measures that were linked to BMI from the patient medical record. Multiple regression models tested associations between study constructs while PROCESS bootstrapping estimates tested the following hypothesized mediation model: IWB ➔ internalized shame ➔ self-compassion ➔ emotional eating. Primary analyses controlled for adverse childhood experiences (ACE), a common confound in weight bias research. Secondary analyses controlled for depressive/anxiety symptoms from the patient medical record (n = 196).

Results
After covariates and ACE, each construct accounted for significant unique variance in emotional eating. However, experienced weight bias was no longer significant and internalized shame marginal, after controlling for depressive/anxiety symptoms. In a mediation model, IWB was linked to greater emotional eating through heightened internalized shame and low self-compassion, including after controlling for depressive/anxiety symptoms.

Conclusions
Pre-bariatric surgery, IWB may signal risk of emotional eating, with potential implications for post-operative trajectories. Self-compassion may be a useful treatment target to reduce IWB, internalized shame, and related emotional eating in bariatric surgery patients. Further longitudinal research is needed.",1
"Abstract
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in livestock fecundity, and many lncRNAs that affect follicular development and reproductive diseases have been identified in the ovary. However, only a few of them have been functionally annotated and mechanistically validated. In this study, we identified a new lncRNA (lncGSAR) and investigated its effects on the proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovine granulosa cells (GCs). High concentrations of glucose (add 33.6 mM glucose) caused high expression of lncGSAR in GCs by regulating its stability, and lncGSAR overexpression promoted GCs proliferation, estrogen secretion, and inhibited progesterone secretion, whereas interference with lncGASR had the opposite effect. Next, we found that the RNA molecules of lncGSAR act on MiR-125b as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), and SREBP-cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) was verified as a target of MiR-125b. LncGASR overexpression increased the expression of SCAP, SREBP, and steroid hormone-related proteins, which can be attenuated by MiR-125b. Our results demonstrated that lncGSAR can act as a ceRNA to activate SCAP/SREBP signaling by sponging MiR-125b to regulate steroid hormone secretion in GCs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of nutrient-regulated follicle development in ewes.

"Abstract
One-third of humanity harbors a lifelong infection with Toxoplasma gondii, and probably about 80% are infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV). This study aims to delineate the associations between toxoplasmosis and cognitive abilities and compare these to the associations with CMV. We evaluated the cognitive performance of 557 students, who had been examined for Toxoplasma and CMV infections, using intelligence, memory, and psychomotor tests. The results indicated cognitive impairments in seropositive individuals for both pathogens, with variations in cognitive impact related to sex and the Rh factor. Specifically, Toxoplasma infection was associated with lower IQ in men, whereas CMV was predominantly associated with worse performance by women when testing memory and reaction speeds. Analysis of the antibody concentrations indicated that certain Toxoplasma-associated cognitive detrimental effects may wane (impaired intelligence) or worsen (impaired reaction times) over time following infection. The findings imply that the cognitive impairments caused by both neurotropic pathogens are likely due to pathological changes in the brain rather than from direct manipulative action by the parasites.

"Abstract
Currently, the treatment for sepsis-induced acute lung injury mainly involves mechanical ventilation with limited use of drugs, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic options. As a pivotal aspect of acute lung injury, the pathologic activation and apoptosis of endothelial cells related to oxidative stress play a crucial role in disease progression, with NOX4 and Nrf2 being important targets in regulating ROS production and clearance. Echinacoside, extracted from the traditional Chinese herbal plant Cistanche deserticola, possesses diverse biological activities. However, its role in sepsis-induced acute lung injury remains unexplored. Moreover, although some studies have demonstrated the regulation of NOX4 expression by SIRT1, the specific mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of echinacoside on sepsis-induced acute lung injury and oxidative stress in mice and to explore the intricate regulatory mechanism of SIRT1 on NOX4. We found that echinacoside inhibited sepsis-induced acute lung injury and oxidative stress while preserving endothelial function. In vitro experiments demonstrated that echinacoside activated SIRT1 and promoted its expression. The activated SIRT1 was competitively bound to p22 phox, inhibiting the activation of NOX4 and facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of NOX4. Additionally, SIRT1 deacetylated Nrf2, promoting the downstream expression of antioxidant enzymes, thus enhancing the NOX4-Nrf2 axis and mitigating oxidative stress-induced endothelial cell pathologic activation and mitochondrial pathway apoptosis. The SIRT1-mediated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of echinacoside were validated in vivo. Consequently, the SIRT1-regulated NOX4-Nrf2 axis may represent a crucial target for echinacoside in the treatment of sepsis-induced acute lung injury.

Background
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of roxadustat versus epoetin alfa for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related anemia in patients new to dialysis.

Methods
HIMALAYAS was a Phase 3, open-label, epoetin alfa-controlled trial. Eligible adults were incident to hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis for 2 weeks to ≤4 months prior to randomization and had mean hemoglobin (Hb) ≤10.0 g/dL. Primary endpoints were mean Hb (g/dL) change from baseline averaged over Weeks 28–52 regardless of rescue therapy [non-inferiority criterion: lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) for treatment difference >−0.75] and percentage of patients achieving an Hb response between Weeks 1 and 24 censored for rescue therapy (non-inferiority margin for between-group difference −15%). Adverse events were monitored.

Results
The intent-to-treat population included patients randomized to roxadustat (n = 522) or epoetin alfa (n = 521). Mean (standard deviation) Hb changes from baseline averaged over Weeks 28–52 were 2.57 (1.27) and 2.36 (1.21) in the roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups. Roxadustat was non-inferior [least squares mean difference: 0.18 (95% CI 0.08, 0.29)] to epoetin alfa. Percentages of patients with an Hb response were 88.2% and 84.4% in the roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups, respectively. Roxadustat was non-inferior to epoetin alfa [treatment-group difference 3.5% (95% CI −0.7%, 7.7%)]. Adverse event rates were comparable between treatment groups.

Conclusions
Roxadustat was efficacious for correcting and maintaining Hb levels compared with epoetin alfa. Roxadustat had an acceptable safety profile.",1

Dl-3-n-butylphthalide is used to treat mild and moderate acute ischemic stroke. However, the precise underlying mechanism requires further investigation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide action by various means. We used hydrogen peroxide to induce injury to PC12 cells and RAW264.7 cells to mimic neuronal oxidative stress injury in stroke in vitro and examined the effects of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide. We found that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide pretreatment markedly inhibited the reduction in viability and reactive oxygen species production in PC12 cells caused by hydrogen peroxide and inhibited cell apoptosis. Furthermore, Dl-3-n-butylphthalide pretreatment inhibited the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Bnip3. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide also promoted ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α, the key transcription factor that regulates Bax and Bnip3 genes. These findings suggest that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide exhibits a neuroprotective effect on stroke by promoting hypoxia inducible factor-1α ubiquitination and degradation and inhibiting cell apoptosis.",1

Background
The intestinal mechanical barrier plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Our previous study showed keratin 1 (KRT1) was downregulated in UC, but the mechanism by which KRT1 affects the intestinal barrier remains unknown.

Objectives
To explore the mechanism of KRT1 in the intestinal barrier in UC.

Methods
Colonic tissues were collected from 20 UC patients before and after mucosal healing (MH) and 15 healthy controls. The expression of KRT1 was measured by PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model was established in krt1 transgenic (TG) mice, and the mice were treated with methylprednisolone (MP) to explore the role of KRT1 in the intestinal barrier. Inflammation was evaluated through the DAI score, colon, spleen and H&E. The expression of KRT1 and tight junction (TJ) proteins in mouse was analysed by the same methods.

Results
The transcription and expression of KRT1 in UC was decreased and recovered after MH but did not reach the level of the healthy controls. Similar to the clinical results, the expression of krt1 was decreased in DSS-induced colitis and upregulated after MP. Moreover, the krt1 TG group exhibited less inflammation than wild-type (WT) group. The expression of Occludin and ZO-1 decreased after DSS induction, the decreases in Occludin and ZO-1 in the krt1 TG group were lower than WT group, which was significantly increased after MP, while the expression of Claudin-2 exhibited the opposite effect.

Conclusions
Keratin 1 maintains the intestinal barrier by upregulating TJ proteins in UC.

Purpose: Owing to the late diagnosis and frequent metastasis, ovarian cancer (OC) exhibits a high
mortality rate. The study was intended to figure out the function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
HCP5 in OC metastasis.
Methods: Microarray analysis was conducted to probe aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in OC tissues.
Artificial silencing of lncRNA HCP5 was introduced in OC cells to identify its role in cell viability,
invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The potential downstream
targets of lncRNA HCP5 were predicted by bio-information system and validated through dual
luciferase reporter gene assays. Silencing of microRNA-525-5p (miR-525-5p) was introduced in
cells to probe its role in cell behaviors. Xenograft tumors were induced in nude mice for in vivo
experiments.
Results: High expression of lncRNA HCP5 was found in OC tissues and cells. Silencing of
lncRNA HCP5 led to a decrease in cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT process.
LncRNA HCP is mainly sub-localized in cytoplasm. LncRNA HCP could act as a sponge for
miR-525-5p, which could further bind to polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Knockdown of
miR-525-5p partly recovered the biological behaviors of OC cells inhibited by HCP5 silencing. In
addition, HCP5 promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activity. Silencing of lncRNA HCP5
also impedes growth and metastasis of tumor in mice.
Conclusion: The study suggested that lncRNA HCP5 might promote malignant behaviors of OC
cells through the miR-525-5p/PRC1 crosstalk and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Silencing of HCP5
might serve as a novel option for OC treatment.

"Abstract
Previous studies have suggested that hypoxic responses are regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which in turn promote the malignant progression of glioblastoma (GBM) by inhibiting apoptosis and increasing proliferation; these events lead to a poor prognosis of GBM patients. However, there are still no HIF-targeted therapies for the treatment of GBM. We have conducted series of experiments and discovered that GBM cells exhibit features indicative of malignant progression and are present in a hypoxic environment. Knocking out HIF1α or HIF2α alone resulted in no significant change in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in response to acute hypoxia, but cells showed inhibition of stemness expression and chemosensitization to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. However, simultaneously knocking out HIF1α and HIF2α inhibited cell cycle arrest and promoted proliferation with decreased stemness, making GBM cells more sensitive to chemotherapy, which could improve patient prognosis. Thus, HIF1α and HIF2α regulate each other with negative feedback. In addition, HIF1α and HIF2α are upstream regulators of epidermal growth factor (EGF), which controls the malignant development of GBM through the EGFR–PI3K/AKT–mTOR–HIF1α signalling pathway. In brief, the HIF1α/HIF2α–EGF/EGFR–PI3K/AKT–mTOR–HIF1α signalling axis contributes to the growth of GBM through a positive feedback mechanism. Finally, HIF1α and HIF2α regulate Sox2 and Klf4, contributing to stemness expression and inducing cell cycle arrest, thus increasing malignancy in GBM. In summary, HIF1α and HIF2α regulate glioblastoma malignant progression through the EGFR–PI3K/AKT pathway via a positive feedback mechanism under the effects of Sox2 and Klf4, which provides a new tumour development model and strategy for glioblastoma treatment.",1
"Abstract
The present study aimed to explore the role of long non‑coding (lnc)RNA FTX and ubiquitin‑conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) in promoting the progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the underlying regulatory mechanism. Relative levels of lncRNA FTX, UBE2C, AKT, CDK1 and CDK6 in RCC cell lines were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative (RT‑q). Expression levels of UBE2C, phosphorylated (p)‑AKT/AKT, p‑CDK1/CDK1 and p‑CDK6/CDK6 in RCC and paracancerous specimens and RCC cells were measured by western blot or immunohistochemistry assay. In addition, the proliferative rate, cell viability, cell cycle progression, migratory rate and invasive rate of RCC cells overexpressing lncRNA FTX by lentivirus transfection were determined by a series of functional experiments, including the colony formation assay, MTT assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay and wound healing assay. The targeted binding relationship in the lncRNA FTX/miR‑4429/UBE2C axis was validated by dual‑luciferase reporter assay. By intervening microRNA (miR)‑4492 and UBE2C by the transfection of miR‑4429‑mimics or short interfering UBE2C‑2, the regulatory effect of lncRNA FTX/miR‑4429/UBE2C axis on the progression of RCC was evaluated. Finally, a xenograft model of RCC in nude mice was established by subcutaneous implantation, thus evaluating the in vivo function of lncRNA FTX in the progression of RCC. The results showed that lncRNA FTX and UBE2C were upregulated in RCC specimens and cell lines. The overexpression of lncRNA FTX in RCC cells upregulated UBE2C. In addition, the overexpression of lncRNA FTX promoted the cell viability and proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities of RCC cells and accelerated the cell cycle progression. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay validated that lncRNA FTX exerted the miRNA sponge effect on miR‑4429, which was bound to UBE2C 3'UTR. Knockdown of UBE2C effectively reversed the regulatory effects of overexpressed lncRNA FTX on the abovementioned phenotypes of RCC cells. In the xenograft model of RCC, the mice implanted with RCC cells overexpressing lncRNA FTX showed a larger tumor size and higher tumor weight than those of controls, while the in vivo knockdown of UBE2C significantly reduced the size of RCC lesions, indicating the reversed cancer‑promoting effect of lncRNA FTX. Overall, the present study showed that lncRNA FTX was upregulated in RCC and could significantly promote the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities, enhancing the viability and accelerating the cell cycle progression of RCC cells by exerting the miRNA sponge effect on miR‑4429 and thus upregulating UBE2C. lncRNA FTX and UBE2C are potential molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets of RCC.",1
"Abstract
The etiology and reasons underlying the ethnic disparities in systemic sclerosis (SSc) remain unknown. African Americans are disproportionally affected by SSc and yet are underrepresented in research. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the association of DNA methylation levels with SSc in dermal fibroblasts from patients of African ancestry. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on primary dermal fibroblasts from 15 SSc patients and 15 controls of African ancestry, and over 3.8 million CpG sites were tested for differential methylation patterns between cases and controls. The dermal fibroblasts from African American patients exhibited widespread reduced DNA methylation. Differentially methylated CpG sites were most enriched in introns and intergenic regions while depleted in 5′ UTR, promoters, and CpG islands. Seventeen genes and eleven promoters showed significant differential methylation, mostly in non-coding RNA genes and pseudogenes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed an enrichment of pathways related to interferon signaling and mesenchymal differentiation. The hypomethylation of DLX5 and TMEM140 was accompanied by these genes’ overexpression in patients but underexpression for lncRNA MGC12916. These data show that differential methylation occurs in dermal fibroblasts from African American patients with SSc and identifies novel coding and non-coding genes.

Purpose: Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) induces cardiomyocytes death and leads
to loss of cardiac function. Circular RNAs (circRNA) have gain increasing interests in
modulating myocardial IRI. In this study, we aim to investigate the role and exact mechanism of
circTLK1 in the pathogenesis of myocardial IRI.
Methods: Myocardial IRI was developed in mice with measuring hemodynamic parameters and
the activity of serum myocardial enzymes to evaluate cardiac function. HE and TTC staining
were performed to assess infarct area. Expression patterns of circTLK1 and miR-214 were
investigated using qRT-PCR assay. Gene expression of circTLK1, miR-214 or RIPK was altered
by transfecting with their overexpression or knockdown vectors. The apoptosis of cardimyocytes
was assessed by TUNEL staining and Caspase-3 activity analysis. Apoptosis-related markers
Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase3, as well as TNF-α signals were determined by western blotting. The
interactions of circTLK1/miR-214 and miR-214/RIPK1 were verified using luciferase reporter
assay. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was subjected to further definite the direct binding of
circTLK1/miR-214. The regulatory network of circTLK1/miR-214/RIPK1 was further validated
in vivo.
Results: circTLK1 was an up-regulated circRNA found in a myocardial IRI mouse model. Mice
with silencing circTLK1 significantly alleviated the impaired cardiac function indexes and
decreased infarct area, thus attenuating the pathogenesis of myocardial IRI. Knockdown of
circTLK1 dramatically decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis, which was determined by
apoptosis-related proteins. miR-214 was identified as a downstream effector to reverse
circTLK1-mediated damage effects in myocardial IRI. miR-214 could directly target RIPK1 via
binding to its’ 3’-UTR. Overexpression of RIPK1 led to impaired cardiac function indexes, 
6
increased infarct area, and cell apoptosis, which abolished the protective effects of miR-214. The
TNF signaling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in the circTLK1/miR-214/RIPK1
regulatory network in myocardial IRI.
Conclusion: Taken together, our study revealed an up-regulated circRNA, circTLK1, could
exacerbate myocardial IRI via targeting miR-214/RIPK1-mediated TNF signaling pathway,
which may provide therapeutic targets for treatment.

"Abstract
Proton therapy and plaque-based brachytherapy are considered efficient radiotherapy modalities for
intraocular tumor irradiation. The current study aims to measure and compare the dosimetric features of
these methods through a film dosimetry approach inside an eyeball phantom.
A 3D-printed PLA (polylactic acid)-based eyeball phantom was applied for phantom irradiation. For
brachytherapy, COMS and CGD plaques respectively containing the
125
I and
106Ru radioactive sources
were employed. Proton irradiation was performed using the clinical beamline of the CNAO oncological
hadron therapy center. PDD (percentage depth dose), transverse dose profile, 2D and 3D dose distribution,
as well as DVH (dose volume histogram) data relevant to the tumor volume and surrounding healthy
tissues were measured for applied treatment techniques using Gafchromic EBT3 film dosimetry approach
and compared together.
A more uniform dose distribution inside the tumor volume was found in the case of the proton beam
concerning two other techniques. Furthermore, a proton beam can better spare healthy organs distributed
around the tumor region. Besides, COMS plaque can lead to better clinical outcomes concerning CGD
plaque.
Viewpoint to the dose uniformity inside the target volume as well as sparing the healthy tissues, proton
therapy would be the optimal choice. On the other hand, the photon beam can be preferred to the electron
beam if proton therapy facilities are not available. Nevertheless, based on the importance of the healthy
organ which should be spared, the COMS or CGD plaque can be selected for radiotherapy",1

Background. The drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) has already been used in hepatic malignancies. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE in treating primary or secondary liver cancer. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated 59 patients with hepatic malignancies, including 41 patients with primary liver cancer and 18 patients with secondary liver cancer, between September 2016 and February 2019. All patients were treated with DEB-TACE. Objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were evaluated by mRECIST. The pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 represented no pain, and a score of ten was unbearable. Adverse reactions were assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 (CTCAE4.0). Results. In the subgroup of primary liver cancer, 3 patients (7.32%) got complete response, 13 patients (31.71%) got partial response, 21 patients (51.22%) experienced stable disease, and 4 patients (9.76%) suffered progressive disease; ORR was 39.02% and DCR was 90.24%. In the subgroup of secondary liver cancer, 0 patients (0%) got complete response, 6 patients (33.33%) got partial response, 11 patients (61.11%) experienced stable disease, and 1 patient (5.56%) suffered progressive disease; ORR was 33.33% and DCR was 94.44%. We did not find any difference when comparing the efficacy between primary and secondary liver cancer (P = 0.612). The one-year survival rate was 70.73% for primary liver cancer and 61.11% for secondary liver cancer. There was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.52). For the patients with CR or PR, no factor could predict the efficacy of DEB-TACE. The most common treatment-related adverse reactions were short-term liver function disorders. The symptoms included fever (20.34%), abdomen pain (16.95%), and vomiting (5.08%), all patients with adverse reactions got remission after treatment. Conclusions. DEB-TACE has a promising effect in the treatment of primary or secondary liver cancer. The treatment-related adverse reactions are tolerable.",1

This study compares laparoscopic RYGB (L-RYGB) and robotic RYGB (R-RYGB) performed by the same team after the learning curve in both approaches. A retrospective cohort study was done, and the surgical outcome was analyzed in 30 days and 12 months for patients with similar characteristics and an equal number of cases in each group (233 cases). Four hundred and sixty-six patients were included in this study. Mean age was 46.8 ± 8.3 years and 2/3 were women. R-RYGB presented a longer operative time (150.7 versus 135.4 min; p < 0.001) with no differences in the length of hospital stay. The main 30-day complications were G-J stricture, leakage, and intraluminal bleeding. The reoperation rate was 1.6% by leakage (G-J anastomosis) and was higher in R-RYGB (2.1 versus 0.4; p = 0.108). The multivariate analysis identified that L-RYGB was the factor independently associated with a LOS longer than 2 days (odds ratio: 4.7, 95% CI: 2.6–8.2, p value < 0.001). At the FU time (12 months), no differences between the groups were found. The outcomes between the groups after the learning curve did not present differences in terms of 30 days and 12 months of FU when same preoperative characteristics and an equal number of cases in each group are considered. L-RYGB was the unique independent factor associated with long LOS.",1
"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug being investigated for repurposing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

Background
Dual specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22), also named as Jun N-terminal kinase pathway associated phosphatase recently, is reported to be closely engaged in immune and inflammation regulation. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between synovium DUSP22 and serum DUSP22 levels and to explore their correlation with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk, inflammation, and disease activity.

Methods
Synovium and serum samples from 42 RA patients with knee involvement underwent arthroscopy, and 20 knee trauma patients were collected. Besides, serum samples from 40 healthy controls were also obtained. Synovium DUSP22 expression was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while serum DUSP22 level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results
Synovium DUSP22 level was greatly decreased in RA patients compared to trauma controls (p < 0.001), and it was negatively correlated with tender joint count (TJC) (r = −0.318, p = 0.040), C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = −0.330, p = 0.033), and Lysholm score (r = −0.423, p = 0.005) in RA patients. Serum DUSP22 level was lowest in RA patients, followed by trauma controls, then highest in healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serum DUSP22 level was negatively associated with TJC (r = −0.438, p = 0.004), swollen joint count (SJC) (r = −0.372, p = 0.015), CRP (r = −0.391, p = 0.011), and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28ESR) score (r = −0.406, p = 0.008), and it increased after treatment (p = 0.001) in RA patients. In addition, serum DUSP22 level positively related to synovium DUSP22 level in RA patients (r = 0.394, p = 0.010).

Conclusion
Synovium and serum DUSP22 are intercorrelated and insufficiently expressed in RA patients; meanwhile, their deficiency correlates with increased systemic inflammation, disease activity, and joint dysfunction.",1

Background
Strokes are becoming less severe due to increased numbers of intensive care units and improved treatments. As patients survive longer, post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has become a major health public issue. Diabetes has been identified as an independent predictive factor for PSCI. Here, we characterized a clinically relevant mouse model of PSCI, induced by permanent cerebral artery occlusion in diabetic mice, and investigated whether a reliable biomarker of PSCI may emerge from the kynurenine pathway which has been linked to inflammatory processes.

Methods
Cortical infarct was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in male diabetic mice (streptozotocin IP). Six weeks later, cognitive assessment was performed using the Barnes maze, hippocampi long-term potentiation using microelectrodes array recordings, and neuronal death, white matter rarefaction and microglia/macrophages density assessed in both hemispheres using imunohistochemistry. Brain and serum metabolites of the kynurenin pathway were measured using HPLC and mass fragmentography. At last, these same metabolites were measured in the patient’s serum, at the acute phase of stroke, to determine if they could predict PSCI 3 months later.

Results
We found long-term spatial memory was impaired in diabetic mice 6 weeks after stroke induction. Synaptic plasticity was completely suppressed in both hippocampi along with increased neuronal death, white matter rarefaction in both striatum, and increased microglial/macrophage density in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Brain and serum quinolinic acid concentrations and quinolinic acid over kynurenic acid ratios were significantly increased compared to control, diabetic and non-diabetic ischemic mice, where PSCI was absent. These putative serum biomarkers were strongly correlated with degradation of long-term memory, neuronal death, microglia/macrophage infiltration and white matter rarefaction. Moreover, we identified these same serum biomarkers as potential predictors of PSCI in a pilot study of stroke patients.

Conclusions
we have established and characterized a new model of PSCI, functionally and structurally, and we have shown that the QUIN/KYNA ratio could be used as a surrogate biomarker of PSCI, which may now be tested in large prospective studies of stroke patients.

"The inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in molecular dynamics simulations is one of the major obstacles for an accurate modeling of molecular scattering processes involving more than a couple of atoms. An efficient method to incorporate these effects is ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). Here, we extend the scope of our recently developed method based on non-equilibrium RPMD (NE-RPMD) from triatomic chemical reactions to reactions involving more atoms. We test the robustness and accuracy of the method by computing the integral cross sections for the H/F + CH4/CHD3 reactions where the methane molecule is either initially in its vibrational ground or excited state (C–H stretch). Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which NQEs are described by NE-RPMD. The method shows significant improvement over the quasiclassical trajectory approach while remaining computationally efficient.",1
"Abstract
Mastitis is a common disease in the dairy industry that causes huge economic losses worldwide. Exosomes (carrying proteins, miRNA, lncRNA, etc.) play a vital role in the regulation of immune response. lncRNA can play a variety of regulatory roles by combining with protein, RNA, and DNA. The expression of mRNA and lncRNA in exosomes derived from bovine mammary epithelial cells infected by S. aureus is rarely understood. To explore this issue, RNA sequencing analysis was performed on exosomes derived from S. aureus-infected and noninfected MAC-T cells. Analysis of the sequencing results showed that there were 186 differentially expressed genes, 431 differentially expressed mRNAs and 19 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the exosomes derived from S. aureus-infected and noninfected MAC-T cells. By predicting lncRNA target genes, it was found that 19 differentially expressed lncRNAs all acted on multiple mRNAs in cis and trans. GO analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes and lncRNA target genes played significant roles in such metabolism (reactive oxygen species metabolic processes), transmembrane transport, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, and response to cytokines. KEGG enrichment indicated that lncRNA target genes gathered in the TNF pathway, Notch pathway, MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B pathway, Hippo pathway, p53 pathway, reactive oxygen species metabolic processes, and longevity regulating pathway. In summary, all data indicated that differentially expressed gene, mRNA, and lncRNA in transcriptional profiling of exosomes participated in bacterial invasion and adhesion, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis-related signaling pathway. The data obtained in this study would provide valuable resource for understanding the lncRNA information in exosomes derived from dairy cow mammary epithelial cells and conduced to the study of S. aureus infection in dairy cow mammary glands.",1

In 2020 COVID-19 led to an unprecedented stream of papers being submitted to journals. Scientists and physicians all around the globe were in need for information about this new disease. In this climate, many articles were accepted after extremely fast peer-reviews to provide the scientific community with the latest discoveries and knowledge. Unfortunately, this also led to articles retraction due to authors’ misconduct or errors in methodology and/or conclusions. The aim of this study is to investigate the number and characteristics of retracted papers, and to explore the main causes that led to retraction. We conducted a systematic review on retracted articles, using PubMed as data source. Our inclusion criteria were the following: English-language retracted articles that reported original data, results, opinions or hypotheses on COVID-19 and Sars-CoV-2. Twenty-seven retracted articles were identified, mainly reporting observational studies and opinion pieces. Many articles published during the first year of the pandemic have been retracted, mainly due to the authors' scientific misconduct. Duplications, plagiarism, frauds and absence of consent, were the main reasons for retractions. In modern medicine, researchers are required to publish frequently, and, especially during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, when articles were rapidly published, gaps in peer-reviews system and in the path to scientific publication arose.",1

To date, no antiviral therapy has shown proven clinical effectiveness in treating patients with COVID-19. We assessed the efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized Egyptian patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir (200 mg on the first day followed by 100 mg daily for the next 9 days intravenously infused over 30–60 minutes) in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital stay and mortality rate. The need for mechanical ventilation was assessed as a secondary outcome. Two hundred patients (100 in each group) completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The remdesivir group showed a significantly lower median duration of hospital stay (10 days) than the control group (16 days; P < 0.001). Eleven of the patients in the remdesivir group needed mechanical ventilation compared with eight patients in the control group (P = 0.469). The mortality rate was comparable between the two groups (P = 0.602). Mortality was significantly associated with older age, elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated D-dimer, and the need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.039, 0.003, 0.001, and < 0.001 respectively). Remdesivir had a positive influence on length of hospital stay, but it had no mortality benefit in Egyptian patients with COVID-19. Its use, in addition to standard care including dexamethasone, should be considered, particularly in low- and middle-income countries when other effective options are scarce.

"Microglia are emerging as a key cell type in neurodegenerative diseases, yet human microglia are challenging to study
in vitro. We developed an in vitro cell model system composed of human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi)
cells that recapitulated key aspects of microglia phenotype and function. We then used this model system to perform
an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in
which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby
gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood
monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state
that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk
haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells. We propose that increased LRRK2 gene expression by MDMi cells could be a functional
outcome of rs76904798, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the LRKK2 locus that is associated with Parkinson’s disease.",1

A temperature-responsive solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coating was prepared via in-situ atom
transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method. By controlling the temperature of solution below and
above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the coating, it can switch between hydrophilic and
hydrophobic, thus providing a convenient approach for the selective extraction of analytes with different
polarities. The average extraction amount of temperature-responsive coating for polar analytes is about
1.5-fold to that of non-polar ones below LCST, and vice versa. Effective extraction of three biomacromolecules was also obtained by controlling the temperature below or above LCST. The adsorption capacity of the coating for the hydrophilic biomacromolecules at 15 °C is 1.5-2 folds that of 50 °C, whereas
the adsorption capacity of the coating to BSA at 50 °C is about 3 folds that of 15 °C. This approach holds
great promise for SPME because it provides a simple strategy to prepare bifunctional coatings for various

The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant, livestock-associated Enterococcus faecalis represents a public health concern. Here, we report the isolation, molecular detection of virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants, in addition to the phylogenetic analyses of 20 Enterococcus species using whole genome sequencing analysis of 15 Enterococcus faecalis strains including six strains of three novel sequence types, three Enterococcus faecium and two Enterococcus durans. All strains were isolated from food chain animals in South Africa. Enterococcus strains were isolated on bile aesculin azide agar, followed by identification using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method. The genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted and sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence reads were trimmed and de novo assembled. The assembled contigs were analyzed for antimicrobial resistance genes and chromosomal mutations, extra-chromosomal plasmids, and multi-locus sequence type (MLST). Multidrug antimicrobial resistance genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (ant(6)-Ia, aph(3′)-IIIa, sat4, and spw), lincosamides (lnu(B), lsa(A), and lsa(E)), macrolides (erm(B)), trimethoprim (dfrG) and tetracyclines (tet(L) and tet(M)) were identified. Plasmid replicons were detected in seven E. faecalis and three E. faecium isolates. The sequence type (ST) of each isolate was determined using the Enterococcus PubMLST database. Ten STs were identified in the collection, three of which (ST1240, ST1241, and ST1242) have not been previously reported and are described in the present study for the first time. To compare the sequenced strains to other previously sequenced E. faecalis strains, assembled sequences of E. faecalis from livestock were downloaded from the PubMLST database. Core genome-based phylogenetic analysis was performed using ParSNP. The detection of multiple drug-resistance in Enterococcus including E. faecalis and E. faecium highlights the significance of genomic surveillance to monitor the spread of antimicrobial resistance in food chain animals. In addition, the genome sequences of Enterococcus strains reported in the present study will serve as a reference point for future molecular epidemiological studies of livestock-associated and antibiotic-resistant E. faecalis in Africa. In addition, this study enables the in-depth analysis of E. faecalis genomic structure, as well as provides valuable information on the phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance, and the pathogenesis of livestock-associated E. faecalis and E. faecium.

"Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality rate among gynecological malignancies. Current treatment options are limited and ineffective, prompting the discovery of reliable biomarkers. Exosome lncRNAs, carrying genetic information, are promising new markers. Previous studies only focused on exosome-related genes and employed the Lasso algorithm to construct prediction models, which are not robust.

Methods: 420 OC patients from the TCGA datasets were divided into training and validation datasets. The GSE102037 dataset was used for external validation. LncRNAs associated with exosome-related genes were selected using Pearson analysis. Univariate COX regression analysis was used to filter prognosis-related lncRNAs. The overlapping lncRNAs were identified as candidate lncRNAs for machine learning. Based on 10 machine learning algorithms and 117 algorithm combinations, the optimal predictor combinations were selected according to the C index. The exosome-related LncRNA Signature (ERLS) model was constructed using multivariate COX regression. Based on the median risk score of the training datasets, the patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the time-dependent ROC, immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and immune checkpoints were analyzed.

Results: 64 lncRNAs were subjected to a machine-learning process. Based on the stepCox (forward) combined Ridge algorithm, 20 lncRNA were selected to construct the ERLS model. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high-risk group had a lower survival rate. The area under the curve (AUC) in predicting OS at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.758, 0.816, and 0.827 in the entire TCGA cohort. xCell and ssGSEA analysis showed that the low-risk group had higher immune cell infiltration, which may contribute to the activation of cytolytic activity, inflammation promotion, and T-cell co-stimulation pathways. The low-risk group had higher expression levels of PDL1, CTLA4, and higher TMB. The ERLS model can predict response to anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy. Patients with low expression of PDL1 or high expression of CTLA4 and low ERLS exhibited significantly better survival prospects, whereas patients with high ERLS and low levels of PDL1 or CTLA4 exhibited the poorest outcomes.

Conclusion: Our study constructed an ERLS model that can predict prognostic risk and immunotherapy response, optimizing clinical management for OC patients.

"Abstract
Single crystals which exhibit mechanical flexibility are promising materials for advanced technological applications. Before such materials can be used, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of bending is needed. Using single crystal X-ray diffraction and microfocus Raman spectroscopy, we study in atomic detail the high-pressure response of the plastically flexible coordination polymer [Zn(μ-Cl)2(3,5-dichloropyridine)2]n (1). Contradictory to three-point bending, quasi-hydrostatic compression of (1) is completely reversible, even following compression to over 9 GPa. A structural phase transition is observed at ca. 5 GPa. DFT calculations show this transition to result from the pressure-induced softening of low-frequency vibrations. This phase transition is not observed during three-point-bending. Microfocus synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed that bending yields significant mosaicity, as opposed to compression. Hence, our studies indicate of overall disparate mechanical responses of bulk flexibility and quasi-hydrostatic compression within the same crystal lattice. We suspect this to be a general feature of plastically bendable materials.

Proximal femoral fractures are a serious complication, especially for elderly patients. Detailed epidemiological analyzes provide a valuable resource for stakeholders in the health care system in order to foresee future development possibly influenceable by adaption of therapeutic procedures and prevention strategies. This work aimed at answering the following research questions: (1) What are the incidence rates of proximal femoral fractures in the elderly U.S. population? (2) What is the preferred treatment procedure for these fractures? Proximal femoral fractures occurred between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 in patients ≥ 65 years were identified from the Medicare Physician Service Records Data Base. The 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, equivalent to the records from approximately 2.5 million enrollees formed the basis of this study. Fractures were grouped into head/neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures. The overall incidence rate, age and sex specific incidence rates as well as incidence rate ratios were calculated. Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were used to identify procedures and operations. In 2019, a total number of 7982 femoral head/neck fractures was recorded. In comparison to 9588 cases in 2009, the incidence substantially decreased by 26.6% from 666.7/100,000 inhabitants to 489.3/100,000 inhabitants (z =  − 5.197, p < 0.001). Also, in intertrochanteric fractures, a significant decline in the incidence by 17.3% was evident over the years from 367.7/100,000 inhabitants in 2009 to 304.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019 (z =  − 2.454, p = 0.014). A similar picture was observable for subtrochanteric fractures, which decreased by 29.6% (51.0 cases per 100,000 to 35.9 cases per 100,000) over the time period (z =  − 1.612, p = 0.107). Head/neck fractures were mainly treated with an arthroplasty (n = 36,301, 40.0%). The majority of intertrochanteric fractures and subtrochanteric fractures received treatment with an intramedullary device (n = 34,630, 65.5% and n = 5870, 77.1%, respectively). The analysis indicated that the incidence of all types of proximal femoral neck fractures decreased for the population of elderly patients in the U.S. within the last decade. Treatment of head and neck fractures was mainly conducted through arthroplasty, while intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures predominantly received an intramedullary nailing.",1
"Abstract
The present study examined the effect of semantic relatedness on immediate serial recall. The type of semantic relatedness was manipulated by using lists of study items that are or are not from the same category (e.g., apple, banana, grape), and/or lists of study items that are or are not associated with each other (e.g., honey, sugar, sour). Whether the type of semantic relatedness was manipulated within or between participants, positive categorical and associative relatedness effects occurred in percent serial recall and negative categorical and associative relatedness effects occurred in order retention after the level of item recall was controlled. The R parameters, which were estimated by fitting Schweickert's (1993) multinomial processing tree model to the percent serial recall data, indicated a positive semantic relatedness effect on item redintegration. Regression analyses further showed that inter-item associative strength significantly predicts the percent serial recall after partialling out the effect of types of semantic relatedness or theme–item associative strength. Both Hulme et al.'s (1997) item redintegration theory and Stuart and Hulme's (2000) associative-link hypothesis are discussed.",1
"Abstract
Bodily sensations impact metaphorically related judgments. Are such effects obligatory or do they follow the logic of knowledge
accessibility? If the latter, the impact of sensory information should be moderated by the accessibility of the related metaphor at
the time of sensory experience. We manipulated whether “importance” was on participants’ minds when they held a physically
heavy versus light book. Participants held the book while making an importance judgment versus returned it before making the
judgment (Study 1) or learned prior to holding the book that the study was about “importance evaluations” versus “graphics
evaluations” (Study 2). In both studies, the same book was judged more important when its heft was increased but only when
importance was on participants’ minds at the time of sensory experience. We conclude that sensory experiences only impact
metaphorically related judgments when the applicable metaphor is highly accessible at the time of experience.",1

Expression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) keratin-7 antisense (KRT7-AS) is downregulated in various types of cancer; however, the impact of KRT7-AS deficiency on tumorigenesis and apoptosis is enigmatic. We aim to explore the influence of KRT7-AS in carcinogenesis and apoptosis. We found that KRT7-AS was deficient in breast and lung cancers, and low levels of KRT7-AS were a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer. Cellular studies showed that silencing of KRT7-AS in lung cancer cells increased oncogenic Keratin-7 levels and enhanced tumorigenesis, but diminished cancer apoptosis of the cancer cells; by contrast, overexpression of KRT7-AS inhibited lung cancer cell tumorigenesis. Additionally, KRT7-AS sensitized cancer cells to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, consequently enhancing cancer cell apoptosis. In vivo, KRT7-AS overexpression significantly suppressed tumor growth in xenograft mice, while silencing of KRT7-AS promoted tumor growth. Mechanistically, KRT7-AS reduced the levels of oncogenic Keratin-7 and significantly elevated amounts of the key tumor suppressor PTEN in cancer cells through directly binding to PTEN protein via its core nucleic acid motif GGCAAUGGCGG. This inhibited the ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of PTEN protein, therefore elevating PTEN levels in cancer cells. We also found that KRT7-AS gene transcription was driven by the transcription factor RXRα; intriguingly, the small molecule berberine enhanced KRT7-AS expression, reduced tumorigenesis, and promoted apoptosis of cancer cells. Collectively, KRT7-AS functions as a new tumor suppressor and an apoptosis enhancer in lung and breast cancers, and we unraveled that the RXRα-KRT7-AS-PTEN signaling axis controls carcinogenesis and apoptosis. Our findings highlight a tumor suppressive role of endogenous KRT7-AS in cancers and an important effect the RXRα-KRT7-AS-PTEN axis on control of cancer cell tumorigenesis and apoptosis, and offer a new platform for developing novel therapeutics against cancers.",1
"Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Accurate diagnosis of this disease in the early stages is crucial for its initial treatment. This paper aims to present a comparative study on the methods developed by machine learning techniques in PD diagnosis. We rely on clustering and prediction learning approaches to perform the comparative study. Specifically, we use different clustering techniques for PD data clustering and support vector regression ensembles to predict Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS. The results are then compared with the other prediction learning approaches, multiple linear regression, neurofuzzy, and support vector regression techniques. The comparative study is performed on a real-world PD dataset. The prediction results of data analysis on a PD real-world dataset revealed that expectation-maximization with the aid of SVR ensembles can provide better prediction accuracy in relation to decision trees, deep belief network, neurofuzzy, and support vector regression combined with other clustering techniques in the prediction of Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS.",1

Background
Insulin resistance (IR) is involved in the pathophysiological processes of arrhythmias. Increasing evidence suggests triglyceride and glucose (TyG) index, metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), and triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio are simple and reliable surrogates for IR. Although they have been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), evidence supporting this is limited. Here, this is the first study to investigate the association between TyG-BMI index and AF recurrence following radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). The performance of the four non-insulin-based IR indexes in predicting AF recurrence after ablation was explored.

Methods
A total of 2242 AF patients who underwent a de novo RFCA between June 2018 to January 2022 at two hospitals in China were included in this retrospective study. The predictive values of IR indexes for AF recurrence after ablation were assessed.

Results
During 1-year follow-up, 31.7% of patients experienced AF recurrence. The multivariable analysis revealed that TyG index, METS-IR, and TyG-BMI index were independent risk factors for AF recurrence. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a connection between METS-IR, TyG-BMI index, and AF recurrence (P < 0.001). Furthermore, incorporating the METS-IR or TyG-BMI index to the basic risk model with fully adjusted factors considerably enhanced the forecast of AF recurrence, as demonstrated by the C-statistic, continuous net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement.

Conclusions
TyG index, METS-IR, and TyG-BMI index were independently associated with AF recurrence following ablation. Among the four non-insulin-based IR indexes, TyG-BMI had the highest predictive value, followed by METS-IR.

"Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the important factors leading to death in today's society. Therefore, to study the related mechanism of MI and reduce myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury is an important link to reduce MI injury. MI mice in vivo and cell model in vitro were constructed. The cardiac function and MI area of mice were detected, and myocardial tissue injury was detected by HE staining. ALAS2 expression in mice myocardial tissue was detected by IHC. The expressions of lncRNA-SNHG8, METTL3, PTBP1 and ALAS2 in myocardial tissue or cardiomyocytes were detected by qRT-PCR assay. MTT assay was used to measured viability of cardiomyocytes. The oxidative stress level in myocardial tissue or cardiomyocytes was detected by ELISA assay and ROS assay. RIP-qPCR and RNA pulldown assays determined the interaction between METTL3 and lncRNA-SNHG8, as well as PTBP1 and ALAS2. lncRNA-SNHG8 knockdown in MI mice was reduced myocardial infarction size, alleviated myocardial tissue injury and oxidative stress, and inhibited ALAS2 expression in myocardial tissue. RNA pulldown and RIP assays showed that lncRNA-SNHG8 binged with PTBP1 and PTBP1 interacted with ALAS2 mRNA. Knockdown of lncRNA-SNHG8, METTL3 or PTBP1 in MI cells enhanced viability of myocardial cells, attenuated ROS release and MDA level, increased SOD level, alleviated oxidative stress. ALAS overexpression attenuated the corresponding effect of knockdown of lncRNA-SNHG8 and/or PTBP1 on MI cells. In sum, our paper is demonstrated for the first time that METTL3 can promote lncRNA-SNHG8 through m6A modification, thereby regulating ALAS2 to induce oxidative stress and aggravate myocardial injury.",1
"Several psychotherapy treatments exist for posttraumatic stress disorder. This study examines the treatment preferences of treatment-seeking traumatized adults in Germany and investigates the reasons for their treatment choices. Preferences for prolonged exposure, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), psychodynamic psychotherapy and stabilization were assessed via an online survey. Reasons for preferences were analyzed by means of thematic coding by two independent rates. 104 traumatized adults completed the survey. Prolonged exposure and CBT were each preferred by nearly 30%, and EMDR and psychodynamic psychotherapy were preferred by nearly 20%. Stabilization was significantly less preferred than all other options, by only 4%. Significantly higher proportions of patients were disinclined to choose EMDR and stabilization. Patients who preferred psychodynamic psychotherapy were significantly older than those who preferred CBT. Reasons underlying preferences included the perceived treatment mechanisms and treatment efficacy. Traumatized patients vary in their treatment preferences. Preference assessments may help clinicians comprehensively address patients' individual needs and thus improve therapy outcomes.",1
"Introduction: Firearm injuries are a leading cause of morbidity among children, but data on
healthcare utilization and expenditures after injury are limited. This study sought to analyze
healthcare encounters and expenditures for 2 years following a non-fatal firearm injury.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study performed between 2020‒2022 of children aged 0‒18
years with ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis codes for firearm injury from 2010‒2016 in the Medicaid
MarketScan claims database. Outcomes included the difference in healthcare encounters and
expenditures, including mental health. Descriptive statistics characterized patient demographics
and healthcare utilization. Changes in health expenditures were evaluated with Wilcoxon Sign
Rank Tests.
Results: Among 911 children, there were 12,757 total healthcare encounters the year prior to the
index firearm injury, 15,548 1-year after (p<0.001), and 10,228 total encounters in the second
year (p<0.001). Concomitantly, there was an overall increase of $14.4 million in health
expenditures ($11,415 per patient) 1 year after (p<0.001), and a $0.8 million decrease 2 years
after the firearm injury (p=0.001). The children with low prior expenditures (majority of sample)
had sustained increases throughout the second year post-injury. There was a 31% and 37%
absolute decrease in mental health utilization and expenditures respectively among children 2
years after the firearm injury.
Conclusions: Children who experience non-fatal firearm injury have increased number of
healthcare encounters and healthcare expenditures the year after firearm injury, which is not
sustained for a second year. Mental health utilization and expenditures remain decreased up to 2
years after a firearm injury. More longitudinal research on the morbidity associated with nonfatal firearm injuries is needed. ",1

Objectives
The aim of this work is to investigate the biological effects of IQOS smoking on human gingival fibroblasts and human keratinocytes analysing cell viability, morphology, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle.

Background
Electronic cigarettes and tobacco heating systems have been marketed to reduce smoking damages caused by combustion.

Methods
Human gingival fibroblasts and human keratinocytes viability was determined by a colorimetric assay measuring mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (MTT assay); after an in vitro exposure of 24 h, cell morphology was analysed with scanning electron microscope and cell migration was tested by Scratch assay, a method to mimic the migration of the cells during wound healing in vivo. Apoptosis and cell cycle were analysed with flow cytometry, and the expression of related genes (p53, Bcl2, p16 and p21) was indagated using real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Results
IQOS extracts increased both cell viability (23%-41% with fibroblasts and 30%-79% with keratinocytes) and migration. No morphological alterations were observed. IQOS extracts did not induced an increase in cell death, but rose the number of S- and G2/M-phase cells. IQOS extracts also significantly increased p53 expression by fibroblasts (undiluted and 6.25% dilution, 2- and 3.6-fold higher, respectively) and reduced both Bcl2 (about two- and fivefold, respectively) and p21 expressions (about twofold with both extracts), while on keratinocytes both undiluted and 6.25% dilution extracts increased Bcl2 expression (about four- and threefold higher, respectively) and reduced p53 expression (about two- and fivefold, respectively).

Conclusion
IQOS smoke seemed to induce proliferation as highlighted by a viability assay, and migration and cell cycle analysis. The increased cell proliferation induced by IQOS devices must be carefully investigated for its possible clinical effects on oral cell populations.",1
"Abstract
Like the mechanisms of action as adjuvants, the pharmacodynamics of injected forms of aluminum commonly used in vaccines are not well-characterized, particularly with respect to how differences in schedules impact accumulation and how factors such as genetics and environmental influences on detoxification influence clearance. Previous modeling efforts are based on very little empirical data, with the model by Priest based on whole-body clearance rates estimated from a study involving a single human subject. In this analysis, we explore the expected acute exposures and longer-term whole-body accumulation/clearance across three vaccination schedules: the current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) schedule, the current CDC schedule using low aluminum or no aluminum vaccines, and Dr. Paul Thomas’ “Vaccine Friendly Plan” schedule. We then study the effects of an implicit assumption of the Priest model on whether clearance dynamics from successive doses are influenced by the current level of aluminum or modeled by the assumption that a new dose has its own whole-body dynamics “reset” on the day of injection. We model two additional factors: variation (deficiency) in aluminum detoxification, and a factor added to the Priest equation to model the potential impact of aluminum itself on cellular and whole-body detoxification. These explorations are compared to a previously estimated pediatric dose limit (PDL) of whole-body aluminum exposure and provide a new statistic: %alumTox, the (expected) percentage of days (or weeks) an infant is in aluminum toxicity, reflecting chronic toxicity. We show that among three schedules, the CDC schedule results in the highest %alumTox regardless of model assumptions, and the Vaccine Friendly Plan schedule, which avoids >1 ACV per office visit results in the lowest (expected) %alumTox. These results are conservative, as the MSL is derived from data used by FDA to estimate safety of aluminum in adult humans. These results demonstrate high potential utility of modeling variation in patient responses to aluminum. More empirical data from individuals who are suspected of being intolerant of aluminum from vaccines, evidenced by high aluminum retention, neurodevelopmental disorders and/or a myriad of chronic illnesses would help answer questions on whether the model predictions can be used to estimate parameter values tied to genetic factors including genomic sequence variation and family history of chronic illnesses tied to aluminum exposure.",1
"Abstract
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, French public opinion has been divided about Pr. Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19. In this paper, our aim is to contribute to the understanding of this polarization of public opinion by investigating the relationship between (analytic vs. intuitive) cognitive style and trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Through three studies (total N after exclusion = 950), we found that a more intuitive cognitive style predicted higher trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Moreover, we found that Trust in Raoult was positively associated with belief that truth is political, belief in conspiracy theories, belief in pseudo-medicines and pseudo-medical and conspiratorial beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found a negative association with knowledge of scientific methods and regard for scientific method over personal experience. However, higher trust in Didier Raoult was not associated with self-reported compliance with official regulations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

"BACKGROUND: The urogenital microbiome is associated with urgency and mixed urinary incontinence symptoms and differential treatment responses to pharmacotherapy for urgency urinary incontinence.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe whether the preoperative
urinary and vaginal microbiomes were associated with surgical treatment
responses at 12 months after a midurethral sling operation in women with
mixed urinary incontinence.
STUDY DESIGN: This cohort study compared the preoperative
microbiome compositions of urine and vaginal samples from a subset of
women undergoing a midurethral sling operation in the Effects of Surgical
Treatment Enhanced With Exercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence trial
(NCT01959347) and compared the microbiota in women who were surgical responders vs surgical nonresponders. Twelve-month objective
response was defined as a _x0001_70% reduction from baseline urinary incontinence episodes on a 3-day diary. Subjective response was defined as
a change from baseline in the Urogenital Distress Inventory scores. Bacterial abundance and beta diversity were assessed using 16S ribosomal
RNA sequencing. The primary differential abundance analysis described
predominant bacterial operational taxonomic units associated with responders vs nonresponders using unadjusted and age-adjusted linear
models.
RESULTS: Objective nonresponders (n¼28) compared with responders (n¼72) were older (58.510.7 vs 51.610.2 years) and
more likely postmenopausal without hormone use (odds ratio, 6.4; 95%
confidence interval, 1.8e22.6). Vaginal and urinary microbiota beta
diversities were associated with age (P<.05) for both responders and
nonresponders. Overall, predominant operational taxonomic units
(genera) were Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Tepidimonas, Escherichia,
Streptococcus, and Prevotella. Operational taxonomic units from baseline urine samples were not significantly associated (P threshold¼.05)
with surgical treatment responses. A greater abundance of baseline
vaginal Lactobacillus was associated with an objective response (P¼.04)
and Prevotella with an objective nonresponse (P¼.01). Adjusting for
age, only a greater abundance of baseline vaginal Prevotella was
associated with an objective nonresponse (P¼.01). Moreover, less
abundant vaginal operational taxonomic units were associated with
objective and subjective responses and persistent urinary incontinence
symptoms (P<.05).
CONCLUSION: Women meeting a 70% reduction of urinary incontinence treatment episodes (objective responders) had greater vaginal
Lactobacillus at the time of the surgical procedure; however, controlling for
age diminished this association. Women not meeting a 70% reduction of
urinary incontinence episodes 1 year after a midurethral sling operation
had greater vaginal Prevotella at the time of the midurethral sling operation. Further research is needed to determine whether therapy altering
the vaginal microbiome may impact surgical treatment responses in
women with mixed urinary incontinence.

"Abstract
Recurring evidence suggests that fasting has extensive antitumor effects in various cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the underlying mechanism of this relationship with PTC is unknown. In this study, we study the effect of fasting on glycolysis and mitochondrial function in PTC. We find that fasting impairs glycolysis and reduces mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo and also fasting in vitro and fasting mimicking diets (FMD) in vivo significantly increase the expression of lncRNA-protein kinase C theta antisense RNA 1 (PRKCQ-AS1), during the inhibition of TPC cell glycolysis and mitochondrial function. Moreover, lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 was significantly lower in PTC tissues and cells. In addition, PRKCQ-AS1 overexpression increased PTC cell glycolysis and mitochondrial function; PRKCQ-AS1 knockdown has the opposite effect. On further mechanistic analysis, we identified that PRKCQ-AS1 physically interacts with IGF2BPs and enhances protein arginine methyltransferases 7 (PRMT7) mRNA, which is the key player in regulating glycolysis and mitochondrial function in PTC. Hence, PRKCQ-AS1 inhibits tumor growth while regulating glycolysis and mitochondrial functions via IGF2BPs/PRMT7 signaling. These results indicate that lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 is a key downstream target of fasting and is involved in PTC metabolic reprogramming. Further, the PRKCQ-AS1/IGF2BPs/PRMT7 axis is an ideal therapeutic target for PTC diagnosis and treatment.",1
"Abstract
In daily life, when a bee approaches us while we are sitting in the garden, we must pay attention to that threatening stimulus and give an appropriate response. However, if this bee approaches us while riding a bike, we must inhibit that distractor to avoid an accident. In this case, avoiding the interference of an emotional stimuli and continuing with the task should be preferential. In general, perceptual inhibition is responsible for controlling and suppressing the environmental distractions that interrupt the course of the realization of a goal. In this study, 435 children performed a modified flanker task with entirely irrelevant emotional and neutral stimuli in order to assess perceptual inhibition in contexts with high and low emotional salience. The results showed that entirely irrelevant distractors affected performance, but that there were no significant differences according to whether these distractors were emotionally salient or neutral. These results constitute a first approach to the problem of emotional interference in children considering the multidimensional approach of inhibition.",1

Purpose
Circular RNA (circRNA) serves an important role in tumour genesis and development. But, little is known about its role in lung adenocarcinoma (LA). This study aimed to investigate circRNA6783 expression in peripheral whole blood (PWB) of LA and controls and explore its effect on proliferation and apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (LAC).

Patients and Methods
The levels of circRNA6783 in LA cell lines and peripheral whole blood (PWB) of 40 patients and 30 controls were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In order to explore the effect of circRNA6783 on LA behavior, we overexpressed circRNA6783 in NCI-H1975 cells. The impact on the proliferation of tumor cells was then examined by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) assay, and the effects on apoptosis in the cell line were detected using flow cytometry.

Results
The expression levels of circRNA6783 were significantly higher in LA cell lines and PWB (P < 0.05). The diagnostic value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.830, with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 96.7%. In addition, functional experiments showed that overexpression of circRNA6783 restrained cell proliferation, significantly increased spontaneous apoptosis.

Conclusion
CircRNA6783 was upregulated in LA PWB. In vitro assessment demonstrated that circRNA6783 could act as a potential biomarker for LA diagnosis.",1
"Purpose: Urinary retention in women often presents a diagnostic difficulty, and
the etiology may remain unidentified even after excluding structural and neurological causes. We evaluated a group of women referred to a specialist center with
unexplained urinary retention.
Materials and Methods: A total of 61 consecutive women with complete urinary
retention were evaluated. Urological and neurological investigations locally had
failed to identify a cause. Urethral pressure profile, sphincter volume measurement and in some cases urethral sphincter electromyography were performed to
diagnose a primary disorder of sphincter relaxation (Fowler’s syndrome).
Results: Mean patient age was 39 years (range 18 to 88). Following investigations, a probable etiology was identified in 25 (41%) women, the most common
being Fowler’s syndrome. Of the women 24 (39%) were being treated with opiates
for various pain syndromes and in 13 no other cause of retention was identified.
Opiates could be discontinued in only 2 patients, and both demonstrated improved sensations and voiding.
Conclusions: The cause of urinary retention may remain unknown in spite of
extensive investigations. Young women regularly using prescription opiates for
various undiagnosed pain syndromes present a challenging clinical problem and
this study suggests that iatrogenic causes should be considered if voiding difficulties emerge. An association between opiate use and constipation is well-known
and, although urinary retention is a listed adverse event, it appears to be often
overlooked in clinical practice. It is hypothesized that Fowler’s syndrome is due to an
up-regulation of spinal cord enkephalins and that exogenous opiates may compound
any functional abnormalities predisposing young women to urinary retention.

"OBJECTIVE
During diabetes, retinal microglial cells are activated to release inflammatory cytokines that initiate neuronal loss and blood–retinal barrier breakdown seen in diabetic retinopathy (DR). The mechanism by which diabetes activates microglia to release those inflammatory mediators is unclear and was therefore elucidated.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Microglia activation was characterized in streptozocin-injected rats and in isolated microglial cells using immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses.

RESULTS
In 8-week diabetic retina, phospho-extracellular signal–related kinase (ERK) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases were localized in microglia, but not in Mueller cells or astrocytes. At the same time, Amadori-glycated albumin (AGA)-like epitopes were featured in the regions of microglia distribution, implicating a pathogenic effect on microglial activation. To test this, diabetic rats were treated intravitreally with A717, a specific AGA-neutralizing antibody, or murine IgG. Relative to nondiabetic rats, diabetic rats (IgG-treated) manifested 3.9- and 7.9-fold increases in Iba-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNAs, respectively. Treatment of diabetic rats with A717 significantly attenuated overexpression of these mRNAs. Intravitreal injection of AGA per se in normal rats resulted in increases of Iba-1 expression and TNF-α release. Guided by these results, a cultured retinal microglia model was developed to study microglial response after AGA treatment and the mechanistic basis behind this response. The results showed that formation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent activation of ERK and P38, but not Jun NH2-terminal kinase, are molecular events underpinning retinal microglial TNF-α release during AGA treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
These results provide new insights in understanding the pathogenesis of early DR, showing that the accumulated AGA within the diabetic retina elicits the microglial activation and secretion of TNF-α. Thus, intervention trials with agents that neutralize AGA effects may emerge as a new therapeutic approach to modulate early pathologic pathways long before the occurrence of vision loss among patients with diabetes.",1
"Abstract
While researchers with retracted papers – publications that are withdrawn because of significant errors or scientific misconduct – carry a permanent stain on their publishing records, understanding the causes and initiators of such retractions can shed a different light on the matter. This paper, based on a random sample of 2,046 retracted papers, which were published between 1975 and 2019, extracted from Retraction Watch and the websites of major publishers, shows that 53% of the retraction notices do not specify who initiated the retraction. Nearly 10% of the retraction notes either omit or do not contain information related to reasons for retractions. Furthermore, most of the retracted papers in our sample have no limitation section; those who do are commonly unhelpful or irrelevant. The results carry three implications for scientific transparency: retraction notices need to be more informative; limitation sections ought to be a required and even an open section of all published articles; and finally, promoting ‘heroic acts’ in science can positively change the current publishing culture.",1
"Abstract:Genome‐scale metabolic reconstructions can serve as important tools for hypothesis generation and high‐throughput data integration. Here, we present a metabolic network reconstruction and flux‐balance analysis (FBA) of Plasmodium falciparum, the primary agent of malaria. The compartmentalized metabolic network accounts for 1001 reactions and 616 metabolites. Enzyme–gene associations were established for 366 genes and 75% of all enzymatic reactions. Compared with other microbes, the P. falciparum metabolic network contains a relatively high number of essential genes, suggesting little redundancy of the parasite metabolism. The model was able to reproduce phenotypes of experimental gene knockout and drug inhibition assays with up to 90% accuracy. Moreover, using constraints based on gene‐expression data, the model was able to predict the direction of concentration changes for external metabolites with 70% accuracy. Using FBA of the reconstructed network, we identified 40 enzymatic drug targets (i.e. in silico essential genes), with no or very low sequence identity to human proteins. To demonstrate that the model can be used to make clinically relevant predictions, we experimentally tested one of the identified drug targets, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, using a recently discovered small‐molecule inhibitor.",1
"Abstract
Purpose
Frozen embryo transfer (FET) has no clear negative impact on neonatal outcome compared with fresh embryo transfer (ET) and appears to result in similar or even better neonatal outcome. The objective of this study was to compare early pregnancy outcome and neonatal health of children born after FET and fresh ET.

Methods
In this study early pregnancy and neonatal outcomes after FET (n = 200) and fresh ET (n = 500) were compared.

Results
For early pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy was comparable between FET and fresh ET groups. Spontaneous abortion was significantly higher in FET (14.5%) than fresh ET group (9%). Neonatal outcome was comparable between both groups except for lower live birth rate in FET (55%) versus fresh ET group (66%).

Conclusion
FET has similar neonatal outcome in terms of prematurity, low birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death and major malformation compared with fresh ET.",1
"SUMMARY
The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7/HAUSP regulates p53 and MDM2 levels, and cellular localization
of FOXO4 and PTEN, and hence is critically important
for their role in cellular processes. Here we show how
the 64 kDa C-terminal region of USP7 can positively
regulate deubiquitinating activity. We present the
crystal structure of this USP7/HAUSP ubiquitin-like
domain (HUBL) comprised of five ubiquitin-like (Ubl)
domains organized in 2-1-2 Ubl units. The last di-Ubl
unit, HUBL-45, is sufficient to activate USP7, through
binding to a ‘‘switching’’ loop in the catalytic domain,
which promotes ubiquitin binding and increases
activity 100-fold. This activation can be enhanced
allosterically by the metabolic enzyme GMPS. It
binds to the first three Ubl domains (HUBL-123) and
hyperactivates USP7 by stabilization of the HUBL45-dependent active state.",1

Background
Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin C, in the epithelial lining and lining fluids of the lung may be beneficial in the reduction of oxidative damage (Arab 2002). They may therefore be of benefit in reducing symptoms of inflammatory airway conditions such as asthma, and may also be beneficial in reducing exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction, which is a well‐recognised feature of asthma and is considered a marker of airways inflammation. However, the association between dietary antioxidants and asthma severity or exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction is not fully understood.

Objectives
To examine the effects of vitamin C supplementation on exacerbations and health‐related quality of life (HRQL) in adults and children with asthma or exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction compared to placebo or no vitamin C.

Search methods
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR). The Register contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of a number of bibliographic databases, and handsearching of journals and meeting abstracts. We also searched trial registry websites. The searches were conducted in December 2012.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included both adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma. In separate analyses we considered trials with a diagnosis of exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction (or exercise‐induced asthma). We included trials comparing vitamin C supplementation with placebo, or vitamin C supplementation with no supplementation. We included trials where the asthma management of both treatment and control groups provided similar background therapy. The primary focus of the review is on daily vitamin C supplementation to prevent exacerbations and improve HRQL. The short‐term use of vitamin C at the time of exacerbations or for cold symptoms in people with asthma are outside the scope of this review.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of potential studies, and subsequently screened full text study reports for inclusion. We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main results
A total of 11 trials with 419 participants met our inclusion criteria. In 10 studies the participants were adults and only one was in children. Reporting of study design was inadequate to determine risk of bias for most of the studies and poor availability of data for our key outcomes may indicate some selective outcome reporting. Four studies were parallel‐group and the remainder were cross‐over studies. Eight studies included people with asthma and three studies included 40 participants with exercise‐induced asthma. Five studies reported results using single‐dose regimes prior to bronchial challenges or exercise tests. There was marked heterogeneity in vitamin C dosage regimes used in the selected studies, compounding the difficulties in carrying out meaningful analyses.

One study on 201 adults with asthma reported no significant difference in our primary outcome, health‐related quality of life (HRQL), and overall the quality of this evidence was low. There were no data available to evaluate the effects of vitamin C supplementation on our other primary outcome, exacerbations in adults. One small study reported data on asthma exacerbations in children and there were no exacerbations in either the vitamin C or placebo groups (very low quality evidence). In another study conducted in 41 adults, exacerbations were not defined according to our criteria and the data were not available in a format suitable for evaluation by our methods. Lung function and symptoms data were contributed by single studies. We rated the quality of this evidence as moderate, but further research is required to assess any clinical implications that may be related to the changes in these parameters. In each of these outcomes there was no significant difference between vitamin C and placebo. No adverse events at all were reported; again this is very low quality evidence.

Studies in exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction suggested some improvement in lung function measures with vitamin C supplementation, but theses studies were few and very small, with limited data and we judged the quality of the evidence to be low.

Authors' conclusions
Currently, evidence is not available to provide a robust assessment on the use of vitamin C in the management of asthma or exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. There is no indication currently that vitamin C can be recommended as a therapeutic agent in asthma. There was some indication that vitamin C was helpful in exercise‐induced breathlessness in terms of lung function and symptoms; however, as these findings were provided only by small studies they are inconclusive. Most published studies to date are too small and inconsistent to provide guidance. Well‐designed trials with good quality clinical endpoints, such as exacerbation rates and health‐related quality of life scores, are required.",1
"Abstract
Many bacterial pathogens use quorum sensing (QS) to control virulence. As a result, the
development of methods to intercept QS has attracted significant interest as a potential antiinfective therapy. Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a pan-drug resistant pathogen and
displays a remarkable ability to persist in hospital settings despite desiccation and antimicrobial
treatment. Recent studies have shown that A. baumannii QS mutants have limited motility and fail
to form mature biofilms – these phenotypes are linked to its ability to persist on biotic and abiotic
surfaces and increase its pathogenicity. A. baumannii uses N-(3-hydroxydodecanoyl)-Lhomoserine lactone (OH-dDHL) and its putative cognate receptor, AbaR, for QS. We sought to
identify non-native ligands capable of blocking or promoting AbaR activity in A. baumannii for
use as chemical probes to modulate QS phenotypes in this pathogen. We screened a focused
library of synthetic, non-native N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to identify such compounds,
and several highly potent antagonists and agonists were uncovered, with IC50 and EC50 values in
the low micromolar range, respectively. The strongest AbaR antagonists largely contained
aromatic acyl groups, whereas the AbaR agonists closely resembled OH-dDHL. Notably, the 10
most potent AbaR antagonists also strongly inhibited A. baumannii motility, and five antagonists
reduced biofilm formation in A. baumannii by up to 40%. The discovery of these compounds is
significant, as they represent, to our knowledge, the first non-native modulators of QS in A.
baumannii to be reported and could find utility as new tools to study the role and timing of QS
phenotypes in A. baumannii infections.",1
"Abstract
Objective: Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is a short-term trauma-focused intervention originally developed for treating survivors of war and torture. The neurobiological theoretical foundations of NET would suggest that the approach should have long term beneficial effects. We tested this assumption and also provided an extensive overview of all NET studies for adults, for children (KIDNET), and for perpetrators (Forensic Offender Rehabilitation NET; FORNET).

Method: Following a systematic literature review, we conducted meta-analyses with all studies that had control conditions, and with all Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). We assessed between-groups short- (< 6 months) and long-term (≥ 6 months) effect sizes for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.

Results: In a total of 56 studies from 30 countries comparing 1370 participants treated with NET to 1055 controls, we found large between group effect sizes regarding the reduction of PTSD symptoms in favor of NET. Analyses of RCTs with active controls yielded small to medium effect sizes in the short-term, and large effect sizes in the long-term.

Conclusions: NET, KIDNET, and FORNET yield beneficial and sustainable treatment results for severely traumatized individuals living in adverse circumstances. Studies in highly developed health care systems comparing NET with other evidence-based trauma-focused interventions are needed.

Objective: 
In this analysis of the telehealth-based Vascular health ASsessment Of The hypertENSive patients Registry, we checked how 24-h central and peripheral hemodynamics compare with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD).

Methods: 
In 646 hypertensive patients (mean age 52 ± 16 years, 54% males, 65% treated) we obtained ambulatory brachial and central SBP and pulse pressure (PP), SBP, and PP variability, pulse wave velocity and augmentation index with a validated cuff-based technology. HMOD was defined by an increased left ventricular mass index (cardiac damage, evaluated in 482 patients), an increased intima–media thickness (vascular damage, n = 368), or a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate or increased urine albumin excretion (renal damage, n = 388).

Results: 
Ambulatory SBP and PPs were significantly associated with cardiac damage: the largest odds ratio was observed for 24-h central SBP [1.032 (1.012, 1.051), P = 0.001] and PP [1.042 (1.015, 1.069), P = 0.002], the weakest for brachial estimates. The association was less strong for vascular damage with a trend to the superiority of 24-h central [1.036 (0.997, 1.076), P = 0.070] over brachial PP [1.031 (1.000, 1.062), P = 0.052]. No statistically significant association was observed for renal damage. SBP and PP variabilities, pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were not associated with any form of HMOD. In the multivariate analysis, age was associated with any type of HMOD, whereas central SBP and PP were predictive of an increased risk of cardiac damage.

Conclusion: 
In hypertensive patients a variable association exists between peripheral and central hemodynamics and various types of HMOD, with the most predictive power being observed for central SBP and PP for cardiac damage.",1
"Abstract
Background
Asthma and iron deficiency are common conditions. Whether iron status affects the risk of
asthma is unclear.
Objective
To determine the relationship between iron status and asthma, lung function, and
pulmonary inflammation.
Methods
Relationships between measures of iron status (serum ferritin, serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and sTfR/log10ferritin (sTfR-F Index)) and asthma, lung function, and pulmonary inflammation were examined in women 20-49 years in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey. Logistic, linear, and quadratic regression models accounting for the survey design of NHANES were used to evaluate associations between iron status and asthmarelated outcomes and were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, smoking status, income, and BMI.
Results
Approximately 16% reported a lifetime history of asthma, 9% reported current asthma, and
5% reported a recent asthma episode/attack (n = 2906). Increased ferritin (iron stores) was
associated with decreased odds of lifetime asthma, current asthma, and asthma attacks/
episodes in the range of ferritin linearly correlated with iron stores (20-300ng/ml). The highest quintile of ferritin (>76 ng/ml) was also associated with a decreased odds of asthma.
Ferritin levels were not associated with FEV1. Increased values of the sTfR-F Index and
sTfR, indicating lower body iron and higher tissue iron need, respectively, were associated
with decreased FEV1, but neither was associated with asthma. None of the iron indices
were associated with FeNO.

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) have been widely used in various areas, and its potential tox-
icity has gained wide attention. However, the molecular mechanisms of multiple genes working together

in the TiO2 NP-induced splenic injury are not well understood. In the present study, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg
body weight TiO2 NPs were administered to the mice by intragastric administration for 90 consecutive
days, their immune capacity in the spleen as well as the gene-expressed characteristics in the mouse
damaged spleen were investigated using microarray assay. The findings showed that with increased
dose, TiO2 NP exposure resulted in the increases of spleen indices, immune dysfunction, and severe

macrophage infiltration as well as apoptosis in the spleen. Importantly, microarray data showed signifi-
cant alterations in the expressions of 1041 genes involved in immune/inflammatory responses, apoptosis,

oxidative stress, stress responses, metabolic processes, ion transport, signal transduction, cell prolifera-
tion/division, cytoskeleton and translation in the 10 mg/kg TiO2 NP-exposed spleen. Specifically, Cyp2e1,

"Movement variability is inherently present in natural behaviors. In recent years,
this source of information has been of great interest to motor control physiologists as it
constitutes a physical, quantifiable form of sensory feedback to aid in the planning and
execution of complex actions. In marked contrast, the psychological and psychiatric
arenas mainly rely on verbal descriptions and interpretations of behavior through
observation. Whether in the laboratory setting conducting basic science research, or in the
clinic diagnosing and evaluating patients, behavior has not been physically quantified
using proper statistical methods. Consequently, a large gap exists between the body’s
manifestations of mental states (whether normative or pathological) and their descriptions
(through observational inventories). This disconnect is partly responsible for a
disembodied approach in the psychological and neural sciences, whereby contributions of
the peripheral nervous system to central control, executive functions, and decision
making processes are poorly understood. 
iii
Furthermore, the present gap between mind and body interactions severely
impedes progress in translating basic scientific outcomes into clinical applications. How
can we transition from a psychological theorizing approach to better understand complex
behaviors in a more objective manner?
This dissertation introduces a novel, objective, statistical framework and motor
control paradigm that characterizes the stochastic signatures of movement variability
present in the continuous stream of natural behaviors. We characterize a new class of
movements that occurs largely beneath conscious awareness but are interminably present
in all complex behaviors. The moment-by-moment assessment of the continuous flow of
sensory-motor fluctuations is possible for goal-directed segments of complex actions,
(which researchers have focused on for decades), and this newly introduced class of
supplementary, goal-less movements. To illustrate these points, we present the
application of our statistical framework to perceptual tasks involving visual illusions, as
well as to the automatic detection of sensory-motor disruptions in individuals with
schizophrenia. Lastly, we discuss the potential impact our discoveries have on translating
basic science research into practical, societal applications. We conclude that analyses of
motor output variability can transform the way in which we currently conduct research,
determine clinical diagnoses, and administer therapeutic interventions in the social,
health, and neural sciences.",1
"Background: Ulinastatin has been prescribed to treat sepsis. However, there is doubt regarding the extent of any improvement in outcomes to guide future decision making.

Objectives: To evaluate the effects of ulinastatin on mortality and related outcomes in sepsis patients.

Methods: Thirteen randomized controlled trials and two prospective studies published before September 1, 2018, that included 1358 patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock were evaluated. The electronic databases searched in this study were PubMed, Medline, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for Chinese Technical Periodicals.

Results: Ulinastatin significantly decreased the all-cause mortality {odds ratio (OR) = 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.35, 0.66], p < 0.00001, I2 = 13%}, Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score {mean difference (MD) = -3.18, 95%CI [-4.01, -2.35], p < 0.00001, I2 = 33%, and reduced the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (OR = 0.3, 95% CI [0.18, 0.49], p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%). Ulinastatin also decreased the serum levels of IL-6 (MD = -53.00, 95% CI [-95.56, -10.05], p = 0.02), TNF-a MD = -53.05, 95%CI [-68.36, -37.73], p < 0.00001, and increased the serum levels of IL-10 (MD = 37.73, 95% CI [16.92, 58.54], p = 0.0004). Ulinastatin administration did not lead to any difference in the occurrence of adverse events.

Conclusions: Ulinastatin improved all-cause mortality and other related outcomes in patients with sepsis or septic shock. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ulinastatin may be an effective treatment for sepsis and septic shock.

"Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers and the treatment
options for this disease are limited and generally not effective. ROCK has been reported to
be highly expressed in many cancer types and its inhibitor Fasudil has shown anti-cancer
potential. However, its high toxicity and low solubility restrict its clinical application. Here, we
report that Fasudil is effective against HCC and that a liposomal formulation (Lip-Fasudil)
can enhance the anti-tumor effects of this drug both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, Fasudil
inhibited HCC cell growth with IC50 values of 0.025–0.04 μg/μL, with Lip-Fasudil showing
slightly improved cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 0.02–0.025 μg/μL. Cellular mechanistic
analysis indicated that Fasudil induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and that Lip-Fasudil enhanced this effect. Intriguingly, no apoptosis was detected in Fasudil- or Lip-Fasudiltreated HCC cells. In vivo, Fasudil inhibited the growth of HCC xenografts by 23% in nude
mice. However, Lip-fasudil exerted anti-tumor effects (57% tumor inhibition) that were superior to those of Fasudil and similar to those of Topotecan (66%). In addition, Lip-fasudil
resulted in an increased distribution of Fasudil in tumor tissues but a reduced distribution in
normal organs. In conclusion, our results proved that Fasudil has the potential to be used for
HCC treatment and that a liposomal formulation (Lip-Fasudil) could enhance anti-tumor efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity.",1
"RNA silencing is a conserved eukaryotic gene expression regulatory mechanism mediated by small RNAs. In
Caenorhabditis elegans, the accumulation of a distinct class of siRNAs synthesized by an RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) requires the PIR-1 phosphatase. However, the function of PIR-1 in RNAi has remained unclear.
Since mammals lack an analogous siRNA biogenesis pathway, an RNA silencing role for the mammalian PIR-1
homolog (dual specificity phosphatase 11 [DUSP11]) was unexpected. Here, we show that the RNA triphosphatase
activity of DUSP11 promotes the RNA silencing activity of viral microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcribed precursors. Our results demonstrate that DUSP11 converts the 5′ triphosphate of
miRNA precursors to a 5′ monophosphate, promoting loading of derivative 5p miRNAs into Argonaute proteins via a
Dicer-coupled 5′ monophosphate-dependent strand selection mechanism. This mechanistic insight supports a
likely shared function for PIR-1 in C. elegans. Furthermore, we show that DUSP11 modulates the 5′ end phosphate
group and/or steady-state level of several host RNAP III transcripts, including vault RNAs and Alu transcripts. This
study shows that steady-state levels of select noncoding RNAs are regulated by DUSP11 and defines a previously
unknown portal for small RNA-mediated silencing in mammals, revealing that DUSP11-dependent RNA silencing
activities are shared among diverse metazoans.",1
"Background: Increasing evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the occurrence and development of human cancers. LINC00460, a novel tumor-related
lncRNA, has been reported to be involved in several types of human malignancies. However, the
role of LINC00460 in gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear. The present study aimed at exploring
the biological role of LINC00460 in GC and illuminating the potential molecular mechanisms.
Methods: In this study, qRT-PCR, western blotting, MTT assay, and Transwell invasion assay
were used to conduct relevant experimental analysis.
Results: Here, we found that LINC00460 was highly expressed in GC tissues and cell lines.
Moreover, LINC00460 over-expression was found to promote GC cell proliferation, migration and
invasion, whereas LINC00460 down-regulation significantly inhibited these processes. Notably, we
confirmed that LINC00460 could up-regulate KDM2A expression by competitively binding to miR342-3p in GC cells. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of LINC00460 down-regulation on GC
cell proliferation, migration and invasion were partially reversed by a miR-342-3p inhibitor.
Conclusion: In summary, our findings provide evidence for LINC00460 as a potential therapeutic target in GC.

"Abstract—Quantum network coding with classical assistance
can transmit quantum information with fidelity one in errorfree quantum channels. However, the dependency on classical
network solutions leads to higher communication complexity
and transmission congestion over a large-scale network with
bottleneck channels. We find that certain types of quantum
operation are sufficient to support multiple unicast sessions over
the extended butterfly network. Furthermore, this construction
decouples classical communication (assisting decoding information) from classical network solution. Based on this design, we
propose an optimal protocol for this specific network, which
significantly reduces the communication cost.

A repertoire of transcription initiation factors engage the core promoter of mRNA genes to
recruit RNA polymerase (Pol) II to initiate transcription, yet their precise spatial organization
remains unclear. Using ChIP-exo, here we detail the interactions and genomic organization
of initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, and Pol II at mRNA genes and within CpG islands. We find
that when Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, TBP/TFIIB remain at the promoter. We show that TBP and TFIIB bound to the core promoter at two separate, resolvable
locations that coincided with sites of divergent transcription initiation. We also examine the
precise binding of TBP at Pol III transcribed tRNA genes. We find that TBP crosslinked to
tRNA genes in a similar manner as at Pol II transcribed genes. This comprehensive and
high resolution genome-wide detection of the initiation machinery produces a consolidated
view of transcription initiation events humans at Pol II coding and Pol III transcribed tRNA
genes.",1

Tars should be removed from biomass gasification systems so as not to damage or clog downstream pipes
or equipment. In this paper, lignite insoluble residue (LIR) after extraction of humic acids was used as the
support to prepare a nickel-loaded LIR (Ni/LIR) catalyst. This novel catalyst Ni/LIR was tested in steam
reforming of toluene as a model compound of biomass tar conducted in a laboratory-scale fixed bed
reactor. When compared to the reactions without catalyst or with Ni/Al2O3, Ni/LIR was confirmed as an
active catalyst for toluene conversion at a relatively low temperature of 900 K. The investigated
reforming parameters during the experiments in this research were selected as reaction temperature at a
range of 850e950 K, steam/carbon molar ratio at a range of 2e5 mol/mol, and a space velocity from 1696
to 3387 h_x0001_1
. It was concluded that, under optimum conditions, significant amount of syngas yields,
acceptable Ni/LIR consumption and more than 95% of toluene conversion can be obtained from the

Background: Histological status of axillary lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor in patients
receiving surgery for breast cancer (BC). Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (B) has rapidly replaced
axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and is now the standard of care for axillary staging in patients
with clinically node-negative (N0) operable BC. The aim of this study is to compare pretreatment lymphoscintigraphy with a post primary systemic treatment (PST) scan in order to reduce the false-negative
rates for SLNB.
Methods: In this single-institution study we considered 170 consecutive T2-4 N0-1 M0 BC patients
treated with anthracycline-based PST. At the time of incisional biopsy, we performed sentinel lymphatic
mapping. After PST, all patients repeated lymphoscintigraphy with the same methodology. During
definitive surgery we performed further sentinel lymphatic mapping, SLNB and ALND.
Results: The SLN was removed in 158/170 patients giving an identification rate of 92.9% (95% confidence
interval (CI) ¼ 88.0e96.3%) and a false-negative rate of 14.0% (95% CI ¼ 6.3e25.8%). SLNB revealed a
sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI ¼ 74.2e93.7%), an accuracy of 94.9% (95% CI ¼ 90.3e97.8%) and a negative
predictive value of 92.7% (95% CI ¼ 86.1e96.8%).
Conclusion: Identification rate, sensitivity and accuracy are in accordance with other studies on SLNB
after PST, even after clinically negative node conversion following PST. This study confirms that diagnostic biopsy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy maintain breast lymphatic drainage unaltered.",1

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for solid pancreatic lesions has high diagnostic yield. However, few prospective multicenter studies have been performed. We performed a prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EUS-FNA for diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions.

Methods
This prospective cohort study involved five hospitals in Japan. The primary outcome was sensitivity of EUS-FNA for diagnosing malignant lesions. We also evaluated parameters of diagnostic sufficiency and the safety of EUS-FNA.

Results
In total, 246 patients were enrolled. The absolute values of the parameters evaluated showed no significant differences; however, the percentage changes in the white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels after examination were significantly higher, and the percentage change in hemoglobin concentrations was significantly lower. The minor and major complication rates at the time of puncture, 24 h, 7 days and 28 days were 4.1%, 2.8%, 1.6%, and 0.0%, respectively. The true complication rate was 1.2%. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 97.2%, 88.0%, 96.2%, 100%, and 81.4%, respectively.

Conclusions
EUS-FNA for solid pancreatic lesions has high diagnostic yield and is safe, consistent with previously studies.",1

Obesity is a medical situation in which excess body fat has gathered because of imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In spite of the fact that the variety of studies are available for obesity treatment and management, its “globesity” still remains a big challenge all over the world. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of effective herbal medicines in the management and treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome in human. We systematically searched all relevant clinical trials via Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and the Cochrane database to assess the effects of raw or refined products derived from plants or parts of plants on obesity and metabolic syndrome in overweight and obesity adult subjects. All studies conducted by the end of May 2019 were considered in the systematic review. Data were extracted independently by two experts. The quality assessment was assessed using Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist. The main outcomes were anthropometric indices and metabolic syndrome components. Pooled effect of herbal medicines on obesity and metabolic syndrome were presented as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 279 relevant clinical trials were included. Herbals containing green tea, Phaseolus vulgaris, Garcinia cambogia, Nigella sativa, puerh tea, Irvingia gabonensis, and Caralluma fimbriata and their active ingredients were found to be effective in the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In addition, C. fimbriata, flaxseed, spinach, and fenugreek were able to reduce appetite.

Meta-analysis showed that intake of green tea resulted in a significant improvement in weight ([SMD]: −0.75 [−1.18, −0.319]), body mass index ([SMD]: −1.2 [−1.82, −0.57]), waist circumference ([SMD]: −1.71 [−2.66, −0.77]), hip circumference ([SMD]: −0.42 [−1.02, −0.19]), and total cholesterol, ([SMD]: −0.43 [−0.77, −0.09]). In addition, the intake of P. vulgaris and N. sativa resulted in a significant improvement in weight ([SMD]: −0.88, 95 % CI: [−1.13, −0.63]) and triglyceride ([SMD]: −1.67, 95 % CI: [−2.54, −0.79]), respectively. High quality trials are still needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of the plants in obesity and metabolic syndrome.",1
"Abstract: TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have been demonstrated to suppress
25 spermatogenesis in animals, while little data related to the biochemical dysfunctions
26 during spermatogenesis due to exposure to TiO2 NPs. In this study, male mice have
27 been exposed to TiO2 NPs via intragastric administration for 60 consecutive days. The
28 findings showed that TiO2 NPs exposure resulted in lesions of testis and epididymis,
29 deductions in sperm concentration and sperm motility, and an increase of the number
30 of abnormal sperms in mice. Furthermore, TiO2 NPs exposure with 2.5, 5, or 10
31 mg/kgbw decreased activities of lactate dehydrogenase (-11.59% to -39.84%), sorbitol
32 dehydrogenase (-23.56% to -57.33%), succinate dehydrogenase(-27.04% to -57.85%),
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (-28.3% to -56.42%), Na+

to -53.11%), Ca2+-ATPase (-12.44% to -55.41%), and Ca2+/Mg2+ 34 -ATPase (-28.25% to
35 -65.72%), and elevated activities of acid phosphatase (+10.48% to +40.0%), alkaline
36 phosphatase (+20.65% to +64.07%), and total nitric oxide synthase (+0.68- to
37 +2.3-fold) in the testes of mice, respectively. In addition, TiO2 NPs exposure caused
38 excessive production of reactive oxygen species (+16.15% to +110.62%), and
39 increased malondialdehyde of lipid peroxidation product (+38.96% to +118.07%),
40 carbonyl of protein oxidative product (+20.98% to +108.1%) and 8-hydroxy
41 deoxyguanosine of DNA oxidative product (+0.9- to +1.83-fold) in the testes,
42 respectively. It implied that spermatogenesis suppression caused by TiO2 NPs
43 exposure may be associated with alterations of testicular marked enzymes and
44 oxidative stress in the testes.

"Abstract
Background
Skin barrier functions develop after birth and may be related to skin disorders in infants. We aimed to assess associations between dynamic trends of four skin barrier functional parameters in early life with infant atopic dermatitis (AD).

Methods
Based on the prospective cohort MKNFOAD (NCT02889081), we examined transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration (SCH), skin pH, and sebum content at five anatomical sites (cheek, forehead, forearm, abdomen, and lower leg) in 418 term infants at birth, 42 days, and 6 months. Trend differences by sex and association with AD at age 1 year were tested using variance analyses. Associations of the parameters with AD risk were tested using discrete time survival analysis, adjusting extensive covariates including parental history of allergy, infant’s sex, birth weight (kg), and delivery mode. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were reported.

Results
Overall TEWL and SCH appeared trends of increase while skin surface pH and sebum content showed trends of decrease within the first six postnatal months. Sex differences were significant for sebum content only (p < 0.001). After adjustment for parental and children covariates, cheek TEWL at birth (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.00–1.57, p = 0.045) and 42 days (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.17–1.97, p = 0.002) were significantly associated with increased AD risk. Associations were not observed between SCH, skin pH, and sebum content at birth or 42 days with AD.

Conclusions
Skin barrier functions of Chinese term infants varied nonlinearly after birth. Higher postnatal TEWL levels in early life indicate higher risk of early-onset AD.",1

The objective of the current study was to systematically review the evidence of the effect of secular
mindfulness techniques on function and structure of the brain. Based on areas known from traditional
meditation neuroimaging results, we aimed to explore a neuronal explanation of the stress-reducing
effects of the 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive
Therapy (MBCT) program.
Methods: We assessed the effect of MBSR and MBCT (N = 11, all MBSR), components of the programs
(N = 15), and dispositional mindfulness (N = 4) on brain function and/or structure as assessed by
(functional) magnetic resonance imaging. 21 fMRI studies and seven MRI studies were included (two
studies performed both).
Results: The prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the insula and the hippocampus showed increased
activity, connectivity and volume in stressed, anxious and healthy participants. Additionally, the
amygdala showed decreased functional activity, improved functional connectivity with the prefrontal
cortex, and earlier deactivation after exposure to emotional stimuli.
Conclusion: Demonstrable functional and structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex,
insula and hippocampus are similar to changes described in studies on traditional meditation practice.
In addition, MBSR led to changes in the amygdala consistent with improved emotion regulation. These
findings indicate that MBSR-induced emotional and behavioral changes are related to functional and
structural changes in the brain.",1
"Abstract
Background:
The purpose of this review is to evaluate the data on the use of antipsychotics in individuals with dementia from meta-analyses.
Methods:
We performed a literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane collaboration databases through 30 November, 2015 using the following keywords: ‘antipsychotics’, ‘dementia’ and ‘meta-analysis’. The search was not restricted by the age of the patients or the language of the study. However, in the final analysis we only included studies involving patients that were published in English language journals or had official English translations. In addition, we reviewed the bibliographic databases of published articles for additional studies.
Results:
This systematic review of the literature identified a total of 16 meta-analyses that evaluated the use of antipsychotics in individuals with dementia. Overall, 12 meta-analyses evaluated the efficacy of antipsychotics among individuals with dementia. Of these, eight also assessed adverse effects. A further two studies evaluated the adverse effects of antipsychotics (i.e. death). A total of two meta-analyses evaluated the discontinuation of antipsychotics in individuals with dementia. Overall, three meta-analyses were conducted in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) whereas one focused on individuals with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). The rest of the 12 meta-analyses included individuals with dementia.
Conclusions:
Antipsychotics have demonstrated modest efficacy in treating psychosis, aggression and agitation in individuals with dementia. Their use in individuals with dementia is often limited by their adverse effect profile. The use of antipsychotics should be reserved for severe symptoms that have failed to respond adequately to nonpharmacological management strategies.",1
"Background and aims: Controversy remains regarding the prediction effects of different adiposity measure indicators for the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our study aimed to assess the associations of three traditional anthropometric indicators, namely, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body mass index (BMI) as well as three non-traditional anthropometric indicators, namely, the Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and body shape index (ABSI), with the risk of CVD among Southwest Chinese population.

Methods: Our study was based on the Guizhou Population Health Cohort Study (GPHCS) conducted from 2010 to 2020. A total of 9,280 participants were recruited from 12 areas in Guizhou Province, China, from November 2010 to December 2012, and followed up for major chronic diseases until December 2020. A total of 7,837 individuals with valid data were included in this analysis. The gender-specific associations of WC, WHtR, BMI, CVAI, LAP, and ABSI with CVD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the prediction powers of different indicators for CVD.

Results: No association of six indicators with CVD was observed among male participants. Female participants with either WC-based central obesity (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.12–2.97) or WHtR-based central obesity (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.07–2.64) had a higher risk of CVD, after adjusted for age, area, ethnic group, smoking, alcohol drinking, MET, previous history of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, medication use, and nutraceutical intake. Compared with female participants in the lowest quartile (Q1), those in the highest quartile (Q4) of WHtR (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.17–4.27), CVAI (HR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.87–8.49), and ABSI (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.06–3.52) had an increased risk for incident CVD. CAVI showed the maximum predictive power of CVD with the biggest AUC of 0.687 (95% CI: 0.654–0.720) compared to other indicators in female participants.

Conclusions: Visceral adiposity measures, especially CVAI, are stronger predictive indicators of CVD among female and not male participants in Southwest China. Different anthropometric indexes need to be combined to comprehensively assess health risks.",1

Background
Although school garden programs have been shown to improve dietary behaviors, there has not been a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted to examine the effects of school garden programs on obesity or other health outcomes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a one-year school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking intervention (called Texas Sprouts) on dietary intake, obesity outcomes, and blood pressure in elementary school children.

Methods
This study was a school-based cluster RCT with 16 elementary schools that were randomly assigned to either the Texas Sprouts intervention (n = 8 schools) or to control (delayed intervention, n = 8 schools). The intervention was one school year long (9 months) and consisted of: a) Garden Leadership Committee formation; b) a 0.25-acre outdoor teaching garden; c) 18 student gardening, nutrition, and cooking lessons taught by trained educators throughout the school-year; and d) nine monthly parent lessons. The delayed intervention was implemented the following academic year and received the same protocol as the intervention arm. Child outcomes measured were anthropometrics (i.e., BMI parameters, waist circumference, and body fat percentage via bioelectrical impedance), blood pressure, and dietary intake (i.e., vegetable, fruit, and sugar sweetened beverages) via survey. Data were analyzed with complete cases and with imputations at random. Generalized weighted linear mixed models were used to test the intervention effects and to account for clustering effect of sampling by school.

Results
A total of 3135 children were enrolled in the study (intervention n = 1412, 45%). Average age was 9.2 years, 64% Hispanic, 47% male, and 69% eligible for free and reduced lunch. The intervention compared to control resulted in increased vegetable intake (+ 0.48 vs. + 0.04 frequency/day, p = 0.02). There were no effects of the intervention compared to control on fruit intake, sugar sweetened beverages, any of the obesity measures or blood pressure.

Conclusion
While this school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking program did not reduce obesity markers or blood pressure, it did result in increased vegetable intake. It is possible that a longer and more sustained effect of increased vegetable intake is needed to lead to reductions in obesity markers and blood pressure.",1
"Abstract
Introduction and hypothesis
The treatment and mental support of patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome are very important. Many of these patients seek treatment to improve their sexual relationships and the quality of their sexual life. This systematic review sought to evaluate the sexual satisfaction of patients with MRKH syndrome following various types of vaginoplasty and non-surgical procedures over the past 10 years.

Methods
A systematic review of studies published in English during 2008–2018 was performed. Electronic databases and valid sites, including PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Ovid, and ProQuest, were searched for articles published from the beginning of 2008 to February 2018. Literature restricted to women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome who underwent vaginoplasty surgery or a non-surgical technique was reviewed. Of 195 papers identified, 45 articles were analyzed. All studies that reported sexual and functional outcomes following various vaginoplasty procedures and non-surgical procedures were selected.

Results
Greater vaginal length and higher sexual satisfaction were observed following surgical procedures than after non-surgical techniques. A range of complications was reported following the use of different surgical approaches. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was the most commonly applied tool to measure sexual satisfaction, but its results were not always in agreement with the findings of other research tools. Finally, women who underwent surgical techniques had higher sexual activity levels than those who received non-surgical procedures.

Conclusion
The reviewed studies highlighted the need for further quantitative and qualitative research on the sexual performance and outcomes of patients with MRKH syndrome.",1
"ABSTRACT
Ulam is the South East Asian traditional vegetables which contains high total phenolic content and exhibits antioxidant
activity. Several studies have reported the potential of neuroprotective effect of ulam. The objective of this review article
was to highlight the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of ulam and the roles of phenolic content that
can contribute to attenuation of cognitive decline. The review includes randomized controlled trial and experimental
studies from year 2007 to 2017. In this review, PRISMA method was used to report the results (n=15). Phenolic compounds,
ie plants’ second metabolites of selected ulam in South East Asia were also discussed in this review, with respect to its
potential for health promotion which and reducing the risk of cognitive disease. Oenanthe javanica (selom), Ocimum
basilicum (daun selasih) and Anacardium occidentale L. (pucuk gajus) were ranked in the top three highest TPC among
all the selected ulam. In general, Polygonum minus (kesum), Anacardium occidentale L. (pucuk gajus) and Cosmos
caudatus (ulam raja) exhibited high DPPH radical scavenging activity whereas Anacardium occidentale L. (pucuk gajus)
exhibited highest ferric ion reducing potential (FRAP) among all the selected ulam in South East Asia countries. Overall,
some studies had shown Centella asiatica (pegaga), Oenanthe javanica (selom), Polygonum minus (kesum), Ocimum
basilicum (daun selasih) and Murraya koenigii (daun kari) are beneficial in improving cognitive status and mood. The
bioactive compounds in ulam may exhibit neuroprotective effects but human studies are still lacking in exploring the
relationship between ulam consumption and cognitive status.

"Abstract
Peptic ulcers are characterized by erosions on the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract that may reach the muscle layer. Their etiology is multifactorial and occurs when the balance between offensive and protective factors of the mucosa is disturbed. Peptic ulcers represent a global health problem, affecting millions of people worldwide and showing high rates of recurrence. Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most important predisposing factors for the development of peptic ulcers. Therefore, new approaches to complementary treatments are needed to prevent the development of ulcers and their recurrence. Natural products such as medicinal plants and their isolated compounds have been widely used in experimental models of peptic ulcers. Flavonoids are among the molecules of greatest interest in biological assays due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study is a literature review of flavonoids that have been reported to show peptic ulcer activity in experimental models. Studies published from January 2010 to January 2020 were selected from reference databases. This review refers to a collection of flavonoids with antiulcer activity in vivo and in vitro models.

44 Background & Aims: Oral feeding intolerance (OFI) is a common complication of acute
45 pancreatitis that leads to prolonged hospitalisation, increased use of hospital resources, and
46 impaired quality of life. Currently, there are no clinically useful predictors of OFI. The aims of
47 this study were to determine whether gastrointestinal dysmotility is associated with the
48 development of OFI, and whether the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) can be
49 utilised as a predictive tool in a clinical setting.
50
51 Methods: The study design was a prospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the
52 development of OFI. Daily GCSI total score and sub-scores (nausea/vomiting, early satiety and
53 bloating) were recorded. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were
54 conducted, adjusting for age, aetiology of pancreatitis, severity, diabetes status, and time from
55 symptom onset to hospital admission.
56
57 Results: A total of 217 consecutive adult patients with acute pancreatitis participated in this
58 study. Multivariate analyses showed significant associations between OFI occurrence and the
59 total GCSI score on day 2 of hospital admission (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-2.00), the highest total
60 GCSI score (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03-1.86), the day 2 nausea/vomiting sub-score (OR 1.40, 95%
61 CI 1.04-1.89), the day 2 bloating sub-score (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.54), and the highest
62 bloating sub-score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.63).
63
64 Conclusions: Gastrointestinal dysmotility is associated with the development of OFI and the
65 GCSI has potential as a clinically useful predictive tool in the setting of acute pancreatitis. The
66 developed nomogram holds promise but needs to be validated externally.

Objectives
To construct a valid and reliable Nutritional Literacy Scale for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving dialysis and evaluate associations between nutrition literacy and quality of life.

Methods
A total of 208 ESKD patients receiving dialysis were selected for this study. Nutrition literacy evaluation items were drafted based on dietary guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD), Literature reviews and expert consultation. Scale reliability and validity were then assessed. Factors influencing nutrition literacy and the associations among nutrition literacy, nutritional status, and quality of life were evaluated.

Results
The scale consists of 28 items with a scale-level content validity index of 0.91 and item-level content validity indices ranging from 0.83 to 1.00. Factor analysis identified 4 common factors (dimensions) named nutrition knowledge, cognitive attitude, behavioral practice, and information acquisition ability that collectively explained 56.31% of literacy score variation. The overall Cronbach’s α coefficient of the scale was 0.83, the dimensional Cronbach’s α coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.87, and the retest reliability was r = 0.73 (p < 0.05). Age, education level, residence (urban vs. Rural), occupational status and dialysis modalities were significant factors influencing nutrition literacy. Nutrition literacy score was negatively correlated with SGA score and positively correlated with serum albumin and prealbumin concen- trations, and with SF-36 quality of life score (all p < 0.05).

Conclusions
This new Nutrition Literacy Scale demonstrates high reliability and validity for Chinese ESKD patients undergoing dialysis. The nutrition literacy is influenced by age, education level, residence, occupational status and dialysis modalities, associated not only with nutritional status but also with quality of life.",1
"Background
Symptomatic breakthrough in proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-treated gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients is a common problem with a range of underlying causes. The nonsystemic, raft-forming action of alginates may help resolve symptoms.

Aim
To assess alginate-antacid (Gaviscon Double Action, RB, Slough, UK) as add-on therapy to once-daily PPI for suppression of breakthrough reflux symptoms.

Methods
In two randomised, double-blind studies (exploratory, n=52; confirmatory, n=262), patients taking standard-dose PPI who had breakthrough symptoms, assessed by Heartburn Reflux Dyspepsia Questionnaire (HRDQ), were randomised to add-on Gaviscon or placebo (20 mL after meals and bedtime). The exploratory study endpoint was change in HRDQ score during treatment vs run-in. The confirmatory study endpoint was “response” defined as ≥3 days reduction in the number of “bad” days (HRDQ [heartburn/regurgitation] >0.70) during treatment vs run-in.

Results
In the exploratory study, significantly greater reductions in HRDQ scores (heartburn/regurgitation) were observed in the Gaviscon vs placebo (least squares mean difference [95% CI] −2.10 [−3.71 to −0.48]; P=.012). Post hoc “responder” analysis of the exploratory study also revealed significantly more Gaviscon patients (75%) achieved ≥3 days reduction in “bad” days vs placebo patients (36%), P=.005. In the confirmatory study, symptomatic improvement was observed with add-on Gaviscon (51%) but there was no significant difference in response vs placebo (48%) (OR (95% CI) 1.15 (0.69-1.91), P=.5939).

Conclusions
Adding Gaviscon to PPI reduced breakthrough GERD symptoms but a nearly equal response was observed for placebo. Response to intervention may vary according to whether symptoms are functional in origin.",1

Background
Vaccination has been suggested to be involved in the aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). HPV vaccine was introduced in the Norwegian Childhood Immunisation Programme and offered 12 year old girls from 2009. We studied the association between HPV vaccination and risk of CFS/ME and also assessed medical history in relation to both risk of CFS/ME and HPV vaccine uptake.
Methods
Individual data from national registries, including the Norwegian Population Registry, the Norwegian Patient Registry and the Norwegian Immunisation Registry were linked using the unique personal identification number. Yearly incidence rates of CFS/ME for 2009–2014 were calculated among the 824,133 boys and girls, aged 10–17 living in Norway during these 6 years. A total of 176,453 girls born 1997–2002 were eligible for HPV vaccination and included in further analyses. Hazard ratios (HRs) of CFS/ME were estimated using Cox regression. Risk differences (RDs) of vaccine uptake were estimated with binomial regression.
Results
A similar yearly increase in incidence rate of CFS/ME was observed among girls and boys, IRR = 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.19) and 1.15 (95% CI 1.09–1.22), respectively. HPV vaccination was not associated with CFS/ME, HR = 0.86 (95% CI 0.69–1.08) for the entire follow-up period and 0.96 (95% CI 0.64–1.43) for the first two years after vaccination. The risk of CFS/ME increased with increasing number of previous hospital contacts, HR = 5.23 (95% CI 3.66–7.49) for 7 or more contacts as compared to no contacts. Girls with 7 or more hospital contacts were less likely to be vaccinated than girls with no previous hospital contacts, RD = −5.5% (95% CI −6.7% to −4.2%).
Conclusions
No indication of increased risk of CFS/ME following HPV vaccination was observed among girls in the first 6 birth cohorts offered HPV vaccine through the national immunisation programme in Norway.",1
"ABSTRACT
Recent research carried out in the Serranía La Lindosa (Department of Guaviare) provides archaeological evidence of the colonisation of the northwest Colombian Amazon during the Late Pleistocene. Preliminary excavations were conducted at Cerro Azul, Limoncillos and Cerro Montoya archaeological sites in Guaviare
Department, Colombia. Contemporary dates at the three separate rock shelters establish initial colonisation of
the region between ~12,600 and ~11,800 cal BP. The contexts also yielded thousands of remains of fauna, flora,
lithic artefacts and mineral pigments, associated with extensive and spectacular rock pictographs that adorn the
rock shelter walls. This article presents the first data from the region, dating the timing of colonisation, describing subsistence strategies, and examines human adaptation to these transitioning landscapes. The results
increase our understanding of the global expansion of human populations, enabling assessment of key interactions between people and the environment that appear to have lasting repercussions for one of the most
important and biologically diverse ecosystems in the world.",1

Background/Aims: Recent studies have indicated that exosomes secreted from adiposederived stem cells (ADSCs) have important effects in the treatment of ischemic injury. However,
the treatment mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether ADSC-derived
exosomes enriched with microRNA (miR)-30d-5p have a protective effect on acute ischemic
stroke (AIS). Methods: In the current study, inflammatory factors and miR-30d-5p expression
were assessed in 70 subjects with AIS and 35 healthy controls. Exosomes were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy and further examined using nanoparticle tracking
analyses. A rat model of AIS and an in vitro model of oxygen- and glucose-deprived (OGD)
primary microglia were established to study the protective mechanism of exosomes from
miR-30d-5p-overexpressing ADSCs in ischemia-induced nerve injury. Results: The results
showed that following AIS, the expression of inflammatory cytokines increased, while the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and miR-30d-5p decreased both in patients and in animal
models. Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that suppression of autophagy significantly
reduced the OGD-induced inflammatory response. In addition, exosome treatment was
more effective in suppressing the inflammatory response by reversing OGD-induced and

"Abstract
Aims
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). For both, CKD and CAD, the intercellular transfer of microRNAs (miRs) through extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an important factor of disease development. Whether the combination of CAD and CKD affects endothelial function through cellular crosstalk of EV-incorporated miRs is still unknown.

Methods and results
Out of 172 screened CAD patients, 31 patients with CAD + CKD were identified and matched with 31 CAD patients without CKD. Additionally, 13 controls without CAD and CKD were included. Large EVs from CAD + CKD patients contained significantly lower levels of the vasculo-protective miR-130a-3p and miR-126-3p compared to CAD patients and controls. Flow cytometric analysis of plasma-derived EVs revealed significantly higher numbers of endothelial cell-derived EVs in CAD and CAD + CKD patients compared to controls. EVs from CAD + CKD patients impaired target human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) proliferation upon incubation in vitro. Consistent with the clinical data, treatment with the uraemia toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS)-reduced miR-130a-3p levels in HCAEC-derived EVs. EVs from IS-treated donor HCAECs-reduced proliferation and re-endothelialization in EV-recipient cells and induced an anti-angiogenic gene expression profile. In a mouse-experiment, intravenous treatment with EVs from IS-treated endothelial cells significantly impaired endothelial regeneration. On the molecular level, we found that IS leads to an up-regulation of the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU), which retains miR-130a-3p in the cell leading to reduced vesicular miR-130a-3p export and impaired EV-recipient cell proliferation.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest that EV-miR-mediated vascular intercellular communication is altered in patients with CAD and CKD, promoting CKD-induced endothelial dysfunction.",1

This study aims to explore the conscious fantasies about the unborn baby among women experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum and identify possible clinical implications. Fourteen inpatient
women with moderate to severe symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum and between the 12
and 14 weeks gestation participated in semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the transcripts
revealed escape and aggression fantasies about the baby, denial of fantasies in the categories
tested (name, sex, external and internal characteristics of the baby), freezing of the maternalfetus bond, and ambivalence toward the continuation of the pregnancy. Neither the severity of
symptoms nor the stated quality of life mediated the results. These findings suggest that the
discussion and reframing of fantasies can be proven helpful and relieving for the women facing
any pregnancy complication. Toward achieving a multidisciplinary approach, the variable of fantasy should be considered among others.",1
"Abstract
Although the spliceogenic nature of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A variant has been demonstrated, its association with cancer risk remains controversial. In this study, we accurately quantified by real-time PCR and digital PCR (dPCR), the BRCA2 isoforms retaining or missing exon 3. In addition, the combined odds ratio for causality of the variant was estimated using genetic and clinical data, and its associated cancer risk was estimated by case-control analysis in 83,636 individuals. Co-occurrence in trans with pathogenic BRCA2 variants was assessed in 5,382 families. Exon 3 exclusion rate was 4.5-fold higher in variant carriers (13%) than controls (3%), indicating an exclusion rate for the c.68-7T > A allele of approximately 20%. The posterior probability of pathogenicity was 7.44 × 10−115. There was neither evidence for increased risk of breast cancer (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.86–1.24) nor for a deleterious effect of the variant when co-occurring with pathogenic variants. Our data provide for the first time robust evidence of the nonpathogenicity of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A. Genetic and quantitative transcript analyses together inform the threshold for the ratio between functional and altered BRCA2 isoforms compatible with normal cell function. These findings might be exploited to assess the relevance for cancer risk of other BRCA2 spliceogenic variants.",1

Objective
To gain more insight into the dynamics of lymphocyte depletion and develop new predictors of clinical response to rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods
RNA-based next-generation sequencing was used to analyse the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in peripheral blood and synovial tissue samples collected from 24 seropositive patients with RA treated with rituximab. Clonal expansion, mutation load and clonal overlap were assessed in samples collected before, at week 4 and at week 16 or 24 after treatment and correlated to the patients' clinical response.
Results
After 4 weeks of rituximab-induced B cell depletion, the peripheral blood BCR repertoire of treated patients consisted of fewer, more dominant and more mutated BCR clones. No significant changes in the synovial tissue BCR repertoire were detected until week 16 post-treatment, when a reduced clonal overlap with baseline and an increased mutation load were observed. In patients who were non-responders at month 3 (n=5) using the European League Against Rheumatism response criteria, peripheral blood samples taken at week 4 after rituximab treatment showed more dominant clones compared with moderate responders (n=9) (median (IQR): 36 (27–52) vs 18 (16–26); p<0.01) and more clonal overlap with the baseline (median (IQR): 5% (2%–20%) vs 0% (0%–0%); p≤0.01).
Conclusion
Significant changes in BCR clonality are observed in peripheral blood of patients 4 weeks after rituximab treatment, while changes in synovial tissue were observed at later time points. Incomplete depletion of the dominant baseline peripheral blood BCR repertoire in the first month of treatment might predict clinical non-response at 3 months.",1
"Abstract
Background: Claudin 4 is one of the tight junction proteins
which considered one of the protective barriers that are mostly
involved in the regulation of intercellular communication,
paracellular transport and apical cell-to-cell adhesion. Overexpression of COX-2 and subsequent increase in prostaglandins
(PGs) concentration have emerged in recent years as important
players in cancer progression.
Aim of Study: To explore immunohisto chemically the
expression of both claudin-4 and COX2 in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma and correlate their expression with each other and
with different clinicopathological parameters.
Material and Methods: This retrospective study was done
upon formalin fixed, paraffin blocks of 32 nasopharngeal
carcinoma cases and 6 non-neoplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium. The materials were obtained from archieves of Pathology
Departement and Early Cancer Detection Unit (ECDU),
Faculty of Medicine, Benha University during the years 2012-
2017. The immunohistochemical stain with Claudin 4 and
COX2 was done and evaluated for each case.
Results: High expression of claudin 4 was observed in
44% of studied nasopharyngeal cases with statistically significant correlation with tumor stage and distant metastasis
(p<0.05). Positive expression of COX2 was detected in 75%
of neoplastic group and statistically correlated with depth of
tumor invasion, nodal invasion and tumor stage (p<0.05). A
statistically significant correlation was detected between
overexpression of COX2 and low expression of claudin4 in
the studied neoplastic cases (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Claudin -4 has different tumorigenic effects
besides their known adhesion attributes. Because of that, we
believe that claudin 4 with other clinicopahological parameters
may be a promising prognostic molecular indicator in nasopharyngeal cancer cases and can be taken as a novel biomarker for the predication of distant metastasis and survival.
This work also highlights COX-2 expression's potential as an
indicator of cancer progression that can contribute to assessment of prognosis and treatment decisions. Therefore, COX -
2inhibitors may have considerable potential as therapeutic
agents. ",1
"Cellular adaptation to excess iron (Fe) is a major determinant to protect tissues from toxicity. The
adaptation of hepatoma cell lines following exposure to toxic levels of Fe compounds was studied.
A dose- and time-dependent induction of toxicity was observed that was strictly compound-specific.
Similar ranging orders of toxicity, i.e. iron chloride 4iron sulfate 4iron citrate, were observed in four
human hepatoma cell lines. Long-term cultivation of HepG2 cells in 10 mM iron citrate resulted in a
resistant cell line that displayed high proliferation rates for several months. Resistant cells showed
increased viability at iron citrate concentrations ranging from 5–15 mM, while exposition to iron chloride
or iron sulfate induced high rates of toxicity similar to parental cells. Resistance was not due to
decreased Fe uptake/storage since high intracellular Fe levels were observed. A broad range of
modulated gene expression was associated with short- and long-term iron citrate exposition; however,
after weaning of resistant cells, re-exposition to Fe induced a similar level of toxicity as observed in
parental cells suggesting that a transient adaptation of gene expression was mounted. The results
indicate that, depending on the nature of the Fe compound, a specific level of toxicity is induced in
hepatic cells which however can be overcome by establishment of resistance.",1

Background:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with an increased risk of developing several common cancers, but it is unclear whether this association is causal. We aimed to summarize the evidence on T2DM and cancer and evaluate the validity of associations from both observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.

Methods:
We performed an umbrella review of the evidence across meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations of T2DM with risk of developing or dying from site-specific cancers, and MR studies that explored the potential causal association of T2DM and associated biomarkers with cancer risk.

Results:
We identified eligible observational meta-analyses that assessed associations between T2DM and cancer incidence for 18 cancer sites, cancer mortality for seven sites, and cancer incidence or mortality for four sites. Positive associations between T2DM and six cancers reached strong or highly suggestive evidence. We found eight MR studies assessing the association of genetically predicted T2DM and seven and eight studies assessing the association of genetically predicted fasting insulin or fasting glucose concentrations, respectively, upon site-specific cancers. Positive associations were found between genetically predicted T2DM and fasting insulin and risk of six cancers. There was no association between genetically predicted fasting plasma glucose and cancer except for squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Conclusions:
We found robust observational evidence for the association between T2DM and colorectal, hepatocellular, gallbladder, breast, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers.",1

Objective: To explore the biomechanical differences between Coflex and X-STOP devices by finite element analysis. Methods: Based on the normal lumbar CT images from a healthy adult volunteer, four finite element models including the healthy lumbar segment model, the mild degenerated lumbar segment model, a Coflex fixed lumbar segment model and X-STOP fixed lumbar segment model were constructed. A simulation analysis under the conditions of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation was performed to compare range of motion (ROM), intradiscal pressure, the facet joint force, the maximum Von Mises stress and the peak facet contact forces, between Coflex and X-STOP devices. Results: Compared to the mild degenerated lumbar segment model at surgical level L4-L5, Coflex and X-STOP could reduce ROM in extension by 98.34% and 95.86%, respectively, decrease peak stress of intervertebral discs in extension by 59.4% and 66.17%, respectively, and release peak force of facet joint in extension by 97.09% and 95.42%, respectively. Both devices had no significant impact on adjacent levels. The maximum Von Mises stress in Coflex device was 637.56 Mpa in flexion, 528.86 Mpa in extension, while the maximum Von Mises stress in X-STOP device was 476.65 Mpa at extension position. The peak facet contact forces of Coflex and X-STOP devices appeared in extension and were 19.76 Mpa and 49.28 Mpa, respectively. Conclusions: Coflex and X-STOP devices can effectively decrease the ROM and intradiscal pressure in extension, without affecting the adjacent levels.

"Abstract
Introduction There has been a phenomenal
worldwide increase in the development and use
of mobile health applications (mHealth apps)
that monitor menstruation and fertility. Critics
argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and
lack evidence from either clinical trials or user
experience. The aim of this scoping review is to
provide an overview of the research literature
on mHealth apps that track menstruation and
fertility.
Methods This project followed the PRISMA
Extension for Scoping Reviews. The ACM,
CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus
databases were searched for material published
between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019.
Data summary and synthesis were used to chart
and analyse the data.
Results In total 654 records were reviewed.
Subsequently, 135 duplicate records and 501
records that did not meet the inclusion criteria
were removed. Eighteen records from 13
countries form the basis of this review. The
papers reviewed cover a variety of disciplinary
and methodological frameworks. Three main
themes were identified: fertility and reproductive
health tracking, pregnancy planning, and
pregnancy prevention.
Conclusions Motivations for fertility app use are
varied, overlap and change over time, although
women want apps that are accurate and
evidence-based regardless of whether they are
tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or
using the app as a form of contraception. There
is a lack of critical debate and engagement in the
development, evaluation, usage and regulation
of fertility and menstruation apps. The paucity of
evidence-based research and absence of fertility,
health professionals and users in studies is raised.",1
"Abstract: Objective: This study investigates the effects of the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (KOA) with
autologous platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection on pain, pain mediators and inflammatory factors. Methods:
A total of 86 patients with advanced KOA who received treatment in our hospital were divided into the observation
group and the control group based on their sequence of receiving treatment (n=43 in each). The patients in the
observation group were treated with autologous platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection, while the patients in
the control group were treated with the intra-articular injection of a mixture of lidocaine and compound betamethasone. The changes of VAS score, knee joint swelling score, knee joint function score and serum inflammatory factors
before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. Results: The observation group had an effective rate of 86.05% for pain relief of advanced KOA, which is significantly higher than 62.79% in the control group
(P<0.05). After treatment, the swollen knee joint scores of the two groups were significantly decreased, the knee
function score was significantly increased, and the change of the observation group was greater than that of the
control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the expression levels of pain mediators, leukotrienes and inflammatory factors in both groups decreased significantly, and the observation group decreased much more than the control group
(P>0.05). Conclusion: The treatment of advanced KOA with autologous platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection
has good effects on the improvement of pain symptoms. It can effectively improve the degree and function of the
swollen knee joint of patients and reduce the levels of pain mediators and inflammatory factors, so it is worthy of
clinical promotion.

Background
Heat stress (HS) poses significant threats to the sustainability of livestock production. Genetically improving heat tolerance could enhance animal welfare and minimize production losses during HS events. Measuring phenotypic indicators of HS response and understanding their genetic background are crucial steps to optimize breeding schemes for improved climatic resilience. The identification of genomic regions and candidate genes influencing the traits of interest, including variants with pleiotropic effects, enables the refinement of genotyping panels used to perform genomic prediction of breeding values and contributes to unraveling the biological mechanisms influencing heat stress response. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to identify genomic regions, candidate genes, and potential pleiotropic variants significantly associated with indicators of HS response in lactating sows using imputed whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. Phenotypic records for 18 traits and genomic information from 1,645 lactating sows were available for the study. The genotypes from the PorcineSNP50K panel containing 50,703 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were imputed to WGS and after quality control, 1,622 animals and 7,065,922 SNPs were included in the analyses.

Results
A total of 1,388 unique SNPs located on sixteen chromosomes were found to be associated with 11 traits. Twenty gene ontology terms and 11 biological pathways were shown to be associated with variability in ear skin temperature, shoulder skin temperature, rump skin temperature, tail skin temperature, respiration rate, panting score, vaginal temperature automatically measured every 10 min, vaginal temperature measured at 0800 h, hair density score, body condition score, and ear area. Seven, five, six, two, seven, 15, and 14 genes with potential pleiotropic effects were identified for indicators of skin temperature, vaginal temperature, animal temperature, respiration rate, thermoregulatory traits, anatomical traits, and all traits, respectively.

Conclusions
Physiological and anatomical indicators of HS response in lactating sows are heritable but highly polygenic. The candidate genes found are associated with important gene ontology terms and biological pathways related to heat shock protein activities, immune response, and cellular oxidative stress. Many of the candidate genes with pleiotropic effects are involved in catalytic activities to reduce cell damage from oxidative stress and cellular mechanisms related to immune response.

"Abstract
Exposure to media coverage of mass violence has been shown to predict poorer mental health symptomology. However, it is unknown whether such media coverage can have ubiquitous effects on average community members, extending to biological and perceptual processes that underlie everyday decision making and behavior. Here, we used a repeated-measures design over the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings to track participants’ self-reported distress, their eye blink startle reactivity while viewing images of the bombings, and their ability to perceptually distinguish armed from unarmed individuals in a behavioral shooting task. We leveraged a computational linguistics method in which we sampled news content from the sources our participants most commonly self-reported reading, and then quantified both the extent of news coverage about the marathon and the affective tone of that news coverage. Results revealed that participants experienced greater current distress, greater physiological reactivity to threats, and poorer perceptual sensitivity when recent news coverage of the marathon contained more affectively negative words. This is the first empirical work to examine relationships between the media’s affective tone in its coverage of mass violence and individuals’ threat perception and physiological threat reactivity.

"Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease with worldwide prevalence that is associated with a decrease in the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The aim of the present study was to explore the potential hub genes of EPCs in patients with type 2 DM. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from a public microarray dataset (accession no. GSE43950). Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized. The most significantly clustered modules and hub genes were identified using Cytoscape. Furthermore, hub genes were validated by quantitative PCR analysis of EPCs isolated from diabetic and normal subjects. Subsequently, weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify the modules incorporating the genes exhibiting the most significant variance. A total of 970 DEGs were obtained and they were mainly accumulated in inflammation‑associated pathways. A total of 9 hub genes were extracted from the PPI network and the highest differential expression was determined for the interleukin 8 (IL8) and CXC chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) genes. In the WGCNA performed to determine the modules associated with type 2 DM, one module incorporated IL8 and CXCL1. Finally, pathway enrichment of 10% genes in the pink module ordered by intramodular connectivity (IC) was associated with the IL17 and the chemokine signaling pathways. The present results revealed that the expression of IL8 and CXCL1 may serve important roles in the pathophysiology of EPCs during type 2 DM and inflammatory response may be critical for the reduced number and hypofunction of EPCs isolated from patients with diabetes.",1

Background
Early diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis is of great significance for regression. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. We did this study to explore the factors associated with the clinical diagnosis of neurosyphilis and assess their accuracy for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 100 cases of syphilis patients who underwent lumbar puncture at a major dermatology hospital in Guangzhou, China between April 2013 and November 2016. Fifty patients who were clinically diagnosed with neurosyphilis were selected as case group. Control group consisted of 50 general syphilis patients who were matched with age and gender. The records of patients were reviewed to collect data of socio-demographic information, clinical symptom, and laboratory indicators. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore diagnostic indictors, and ROC analysis was used to assess diagnostic accuracy.

Results
Neurological symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 59.281, 95% CI:5.215–662.910, P = 0.001), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) titer (OR = 1.004, 95% CI:1.002–1.006, P < 0.001), CSF protein (OR = 1.005, 95% CI:1.000–1.009, P = 0.041), and CSF white blood cell (WBC) (OR = 1.120, 95% CI:1.017–1.233, P = 0.021) were found to be statistically associated with neurosyphilis. In ROC analysis, CSF TPPA titer had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 84%, and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.941.

Conclusion
CSF TPPA can potentially be considered as an alternative test for diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Combining with neurological symptoms, CSF protein, CSF WBC, the diagnosis would have a higher sensitivity.",1
"Abstract:
We report a numerical study of a broadband metamaterial absorber in visible light region by utilizing a single layer of metal-dielectric-metal configuration. The absorption bandwidth and absorption performances are tailored by varying the resonator shapes and metal materials. The absorption bandwidth of the proposed metamaterial absorber (MA) structure is enhanced significantly with decreasing the order of rotational symmetry of the resonator shape. Using gold configuration, the twofold symmetry MA structure based on the double-sized axe shaped resonator exhibits the broadband absorption response over the entire visible light and apart of infrared spectrum range from 320 to 982 nm with absorptivity above 90% for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations. The physical mechanism of broadband absorption is explained by the current, electric, and magnetic distributions, significantly affected by the propagating surface and localized surface plasmon resonances. Furthermore, the high absorber performances of the twofold symmetry MA structure can be obtained over entire visible light region (400-700 nm) for both noble metal of gold and low-cost metal of nickel configurations, indicating the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for low-cost and large-scale fabricate device operated in visible light region.",1

Probiotic is little known for its benefits on upper gastrointestinal health. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the frequency and severity of symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the general adult population. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for prospective studies on GERD, heartburn, regurgitation, and dyspepsia, without any limitation on sample size. The Jadad scale was used to evaluate the quality of randomized controlled trials. In total, 13 prospective studies that were published in 12 articles were included in the analysis and scored per the Jadad scale as high- (five studies), medium- (two), and low- (six) quality. One article reported on two probiotic groups; thus, 14 comparisons were included in the selected studies, of which 11 (79%) reported positive benefits of probiotics on symptoms of GERD. Five out of 11 positive outcomes (45%) noted benefits on reflux symptoms: three noted reduced regurgitation; improvements in reflux or heartburn were seen in one study; five (45%) saw improvements in dyspepsia symptoms; and nine (81%) saw improvements in other upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea (three studies), abdominal pain (five), and gas-related symptoms (four), such as belching, gurgling, and burping. In conclusion, probiotic use can be beneficial for GERD symptoms, such as regurgitation and heartburn. However, proper placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blinded clinical trials with a sufficient number of participants are warranted to confirm its efficacy in alleviating these symptoms. Further, interventions with longer durations and an intermediate analysis of endpoints should be considered to determine the proper therapeutic window.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent disease and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Although many studies have partially revealed the occurrence and development process of MDD, the
pathogeny and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis
(WGCNA) was used to explore the co-expression modules and hub genes in MDD. A protein–protein interaction
(PPI) network of the most significant module and a TF-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network of MDD were constructed using bioinformatics analysis tools. A KEGG pathway and gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment
analysis of the genes in the significant module was performed using DAVID. Five hub genes in the PPI network
and 10 genes in the TF-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network with high degree values were identified, which may
provide new insights for the investigation of key pathways, diagnostic bio-markers, and therapeutic targets of

"The effect of sacubitril-valsartan in heart failure patients with mid-range (HFmEF) and preserved (HFpEF)
ejection fractions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical benefits of sacubitrilvalsartan in HFmEF and HFpEF patients.
Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched from
inception to 29 February 2020 to identify pertinent articles. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were
included and analysed.
Results Six (6) studies, with a total of 5,503 patients, were included. Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, sacubitril-valsartan significantly reduced the rate of HF hospitalisation (risk ratios, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.91; p,0.001) and improved the New York Heart Association class
(risk ratios, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10–1.43; p=0.001) in HFmEF and HFpEF patients. Both the cardiovascular mortality
and all-cause mortality were not significantly decreased by sacubitril-valsartan. In addition, there were no
significant between-group differences in the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and left ventricular
ejection fraction changes. Regarding safety, sacubitril-valsartan was likely to increase the risk of hypotension,
but the incidence of serum creatinine elevation was significantly lower in the sacubitril-valsartan group than in
the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers group.
Conclusions This meta-analysis suggests that sacubitril-valsartan may be an effective and safe strategy with which to
improve the clinical symptoms and reduce HF hospitalisation in HFmEF and HFpEF patients.

Background: Sepsis among newborns is common and a major cause of neonatal deaths
in developing countries. Annually, about 4 million neonatal deaths occur around the world.
Of these, more than 30% are caused by infections majority of which start as umbilical cord
infections. Topical umbilical cord care can reduce omphalitis (umbilical cord infection) and
neonatal mortality among newborns.
Objective: This study aimed to compare the incidence of omphalitis in diff erent cord care
interventions (Dry, Chlorhexidine, and Alcohol) in Nakuru County, Kenya.
Methodology: A randomized controlled trial was carried out between July 2018 and June
2019. A total of 540 newborns were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 cord care regimens;
twice cord cleansing with 4% chlorhexidine (Group 1), twice cord cleansing with 70% alcohol
(Group 2), and dry cord care (Group 3) as control.
Results: The risk of omphalitis was signifi cantly reduced in the chlorhexidine group than
in dry and alcohol cord care groups. The incidence of omphalitis was 1.95 times more likely to
occur among the dry cord care group [AOR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.13-3.38; p = 0.017] compared to
the chlorhexidine group. Similarly, babies in the alcohol group were nearly 2 times more likely
to develop omphalitis [AOR = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.15-33.40; p = 0.014] compared to those in the
chlorhexidine group.
Conclusion and recommendation: Chlorhexidine topical cord care signifi cantly reduces
the risk of umbilical infection in neonates when compared to both topical alcohol application and
dry cord care approach. It should be recommended to be used topically for the prevention of
omphalitis in our setup.",1

Objective To determine the effectiveness of physical activity interventions involving mobile applications (apps) or trackers with automated and continuous self-monitoring and feedback.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources PubMed and seven additional databases, from 2007 to 2020.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials in adults (18–65 years old) without chronic illness, testing a mobile app or an activity tracker, with any comparison, where the main outcome was a physical activity measure. Independent screening was conducted.

Data extraction and synthesis We conducted random effects meta-analysis and all effect sizes were transformed into standardised difference in means (SDM). We conducted exploratory metaregression with continuous and discrete moderators identified as statistically significant in subgroup analyses.

Main outcome measures Physical activity: daily step counts, min/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, weekly days exercised, min/week of total physical activity, metabolic equivalents.

Results Thirty-five studies met inclusion criteria and 28 were included in the meta-analysis (n=7454 participants, 28% women). The meta-analysis showed a small-to-moderate positive effect on physical activity measures (SDM 0.350, 95% CI 0.236 to 0.465, I2=69%, T 2=0.051) corresponding to 1850 steps per day (95% CI 1247 to 2457). Interventions including text-messaging and personalisation features were significantly more effective in subgroup analyses and metaregression.

Conclusion Interventions using apps or trackers seem to be effective in promoting physical activity. Longer studies are needed to assess the impact of different intervention components on long-term engagement and effectiveness.",1

Proximal femoral fractures are a serious complication, especially for elderly patients. Detailed epidemiological analyzes provide a valuable resource for stakeholders in the health care system in order to foresee future development possibly influenceable by adaption of therapeutic procedures and prevention strategies. This work aimed at answering the following research questions: (1) What are the incidence rates of proximal femoral fractures in the elderly U.S. population? (2) What is the preferred treatment procedure for these fractures? Proximal femoral fractures occurred between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 in patients ≥ 65 years were identified from the Medicare Physician Service Records Data Base. The 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, equivalent to the records from approximately 2.5 million enrollees formed the basis of this study. Fractures were grouped into head/neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures. The overall incidence rate, age and sex specific incidence rates as well as incidence rate ratios were calculated. Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were used to identify procedures and operations. In 2019, a total number of 7982 femoral head/neck fractures was recorded. In comparison to 9588 cases in 2009, the incidence substantially decreased by 26.6% from 666.7/100,000 inhabitants to 489.3/100,000 inhabitants (z =  − 5.197, p < 0.001). Also, in intertrochanteric fractures, a significant decline in the incidence by 17.3% was evident over the years from 367.7/100,000 inhabitants in 2009 to 304.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019 (z =  − 2.454, p = 0.014). A similar picture was observable for subtrochanteric fractures, which decreased by 29.6% (51.0 cases per 100,000 to 35.9 cases per 100,000) over the time period (z =  − 1.612, p = 0.107). Head/neck fractures were mainly treated with an arthroplasty (n = 36,301, 40.0%). The majority of intertrochanteric fractures and subtrochanteric fractures received treatment with an intramedullary device (n = 34,630, 65.5% and n = 5870, 77.1%, respectively). The analysis indicated that the incidence of all types of proximal femoral neck fractures decreased for the population of elderly patients in the U.S. within the last decade. Treatment of head and neck fractures was mainly conducted through arthroplasty, while intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures predominantly received an intramedullary nailing.

Background. In previous studies, electroacupuncture (EA) with 2/15 Hz has been shown to enhance the sedative effects in general anesthesia patients. Central lateral thalamic stimulation of 50 Hz showed an arousal effect in macaques. Therefore, it is worth studying the sedative effect of EA at peripheral acupoints with different frequencies, especially the frequency of around 50 Hz. Methods. Rats were anesthetized under the constant infusion of propofol and EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) locations. Electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate were continuously recorded before and after the intervention by EA in the C group (control), LEA group (low-frequency group, 2/15 Hz diffuse/dense wave EA stimulation), and HEA group (high-frequency group, 50 Hz stimulation). Results. In the LEA group, a significant increase in the power of the delta component with a decrease in the alpha component (p < 0.05) was observed after EA stimulation. In the HEA group, significant increases in the powers of alpha and beta components of EEG (p < 0.05) and a decrease in the delta component of EEG were observed (p < 0.05). The phenomenon is also shown in full-frequency waves. In addition, a significant decrease in the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio parameter was observed in the LEA group. Conclusions. EA at bilateral ST36 and PC6 can enhance the sedative effects of propofol anesthesia in low-frequency stimulation but lighten the sedative effects in high-frequency (50 Hz) stimulation. The sympathetic-vagal balance was affected due to low-frequency EA.",1

Artificial synapses are a key component of neuromorphic computing systems. To achieve high-performance neuromorphic computing ability, a huge number of artificial synapses should be integrated because the human brain has a huge number of synapses (≈1015). In this study, a coplanar synaptic, thin-film transistor (TFT) made of c-axis-aligned crystalline indium gallium tin oxide (CAAC–IGTO) is developed. The electrical characteristics of the biological synapses such as inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), paired-pulse depression (PPD), short-term plasticity (STP), and long-term plasticity at VDS = 0.1 V, are demonstrated. The measured synaptic behavior can be explained by the migration of positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo+/Vo++) in the CAAC–IGTO layer. The mechanism of implementing synaptic behavior is completely new, compared to previous reports using electrolytes or ferroelectric gate insulators. The advantage of this device is to use conventional gate insulators such as SiO2 for synaptic behavior. Previous studies use chitosan, Ta2O3, SiO2 nanoparticles , Gd2O3, and HfZrOx for gate insulators, which cannot be used for high integration of synaptic devices. The metal–oxide TFTs, widely used in the display industry, can be applied to the synaptic transistors. Therefore, CAAC–IGTO synaptic TFT can be a good candidate for application as an artificial synapse for highly integrated neuromorphic chips.",1
"Abstract
The “canonical” function of Pax7+ muscle stem cells (satellite cells) during hypertrophic growth of adult muscle fibers is myonuclear donation via fusion to support increased transcriptional output. In recent years, however, emerging evidence suggests that satellite cells play an important secretory role in promoting load-mediated growth. Utilizing genetically modified mouse models of delayed satellite cell fusion and in vivo extracellular vesicle (EV) tracking, we provide evidence for satellite cell communication to muscle fibers during hypertrophy. Myogenic progenitor cell-EV-mediated communication to myotubes in vitro influences extracellular matrix (ECM)-related gene expression, which is congruent with in vivo overload experiments involving satellite cell depletion, as well as in silico analyses. Satellite cell-derived EVs can transfer a Cre-induced, cytoplasmic-localized fluorescent reporter to muscle cells as well as microRNAs that regulate ECM genes such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9), which may facilitate growth. Delayed satellite cell fusion did not limit long-term load-induced muscle hypertrophy indicating that early fusion-independent communication from satellite cells to muscle fibers is an underappreciated aspect of satellite cell biology. We cannot exclude the possibility that satellite cell-mediated myonuclear accretion is necessary to maintain prolonged growth, specifically in the later phases of adaptation, but these data collectively highlight how EV delivery from satellite cells can directly contribute to mechanical load-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy, independent of cell fusion to the fiber.",1

Background
Ticagrelor may be a more effective antiplatelet therapy than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with acute cerebral ischemia.
Methods
We conducted an international double-blind, controlled trial in 674 centers in 33 countries, in which 13,199 patients with a nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack who had not received intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis and were not considered to have had a cardioembolic stroke were randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2 through 90) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90). The primary end point was the time to the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days.
Results
During the 90 days of treatment, a primary end-point event occurred in 442 of the 6589 patients (6.7%) treated with ticagrelor, versus 497 of the 6610 patients (7.5%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.01; P=0.07). Ischemic stroke occurred in 385 patients (5.8%) treated with ticagrelor and in 441 patients (6.7%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00). Major bleeding occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with ticagrelor and in 0.6% of patients treated with aspirin, intracranial hemorrhage in 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, and fatal bleeding in 0.1% and 0.1%.
Conclusions
In our trial involving patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, ticagrelor was not found to be superior to aspirin in reducing the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01994720.)

"The molecular mechanism underlying the protective role of propofol against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that ferroptosis is an imperative pathological process in myocardial I/R injury. We hypothesized that propofol prevents myocardial I/R injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via the AKT/p53 signaling pathway. The ferroptosis-inducing agent erastin (E) and AKT inhibitor MK2206 (MK) were used to investigate the role of propofol in myocardial I/R injury. H9C2 cells treated without any reagents, erastin for 24 h, propofol for 1 h before adding erastin were assigned as the control (C), E, and E + P group, respectively. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), cysteine/glutamate transporter (XCT), and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in H9C2 cells. Rat hearts from the I/R + P or I/R groups were treated with or without propofol for 20 min before stopping perfusion for 30 min and reperfusion for 60 min. Rat hearts from the I/R + P + MK or I/R + MK groups were treated with or without propofol for 20 min, with a 10-min treatment of MK2206 before stopping perfusion. Myocardial histopathology, mitochondrial structure, iron levels, and antioxidant enzymes expression were assessed. Our results demonstrated that erastin increased H9C2 cell mortality and reduced the expression of antioxidant enzymes. I/R, which reduced the expression of antioxidant enzymes and increased iron or p53 (p < 0.05), boosted myocardium pathological and mitochondrion damage. Propofol inhibited these changes; however, the effects of propofol on I/R injury were antagonized by MK (p < 0.05). In addition, AKT siRNA inhibited the propofol-induced expression of antioxidant enzymes (p < 0.05). Our findings confirm that propofol protects myocardium from I/R injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via the AKT/p53 signal pathway.",1
"Abstract
Guidelines concerning the potentially harmful effects of scientific studies have historically focused on ethical considerations for minimizing risk for participants. However, studies can also indirectly inflict harm on individuals and social groups through how they are designed, reported, and disseminated. As evidenced by recent criticisms and retractions of high-profile studies dealing with a wide variety of social issues, there is a scarcity of resources and guidance on how one can conduct research in a socially responsible manner. As such, even motivated researchers might publish work that has negative social impacts due to a lack of awareness. To address this, we propose 10 simple rules for researchers who wish to conduct socially responsible science. These rules, which cover major considerations throughout the life cycle of a study from inception to dissemination, are not aimed as a prescriptive list or a deterministic code of conduct. Rather, they are meant to help motivated scientists to reflect on their social responsibility as researchers and actively engage with the potential social impact of their research.",1
"Currently, there are very few well-established treatments to stimulate corneal endothelial cell regeneration in vivo as a cure for corneal endothelial dysfunctions. The most frequently performed intervention for a damaged or dysfunctional corneal endothelium nowadays is corneal endothelial keratoplasty, also known as lamellar corneal transplantation surgery. Newer medical therapies are emerging and are targeting the regeneration of the corneal endothelium, helping the patients regain their vision without the need for donor tissue. Alternatives to donor tissues are needed as the aging population requiring transplants, has further exacerbated the pressure on the corneal eye banking system. Significant ongoing research efforts in the field of corneal regenerative medicine have been made to elucidate the underlying pathways and effector proteins involved in corneal endothelial regeneration. However, the literature offers little guidance and selective attention to the question of how to fully exploit these pathways. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of wound healing characteristics from a biochemical level in the lab to the regenerative features seen in the clinic. Studying the pathways involved in corneal wound healing together with their key effector proteins, can help explain the effect on the proliferation and migration capacity of the corneal endothelial cells.",1

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: O6
-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation confers an improved
prognosis and treatment response in gliomas. We developed a deep learning network for determining MGMT promoter methylation status using T2 weighted Images (T2WI) only.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain MR imaging and corresponding genomic information were obtained for 247 subjects from The
Cancer Imaging Archive and The Cancer Genome Atlas. One hundred sixty-three subjects had a methylated MGMT promoter. A
T2WI-only network (MGMT-net) was developed to determine MGMT promoter methylation status and simultaneous single-label
tumor segmentation. The network was trained using 3D-dense-UNets. Three-fold cross-validation was performed to generalize the
performance of the networks. Dice scores were computed to determine tumor-segmentation accuracy.
RESULTS: The MGMT-net demonstrated a mean cross-validation accuracy of 94.73% across the 3 folds (95.12%, 93.98%, and 95.12%, [SD,
0.66%]) in predicting MGMT methylation status with a sensitivity and specificity of 96.31% [SD, 0.04%] and 91.66% [SD, 2.06%], respectively, and a mean area under the curve of 0.93 [SD, 0.01]. The whole tumor-segmentation mean Dice score was 0.82 [SD, 0.008].
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate high classification accuracy in predicting MGMT promoter methylation status using only T2WI.
Our network surpasses the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of histologic and molecular methods. This result represents an important milestone toward using MR imaging to predict prognosis and treatment response.",1
"Abstract
Developing a vaccine against Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, remains a public health priority. Syphilis vaccine design efforts have been complicated by lack of an in vitro T. pallidum culture system, prolific antigenic variation in outer membrane protein TprK, and lack of functional annotation for nearly half of the genes. Understanding the genetic basis of T. pallidum reinfection can provide insights into variation among strains that escape cross-protective immunity. Here, we present comparative genomic sequencing and deep, full-length tprK profiling of two T. pallidum isolates from blood from the same patient that were collected six years apart. Notably, this patient was diagnosed with syphilis four times, with two of these episodes meeting the definition of neurosyphilis, during this interval. Outside of the highly variable tprK gene, we identified 14 coding changes in 13 genes. Nine of these genes putatively localized to the periplasmic or outer membrane spaces, consistent with a potential role in serological immunoevasion. Using a newly developed full-length tprK deep sequencing protocol, we profiled the diversity of this gene that far outpaces the rest of the genome. Intriguingly, we found that the reinfecting isolate demonstrated less diversity across each tprK variable region compared to the isolate from the first infection. Notably, the two isolates did not share any full-length TprK sequences. Our results are consistent with an immunodominant-evasion model in which the diversity of TprK explains the ability of T. pallidum to successfully reinfect individuals, even when they have been infected with the organism multiple times.",1
"The most recent version of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) was published in 2021. A special, hybrid guidelines meeting was convened by ESMO and the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (KSMO) in collaboration with nine other Asian national oncology societies in May 2022 in order to adapt the ESMO 2021 guidelines to take into account the differences associated with the treatment of MBC in Asia. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by a panel of Asian experts in the treatment of patients with MBC representing the oncological societies of China (CSCO), India (ISMPO), Indonesia (ISHMO), Japan (JSMO), Korea (KSMO), Malaysia (MOS), the Philippines (PSMO), Singapore (SSO), Taiwan (TOS) and Thailand (TSCO). The voting was based on the best available scientific evidence and was independent of drug access or practice restrictions in the different Asian countries. The latter were discussed when appropriate. The aim of these guidelines is to provide guidance for the harmonisation of the management of patients with MBC across the different regions of Asia, drawing from data provided by global and Asian trials whilst at the same time integrating the differences in genetics, demographics and scientific evidence, together with restricted access to certain therapeutic strategies.",1
"Abstract
Stress during critical periods of neurodevelopment is associated with an increased risk of
developing stress-related psychiatric disorders which are more common in women than men.
Hippocampal neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons) is vulnerable to maternal separation
and inflammatory stressors, and emerging evidence suggests that hippocampal neurogenesis
is more sensitive to stress in the ventral hippocampus (vHi) than in the dorsal hippocampus
(dHi). Although research into the effects of maternal separation stress on hippocampal
neurogenesis is well documented in male rodents, the effect in females remains
underexplored. Similarly, reports on the impact of inflammatory stressors on hippocampal
neurogenesis in females are limited, especially when female bias the in prevalence of stressrelated psychiatric disorders begins to emerge. Thus, in this study we investigated the effects
of maternal separation (MS) followed by an inflammatory stressor (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)
in early adolescence on peripheral and hippocampal inflammatory responses and
hippocampal neurogenesis in juvenile female rats. We show that MS enhanced an LPSinduced increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 in the vHi but not in the dHi.
However, microglial activation was similar following LPS alone or MS alone in both
hippocampal regions, while MS prior to LPS reduced microglial activation in both dHi and vHi.
The production of new neurons was unaffected by MS and LPS. MS and LPS independently
reduced the dendritic complexity of new neurons, and MS exacerbated LPS-induced
reductions in complexity of distal dendrites of new neurons in the vHi but not dHi. These data
highlight that MS differentially primes the physiological response to LPS in the juvenile female
rat hippocampus. ",1

Background
Integrating multi-omics data is emerging as a critical approach in enhancing our understanding of complex diseases. Innovative computational methods capable of managing high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets are required to unlock the full potential of such rich and diverse data.

Methods
We propose a Multi-Omics integration framework with auxiliary Classifiers-enhanced AuToencoders (MOCAT) to utilize intra- and inter-omics information comprehensively. Additionally, attention mechanisms with confidence learning are incorporated for enhanced feature representation and trustworthy prediction.

Results
Extensive experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, including BRCA, ROSMAP, LGG, and KIPAN. Our model significantly improved most evaluation measurements and consistently surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies showed that the auxiliary classifiers significantly boosted classification accuracy in the ROSMAP and LGG datasets. Moreover, the attention mechanisms and confidence evaluation block contributed to improvements in the predictive accuracy and generalizability of our model.

Conclusions
The proposed framework exhibits superior performance in disease classification and biomarker discovery, establishing itself as a robust and versatile tool for analyzing multi-layer biological data. This study highlights the significance of elaborated designed deep learning methodologies in dissecting complex disease phenotypes and improving the accuracy of disease predictions.",1

Importance  Understanding the effect of antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) treatment on functional connectivity will help elucidate the mechanism by which it reduces the risk of cerebral palsy and death.

Objective  To determine whether MgSO4 administered to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks is associated with increased functional connectivity and measures of functional segregation and integration in infants at term-equivalent age, possibly reflecting a protective mechanism of MgSO4.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study was nested within a randomized placebo-controlled trial performed across 24 tertiary maternity hospitals. Participants included infants born to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks who participated in the MAGENTA (Magnesium Sulphate at 30 to 34 Weeks’ Gestational Age) trial and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. Ineligibility criteria included illness precluding MRI, congenital or genetic disorders likely to affect brain structure, and living more than 1 hour from the MRI center. One hundred and fourteen of 159 eligible infants were excluded due to incomplete or motion-corrupted MRI. Recruitment occurred between October 22, 2014, and October 25, 2017. Participants were followed up to 2 years of age. Analysis was performed from February 1, 2021, to February 27, 2024. Observers were blind to patient groupings during data collection and processing.

Exposures  Women received 4 g of MgSO4 or isotonic sodium chloride solution given intravenously over 30 minutes.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Prior to data collection, it was hypothesized that infants who were exposed to MgSO4 would show enhanced functional connectivity compared with infants who were not exposed.

Results  A total of 45 infants were included in the analysis: 24 receiving MgSO4 treatment and 21 receiving placebo; 23 (51.1%) were female and 22 (48.9%) were male; and the median gestational age at scan was 40.0 (IQR, 39.1-41.1) weeks. Treatment with MgSO4 was associated with greater voxelwise functional connectivity in the temporal and occipital lobes and deep gray matter structures and with significantly greater clustering coefficients (Hedge g, 0.47 [95% CI, −0.13 to 1.07]), transitivity (Hedge g, 0.51 [95% CI, −0.10 to 1.11]), local efficiency (Hedge g, 0.40 [95% CI, −0.20 to 0.99]), and global efficiency (Hedge g, 0.31 [95% CI, −0.29 to 0.90]), representing enhanced functional segregation and integration.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study, infants exposed to MgSO4 had greater voxelwise functional connectivity and functional segregation, consistent with increased brain maturation. Enhanced functional connectivity is a possible mechanism by which MgSO4 protects against cerebral palsy and death.",1
"Abstract
The incidence of preterm birth (PTB) is increasing annually worldwide, leading to various health problems or even fetal deaths. Our previous work demonstrated the activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C 3 (TRPC3) in mice with PTB, and its activation could promote inward flow of calcium ions and uterine smooth muscle (USM) contraction via regulation of Cav3.2, Cav3.1, and Cav1.2. However, the upstream regulators of TRPC3 and its mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, the binding of miR-26a-5p to the 3′ untranslated region of TRPC3 was predicted by bioinformatics databases (TargetScanHuman and starBase v3.0) and confirmed by a dual-luciferase assay. MiR-26a-5p was downregulated, while TRPC3 was upregulated in the USM tissues of patients with PTB compared to people without PTB. The results showed that miR-26a-5p mimic transfection markedly reduced TRPC3 expression in LPS-stimulated USM cells. Additionally, miR-26a-5p regulated intracellular Ca2+ levels in USM cells by targeting TRPC3. Furthermore, miR-26a-5p inhibited the CPI17/PKC/PLCγ signaling pathway and reduced the expression of Cav3.2, Cav3.1, and Cav1.2. In conclusion, miR-26a-5p regulated the initiation of PTB by targeting TRPC3 and regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels. This study provides a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PTB.",1
"Abstract
Citations remain a prime, yet controversial, measure of academic performance. Ideally, how often a paper is cited should solely depend on the quality of the science reported therein. However, non-scientific factors, including structural elements (e.g., length of abstract, number of references) or attributes of authors (e.g., prestige and gender), may all influence citation outcomes. Knowing the predicted effect of these features on citations might make it possible to ‘game the system’ of citation counts when writing a paper. We conducted a meta-analysis to build a quantitative understanding of the effect of similar non-scientific features on the impact of scientific articles in terms of citations. We showed that article length, number of authors, author experience and their collaboration network, Impact Factors, availability as open access, online sharing, different referencing practice, and number of figures all exerted a positive influence on citations. These patterns were consistent across most disciplines. We also documented temporal trends towards a recent increase in the effect of journal Impact Factor and number of authors on citations. We suggest that our approach can be used as a benchmark to monitor the influence of these effects over time, minimising the influence of non-scientific features as a means to game the system of citation counts, and thus enhancing their usefulness as a measure of scientific quality.",1

Aim
To evaluate the association between sleep duration and severe periodontitis in Japanese workers.

Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study included 1130 workers (mean age 43.0 years) who underwent full-mouth periodontal examinations and health check-ups and completed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions on sleep duration. Logistic regression and a restricted cubic spline model were used to analyse the data.

Results
Severe periodontitis was identified in 6.3% of the study population. Those with <5, 5–5.9, 6–6.9, 7–7.9, and ≥8 hr of sleep were 6.7%, 17.4%, 40.3%, 26.3%, and 8.9%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, study participants who slept <5 hr were more likely to have severe periodontitis (adjusted odds ratio = 2.64; 95% confidence interval = 1.06–6.60) than those who slept 7–7.9 hr. The spline model, with a reference value of 399 min (the median sleep duration), showed a non-linear association between sleep duration and severe periodontitis, where an increased prevalence of severe periodontitis was observed only among those with a shorter sleep duration. The prevalence of severe periodontitis did not increase with longer sleep duration.

Conclusions
Short sleep duration was associated with severe periodontitis in this cohort of Japanese adults.

diagnose with a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) influence their Health – Related
Quality of Life score (HRQOL). Discharge recommendations are instructions provided
by healthcare professionals that assist individuals with the process of transitioning to
various levels of care. Current research indicates that those who have experienced a CVA
prefer to participate at light intensity level (1-2 days per week) whereas, healthcare
professionals recommend participating at a moderate to vigorous intensity level (3 – 5
days per week). Physical rehabilitation has been a common treatment for individuals who
have experienced a CVA focusing on impaired functioning. Eleven participants
completed the HRQOL self-reported assessment, and two participants reported
participating in discharge recommendations at a light intensity level, six participants
reported participating in discharge recommendations at a moderate intensity level days
per week) and three participants reported participating in discharge recommendations at a

Background
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of roxadustat versus epoetin alfa for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related anemia in patients new to dialysis.

Methods
HIMALAYAS was a Phase 3, open-label, epoetin alfa-controlled trial. Eligible adults were incident to hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis for 2 weeks to ≤4 months prior to randomization and had mean hemoglobin (Hb) ≤10.0 g/dL. Primary endpoints were mean Hb (g/dL) change from baseline averaged over Weeks 28–52 regardless of rescue therapy [non-inferiority criterion: lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) for treatment difference >−0.75] and percentage of patients achieving an Hb response between Weeks 1 and 24 censored for rescue therapy (non-inferiority margin for between-group difference −15%). Adverse events were monitored.

Results
The intent-to-treat population included patients randomized to roxadustat (n = 522) or epoetin alfa (n = 521). Mean (standard deviation) Hb changes from baseline averaged over Weeks 28–52 were 2.57 (1.27) and 2.36 (1.21) in the roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups. Roxadustat was non-inferior [least squares mean difference: 0.18 (95% CI 0.08, 0.29)] to epoetin alfa. Percentages of patients with an Hb response were 88.2% and 84.4% in the roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups, respectively. Roxadustat was non-inferior to epoetin alfa [treatment-group difference 3.5% (95% CI −0.7%, 7.7%)]. Adverse event rates were comparable between treatment groups.

Conclusions
Roxadustat was efficacious for correcting and maintaining Hb levels compared with epoetin alfa. Roxadustat had an acceptable safety profile.",1
"Background
Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.
Findings
We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 0·9 [95% uncertainty interval 0·1 to 1·8; p=0·029] for human mobility, 18·1 [7·9 to 28·3; p=0·0005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0·9 [0·1 to 1·7; p=0·022] and 13·8 [10·7 to 17·0; p<0·0001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (−0·007 [–0·009 to −0·006; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, −0·003 [–0·005 to −0·002; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53·2 million (44·8 to 62·9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27·6% [25·1 to 30·3]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152·9 cases (2722·5 to 3654·5) per 100 000 population. We also estimated an additional 76·2 million (64·3 to 90·6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25·6% [23·2 to 28·0]), such that the total prevalence was 4802·4 cases (4108·2 to 5588·6) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49·4 million (33·6 to 68·7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44·5 million (30·2 to 62·5) DALYs globally in 2020.
Interpretation
This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.

"Abstract
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in livestock fecundity, and many lncRNAs that affect follicular development and reproductive diseases have been identified in the ovary. However, only a few of them have been functionally annotated and mechanistically validated. In this study, we identified a new lncRNA (lncGSAR) and investigated its effects on the proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovine granulosa cells (GCs). High concentrations of glucose (add 33.6 mM glucose) caused high expression of lncGSAR in GCs by regulating its stability, and lncGSAR overexpression promoted GCs proliferation, estrogen secretion, and inhibited progesterone secretion, whereas interference with lncGASR had the opposite effect. Next, we found that the RNA molecules of lncGSAR act on MiR-125b as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), and SREBP-cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) was verified as a target of MiR-125b. LncGASR overexpression increased the expression of SCAP, SREBP, and steroid hormone-related proteins, which can be attenuated by MiR-125b. Our results demonstrated that lncGSAR can act as a ceRNA to activate SCAP/SREBP signaling by sponging MiR-125b to regulate steroid hormone secretion in GCs. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of nutrient-regulated follicle development in ewes.",1

Background
The role of androgens on COVID-19 is well established. Proxalutamide is a second-generation, nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) with the highest antiandrogen potency among NSAAs and concurrent
regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and inflammatory response.
Proxalutamide has been demonstrated to be effective to prevent hospitalizations in early COVID-19 in
randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Conversely, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, preliminary results from
two different arms of an RCT (The Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV Trial) also demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality. This study aims to report the final, joint results of the two arms (North arm and South arm) of the
Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV trial of the two arms (North and South arms) combined, and to evaluate whether
COVID-19 response to proxalutamide was consistent across different regions (Northern Brazil and Southern
Brazil).

Upon randomization, hospitalized COVID-19 patients received either proxalutamide 300mg/day or placebo
for 14 days, in addition to usual care, in a proxalutamide:placebo ratio of 1:1 in the North arm and 4:1 in the
South arm (ratio was modified due to preliminary report of high drug efficacy). Datasets of the South and North arms were combined, and statistical analysis was performed for the overall study population.
Proxalutamide was compared to placebo group for 14-day and 28-day recovery (discharge alive from the
hospital) and mortality rates, and overall and post-randomization hospitalization stay. Results of
proxalutamide and placebo groups were also compared between the North and South arms. Analysis was also
performed stratified by sex and baseline WHO COVID Ordinary Score.
Results
A total of 778 subjects were included (645 from the North, 317 from the proxalutamide group and 328 from
the placebo group; 133 from the South arm, 106 from the proxalutamide group and 27 from the placebo
group). Recovery rate was 121% higher in proxalutamide than placebo group at day 14 [81.1% vs 36.6%;
Recovery ratio (RecR) 2.21; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.92-2.56; p<0.0001], and 81% higher at day 28
(98.1% vs 47.6%; RecR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.61-2.03; p<0.0001). All-cause mortality rate was 80% lower in
proxalutamide than placebo group at Day 14 [8.0% vs 39.2%; Risk ratio (RR), 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29;
p<0.0001], and 78% lower at Day 28 (10.6% vs 48.2%; RR, 0.22; 95% CI 0.16-0.30). Post-randomization timeto-discharge was shorter in proxalutamide [median, 5 days; interquartile range (IQR), 3-8] than placebo
group (median, 9 days; IQR, 6-14) (p<0.0001). Results were statistically similar between North and South
arms for all measured outcomes. Males and females presented similar results in all outcomes. Patients that
did not require oxygen use (scores 3 and 4) did not present statistically significant improvement in recovery
and mortality rates, whereas scores 5 and 6 presented significant improvements in all outcomes (p<0.0001
for all).
Conclusion
Proxalutamide increased recovery rate, reduced mortality rate and shortened hospital stay in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. Results were similar between the two different arms, providing further consistency for
the efficacy of proxalutamide when used in late-stage COVID-19.",1

Abstract
Background and Objectives: Post-infarct ventricular septal rupture (PIVSR) continues to have significant morbidity and mortality, despite decreased prevalence. Impella and venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA-ECMO) have been proposed as strategies to correct hemodynamic derangements and bridge patients to delayed operative repair when success rates are higher. This review places VA-ECMO and Impella support strategies in the context of bridging patients to successful PIVSR repair, with an additional case report of successful bridging with the Impella device. Materials and Methods: We report a case of PIVSR repair utilizing 14 days of Impella support. We additionally conducted a systematic review of contemporary literature to describe the application of VA-ECMO and Impella devices in the pre-operative period prior to surgical PIVSR correction. Expert commentary on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques is provided. Results: We identified 19 studies with 72 patients undergoing VA-ECMO as a bridge to PIVSR repair and 6 studies with 11 patients utilizing an Impella device as a bridge to PIVSR repair. Overall, outcomes in both groups were better than expected from patients who were historically managed with medicine and balloon pump therapy, however there was a significant heterogeneity between studies. Impella provided for excellent left ventricular unloading, but did result in some concerns for reversal of shunting. VA-ECMO resulted in improved end-organ perfusion, but carried increased risks of device-related complications and requirement for additional ventricular unloading. Conclusions: Patients presenting with PIVSR in cardiogenic shock requiring a MCS bridge to definitive surgical repair continue to pose a challenge to the multidisciplinary cardiovascular team as the diverse presentation and management issues require individualized care plans. Both VA-ECMO and the Impella family of devices play a role in the contemporary management of PIVSR and offer distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on the clinical scenario. The limited case numbers reported demonstrate feasibility, safety, and recommendations for optimal management.

"Abstract
In 2020 COVID-19 led to an unprecedented stream of papers being submitted to journals. Scientists and physicians all around the globe were in need for information about this new disease. In this climate, many articles were accepted after extremely fast peer-reviews to provide the scientific community with the latest discoveries and knowledge. Unfortunately, this also led to articles retraction due to authors’ misconduct or errors in methodology and/or conclusions. The aim of this study is to investigate the number and characteristics of retracted papers, and to explore the main causes that led to retraction. We conducted a systematic review on retracted articles, using PubMed as data source. Our inclusion criteria were the following: English-language retracted articles that reported original data, results, opinions or hypotheses on COVID-19 and Sars-CoV-2. Twenty-seven retracted articles were identified, mainly reporting observational studies and opinion pieces. Many articles published during the first year of the pandemic have been retracted, mainly due to the authors' scientific misconduct. Duplications, plagiarism, frauds and absence of consent, were the main reasons for retractions. In modern medicine, researchers are required to publish frequently, and, especially during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, when articles were rapidly published, gaps in peer-reviews system and in the path to scientific publication arose.",1
"Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates many biological functions involved in tumorigenesis and tumor development; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Sigma 1 receptor (Sig1R), a stress-activated chaperone, regulates the crosstalk between the ECM and tumor cells and is related to the malignant characteristics of several tumors. However, the link between Sig1R overexpression and ECM during malignancy has not been established in bladder cancer (BC).

Here, we analyzed the interaction of Sig1R and β-integrin in BC cells and its role in ECM-mediated cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We found that Sig1R forms a complex with β-integrin to promote ECM-mediated BC cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which enhances the aggressiveness of the tumor cells. This leads to poor survival. Our research revealed that Sig1R mediates the cross-talk between BC cells and their ECM microenvironment, thereby driving the progression of BC. Promisingly, targeting an ion channel function through Sig1R inhibition may serve as a potential approach for BC treatment.

Objective
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a metabolic syndrome in which steroidogenesis, folliculogenesis, and cellular adhesion play crucial roles in its prognosis. These pathways are controlled and regulated by some small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRs). Several miRs have differential expression in PCOS compared to healthy women, and their dysregulation suggests important roles of miRs in PCOS pathophysiology. However, the role of miRs is still unclear, especially in various phenotypes of PCOS.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of miR-212-3p, miR-490-5p, miR-647, and miR-4643 in different subtypes of PCOS. Accordingly, nineteen PCOS patients with different subtypes based on Rotterdam criteria (A: 8, B: not detected in this study, C: 5, and D: 6 patients) and six control age and BMI matched women under ICSI treatment were selected. The relative expression of miRs was then measured in blood serum before hormonal treatment (S1) and before ovum pickup (S2), follicular fluid (FF), and cumulus cells (CC) in all subjects. Also, the expression of miRs predicted target genes (AMH, AR, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, GDF9, and HSD17B12) were done in the CC of understudy groups.
Results
In general, the results indicated that PCOS significantly increased the expression of miR-212-3p, miR-490-5p, and miR-4643 in FF and CCs compared to control. Although these miRs tend to increase in serum 1 of the PCOS patients, the differences were insignificant. However, there was a significant reduction in the expression of miR-647 in FF and CCs between PCOS vs. control. In addition, the miRs had significantly different expressions in various phenotypes of PCOS. For example, high levels of miR-647 in S2 and low levels of miR-490 in FF and miR-212 in CC can differentiate phenotype A from the other. Also, upregulation of miR-212 in FF and miR-4643 in S1 and low levels of this miR in FF can specifically differentiate subtype A from D. On the other hand, high levels of miR-4643 in FF and miR-490 in CC and lower titter of miR-647 can distinguish subtype C from the other. On the other hand, high levels of AMH, AR, CYP11, CYP17, and HSD17 in the hyperandrogenic PCOS and upregulation of CYP19A1 in the hypoandrogenic group can validate the role of selected miRs in the prognosis of PCOS.
Conclusion
Characterization of altered microRNAs in serum, FF, and CCs and their targets in CC showed that the miRs might play critical roles in steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis. These miRs may be used for molecular classification of PCOS subtypes and as biomarkers for PCOS diagnosis.",1
"Abstract
Many Astragalus species exhibit seeds with physical dormancy (PY), but little is known about the ecological context of this dormancy. We focused on A. maritimus and A. verrucosus, two threatened Sardinian endemic species inside the subgenus Trimeniaeus Bunge. Fresh seeds collected from the only two respective known populations were used to investigate the effect of mechanical scarification, heat shock, and water imbibition processes on PY release and germination. PY can be overcome through mechanical scarification of the water-impermeable seed coats, while no dormancy break was detected, nor a subsequent increase in seed germination due to fire-induced heat. This suggests that fire does not trigger dormancy release and seed germination in these species. The seeds tolerate relatively high heat shock temperatures (up to 120 and 100 °C for A. verrucosus and A. maritimus, respectively), but after 120 °C for 10 min, the number of dead seeds increases in both species. These facts suggest the capacity to develop a soil seed bank that can persist after fires and delay germination until the occurrence of optimal conditions. As regards water imbibition, both Astragalus species did not show the typical triphasic pattern, as germination started without further water uptake. This study emphasizes the significance of understanding germination processes and dormancy in threatened species. In fire-prone ecosystems, PY dormancy plays a crucial role in soil seed bank persistence, and it may be selectively influenced by post-fire conditions. Understanding such adaptations provides useful insights into conservation strategies.

Purpose
This review aimed to investigate and describe the current research that has reported on family violence and food insecurity and to explore any links. Research is beginning to explore the relationship between food insecurity and family violence, as such, this is a good time to review the current body of literature to identify existing gaps.

Methods
This research employed a narrative systematic review allowing for a broad search while maintaining methodological rigour. Key word searches were performed in 6 electronic databases in January 2023. Two overarching concepts were used: “family violence” and “food security”. The findings were synthesised into a narrative review, reporting on specific population groups separately.

Results
The search generated 1724 articles, of which 868 were duplicates. The titles and abstracts of 856 articles were screened; 765 articles were excluded because they did not investigate the experience of food insecurity and family violence. The full text of 91 articles was reviewed, with 32 included in this review. Most were from the USA, and most employed qualitative or mixed methods. Studies explored food insecurity and family violence in women, men and women, children, people who are HIV positive, and the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and food insecurity.

Conclusions
Food insecurity and family violence are significant societal problems, with evidence that both have increased in prevalence and severity due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides initial evidence for a bi-directional relationship between food insecurity and family violence in high income countries.

"Abstract
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a well-known methyltransferase, mediates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and plays a crucial role in several kidney disease models. However, its role in renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury still remains unclear. In this study, we found that EZH2 was positively related to renal I/R injury and inhibition of EZH2 with DZNeP alleviated I/R injury and blocked the activation of oxidative stress and pyroptosis in vivo. Similarly, inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNeP or si-RNA also exerted an inhibitory effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced oxidative stress and pyroptosis in vitro. Moreover, further study revealed that ablation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) suppressed pyroptosis in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line cells exposed to H/R stimulation. Furthermore, Nox4, which was positively related to the generation of ROS, was upregulated during H/R process, while it could be reversed by EZH2 inhibition. Consistently, Nox4-mediated ROS generation was attenuated upon inhibition of EZH2 with DZNeP or si-RNA. Additionally, the transcriptional activity of Nox4 was enhanced by the activation of ALK5/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, which was abolished by ALK5 knockdown in vitro. Finally, EZH2 inhibition blocked H/R and I/R-activated ALK5/Smad2/3 pathway and also resulted in an obvious decrease in the transcriptional activity and protein expression levels of Nox4. In conclusion, our results proved that EZH2 inhibition alleviated renal pyroptosis by blocking Nox4-dependent ROS generation through ALK5/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, indicating that EZH2 could be a potential therapeutic target for renal I/R injury.",1
"Abstract
Aim
In Japan, unlike Western countries, tocolytic agents are administered in long-term protocols to treat threatened preterm labor. Evaluating the side effects of this practice is crucial. We examined whether ritodrine hydrochloride had been administered in cases of maternal death, aiming to investigate any relationship between ritodrine administration and maternal death.

Methods
This retrospective cohort study used reports of maternal deaths from multiple institutions in Japan between 2010 and 2020. Data on the reported cases were retrospectively analyzed, and data on the route of administration, administered dose, and clinical findings, including causes of maternal death, were extracted. The amount of tocolytic agents was compared between maternal deaths with ritodrine administration and those without.

Results
A total of 390 maternal deaths were reported to the Maternal Death Exploratory Committee in Japan during the study period. Ritodrine hydrochloride was administered in 32 of these cases. The frequencies (n) and median doses (range) of oral or intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride were 34.4% (11) and 945 (5–2100) mg and 84.4% (27) and 4032 (50–18 680) mg, respectively. Frequencies of perinatal cardiomyopathy, cerebral hemorrhage, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pulmonary edema as causes of maternal death were significantly higher with ritodrine administration than without it.

Conclusions
Our results suggest a relationship between long-term administration of ritodrine hydrochloride and an increased risk of maternal death due to perinatal cardiomyopathy, cerebral hemorrhage, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pulmonary edema. In cases where ritodrine should be administered to prevent preterm labor, careful management and monitoring of maternal symptoms are required.",1
"Introduction: Post-stroke depressive symptoms (PSDS) are common and relevant for patient outcome, but their complex pathophysiology is ill understood. It likely involves social, psychological and biological factors. Lesion location is a readily available information in stroke patients, but it is unclear if the neurobiological substrates of PSDS are spatially localized. Building on previous analyses, we sought to determine if PSDS are associated with specific lesion locations, structural disconnection and/or localized functional diaschisis.

Methods: In a prospective observational study, we examined 270 patients with first-ever stroke with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) around 6 months post-stroke. Based on individual lesion locations and the depression subscale of the HADS we performed support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping, structural-disconnection-symptom mapping and functional lesion network-symptom-mapping, in a reanalysis of this previously published cohort to infer structure–function relationships.

Results: We found that depressive symptoms were associated with (i) lesions in the right insula, right putamen, inferior frontal gyrus and right amygdala and (ii) structural disconnection in the right temporal lobe. In contrast, we found no association with localized functional diaschisis. In addition, we were unable to confirm a previously described association between depressive symptom load and a network damage score derived from functional disconnection maps.

Discussion: Based on our results, and other recent lesion studies, we see growing evidence for a prominent role of right frontostriatal brain circuits in PSDS.",1
"RNA silencing is a conserved eukaryotic gene expression regulatory mechanism mediated by small RNAs. In
Caenorhabditis elegans, the accumulation of a distinct class of siRNAs synthesized by an RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) requires the PIR-1 phosphatase. However, the function of PIR-1 in RNAi has remained unclear.
Since mammals lack an analogous siRNA biogenesis pathway, an RNA silencing role for the mammalian PIR-1
homolog (dual specificity phosphatase 11 [DUSP11]) was unexpected. Here, we show that the RNA triphosphatase
activity of DUSP11 promotes the RNA silencing activity of viral microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcribed precursors. Our results demonstrate that DUSP11 converts the 5′ triphosphate of
miRNA precursors to a 5′ monophosphate, promoting loading of derivative 5p miRNAs into Argonaute proteins via a
Dicer-coupled 5′ monophosphate-dependent strand selection mechanism. This mechanistic insight supports a
likely shared function for PIR-1 in C. elegans. Furthermore, we show that DUSP11 modulates the 5′ end phosphate
group and/or steady-state level of several host RNAP III transcripts, including vault RNAs and Alu transcripts. This
study shows that steady-state levels of select noncoding RNAs are regulated by DUSP11 and defines a previously
unknown portal for small RNA-mediated silencing in mammals, revealing that DUSP11-dependent RNA silencing
activities are shared among diverse metazoans.

"ABSTRACT
Objective: Addressing high-risk alcohol and cannabis use represent major challenges to
institutions of higher education. A range of evidence-based treatment approaches are available,
but little is known concerning students’ receptiveness to such approaches. Prior work identified
that students were most open to individual therapy and self-help options for reducing alcohol
use, but less open to medication. The current study examines student receptiveness to
intervention approaches across a wider range of intervention approaches (e.g., remote/telehealth),
and extends to evaluate cannabis intervention receptiveness.
Method: Undergraduate students reported on alcohol and cannabis use, motives for and reasons
against use, and openness to an array of interventions for reducing alcohol and cannabis use.
Results: Informal options (self-help, talking with family/friends), individual therapy, and
appointments with a primary care provider (PCP) were endorsed most frequently. Group therapy
and medication were less commonly endorsed, though medication was endorsed at a higher
prevalence than in prior studies. Women generally expressed higher receptiveness than men.
Lower alcohol consumption was associated with increased receptiveness to some approaches.
Students at high risk for alcohol and/or cannabis dependence were less receptive to many
treatment options.
Conclusions: College students were open to a wide variety of approaches for reducing their
alcohol and cannabis use. These results can inform selection, implementation, and availability of
campus-wide services, especially as low-cost technological-based approaches are expanding.
Further attention to existing services (e.g., PCP) for addressing alcohol and cannabis use may be
considered, given students’ receptiveness to such approaches.

preventing episodes of overt HE, as compared with placebo/no-treatment. On comparative
analysis, no superiority was identified between agents, except rifaximin over probiotics (very
low quality) for reversal of minimal HE. Conclusions: Rifaximin and lactulose were most
effective for reversal of minimal HE. L-Ornithine L-Aspartate and lactulose were most
effective in prevention of overt HE. Lactulose was the only agent effective in reversing
minimal HE, preventing overt HE, reducing ammonia and improving quality of life; but with

"Abstract
The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) regulates the metabolism of
homocysteine in the human body, and MTHFR C677T polymorphism is correlated with
male infertility among Asian populations. The relationship between paternal MTHFR
C677T polymorphism and clinical outcomes is unclear due to conflicting study findings.
In the current retrospective study, we enrolled 849 infertile couples from the First
Affiliated Hospital of USTC, categorizing them into three subgroups based on their
paternal MTHFR 677 genotype: CC, CT and TT. The clinical pregnancy (CC: 60.8%,
CT: 62.5%, TT: 63.7%; p = 0.83), implantation (CC: 36.6%, CT: 42.2%, TT: 40.5%; p
= 0.15), blastocyst formation (CC: 49%, CT: 48.4%, TT: 50.6%; p = 0.49), good-quality
embryo (CC: 48.3%, CT: 49.8%, TT: 51.3%; p = 0.19), and normal fertilization (embryo
development) (CC: 67.1%, CT: 66.2%, TT: 67.5%; p = 0.51) rates were comparable
among all groups. Similarly, the live birth (CC: 54.2%, CT: 53.2%, TT: 53.7%; p
= 0.97) and miscarriage (CC: 10.9%, CT: 14.9%, TT: 15.7%; p = 0.45) rates were
comparable among the three cohorts. Regarding neonatal outcomes, the Apgar score,
gestational age at delivery, neonatal sex, birth weight, birth height and preterm birth
rates were non-significant among all groups. Finally, the rates of birth defects were
also comparable among individuals of all groups (CC: 0%, CT: 0.3%, TT: 1.9%; p =
0.18). These findings suggest that paternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism does not exert
any discernible effect on embryo quality, neonatal outcomes or birth defects in vitro
fertilization (IVF) treatment. Therefore, in our population, paternal MTHFR C677T
polymorphism is not informative in explaining IVF failure. Further studies, however
examining the other enzymes in the folic acid pathway are warranted.

"ABSTRACT
Background/Objectives: A fatal diagnostic error of suicidal intention, i.e., an error implying death or serious injuries (i.e.,
incapacitating, chronic injury) to the patient, may have civil liability (punishable error) for the clinician. The Scale for Suicidal
Ideation (SSI) is the reference psychometric instrument used to measure suicidal intention. A meta-analytical review was
designed with the aim of estimating the true reliability of the SSI in general and in different settings (moderators) with the aim
of correcting unreliability raw scores. Method: A total of 90 primary studies reporting SSI’s reliability (internal consistency) was
found in the literature, yielding a total of 92 effect sizes. Bare-bones meta-analysis of correlation coefficients correcting effect by
sampling error were run. Results: The results showed an overall mean true internal consistency of .8904, 95% CI [.8878, .8930],
meaning that 42.6% of the population standard deviation is error and 18.11% of an individual’s measure is error. Additional
estimations (moderators) of SSI’s reliability for gender (men: .8873, women: .8808) adaptation version (English: .9212, Korean:
.9052, Chinese: .8402, Italian: .9163, Persian: .8612), and population (subclinical: .8769, general: .9230, mental illness: .9040)
were obtained. All mean true estimations were under the desirable standard for applied settings where critical decisions are
made, .95. Furthermore, for populations with risk of suicide, such as prison inmates and militaries, mean true reliability could
not be computed as k was insufficient. Conclusion: Implications of true reliabilities obtained for the estimation of individuals’
true scores and population standard deviations are discussed. Examples of computation of true scores to minimize fatal
diagnosis errors were performed for both known reliability and unknown reliability settings (e.g., risk populations).",1
"Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. (AOM) is a medicinal herb for improving cognitive functions in traditional Chinese medicine for poststroke treatment, but its efficacies and underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that AOM could induce adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improve poststroke cognitive impairment via inducing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway. In order to test the hypothesis, we performed both in vivo rat experiments using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and in vitro neural stem cell (NSC) experiments using oxygen–glucose deprivation plus reoxygenation. First, AOM treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of BDNF, tropomycin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in the hippocampus, enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and improved the spatial learning/memory and cognitive functions in the post-MCAO ischemic rats in vivo. Next, in vitro studies confirmed p-coumaric acid (P-CA) to be the most effective compound identified from AOM extract with the properties of activating BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling pathway and promoting NSC proliferation. Cotreatment of BDNF/TrkB-specific inhibitor ANA12 abolished the effects of P-CA on inducing BDNF/TrkB/AKT activation and the NSC proliferation. Finally, animal experiments showed that P-CA treatment enhanced the neuronal proliferation and differentiation in the hippocampus, improved spatial learning and memory functions, and reduced anxiety in the transient MCAO ischemic rats. In conclusion, P-CA is a representative compound from AOM for its bioactivities of activating BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling pathway, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis, improving cognitive functions, and reducing anxiety in post–ischemic stroke rats.",1

Background and objective
The anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin C (VC) and the promising results it has shown in the treatment
for common cold have prompted clinicians to use it as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. The
purpose of this study was to find out the role of VC as adjunctive therapy in coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19).
Methodology
This study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital in
Karachi. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), one group received the intervention [50 mg/kg/day
of intravenous (IV) VC] along with the standard therapy, and the other group received standard therapy
only. Data such as age, gender, vitals, and biochemical values as well as outcomes including the number of
days required for treatment, hospital stay, need for ventilation, and mortality were compared between the
two groups and recorded using a self-structured questionnaire.
Results
COVID-19 patients who received IV VC became symptom-free earlier (7.1 ± 1.8 vs. 9.6 ± 2.1 days, p-value:
<0.0001) and spent fewer days in the hospital (8.1 ± 1.8 vs. 10.7 ± 2.2 days, p-value: <0.0001) compared to
those who received standard therapy only. However, there was no significant difference in the need for
mechanical ventilation (p-value: 0.406) and mortality (p-value: 0.31) between the two groups.
Conclusion
VC can significantly improve clinical symptoms in patients affected with COVID-19; however, it had no
impact on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation. More large-scale studies are required to
further assess the role of VC in the treatment of COVID-19.",1

Gene and protein expressions in pancreatic cancer cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cycle were tested by flow cytometry. In addition, cell migration and invasion were tested by wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. The correlation between ABHD11-AS1, miR-1231 and cyclin E1 was confirmed by dual-luciferase report and RNA pull-down. Finally, xenograft mice model was established to investigate the role of ABDH-AS1 in pancreatic cancer in vivo.

Results
ABHD11-AS1 was found to be negatively correlated with the survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. ABHD11-AS1 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, knockdown of ABHD11-AS1 greatly inhibited the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Meanwhile, ABHD11-AS1 bound to miR-1231 and cyclin E1 was found to be the target of miR-1231. Moreover, ABHD11-AS1 knockdown-induced G1 arrest in pancreatic cancer cells was reversed by miR-1231 antagomir. Finally, knockdown of ABHD11-AS1 obviously inhibited the tumor growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo.

Conclusion
ABHD11-AS1 silencing significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo. Thus, ABHD11-AS1 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",1

Mycobacterium tuberculosis–specific (M. tuberculosis–specific) T cell responses associated with immune control during asymptomatic latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) remain poorly understood. Using a nonhuman primate aerosol model, we studied the kinetics, phenotypes, and functions of M. tuberculosis antigen-specific T cells in peripheral and lung compartments of M. tuberculosis–infected asymptomatic rhesus macaques by longitudinally sampling blood and bronchoalveolar lavage, for up to 24 weeks postinfection. We found substantially higher frequencies of M. tuberculosis–specific effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ in the airways compared with peripheral blood, and these frequencies were maintained throughout the study period. Moreover, M. tuberculosis–specific IL-17+ and IL-17+IFN-γ+ double-positive T cells were present in the airways but were largely absent in the periphery, suggesting that balanced mucosal Th1/Th17 responses are associated with LTBI. The majority of M. tuberculosis–specific CD4+ T cells that homed to the airways expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and coexpressed CCR6. Notably, CXCR3+CD4+ cells were found in granulomatous and nongranulomatous regions of the lung and inversely correlated with M. tuberculosis burden. Our findings provide insights into antigen-specific T cell responses associated with asymptomatic M. tuberculosis infection that are relevant for developing better strategies to control TB.

Chitosan (CS) rich in ∼ 7 wt% nitrogen is the renewable nontoxic biomass material derived from seafood waste. Chitosan is a suitable precursor to obtain N-doped materials due to the nitrogen in acetamide and amine of chitosan. In this work, the new type of N-doped MXene nanomaterials is prepared from non-toxic biological chitosan and MXene using a simple, environment-friendly method as a potential electrode for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of 1MXene-1N reaches up to 286.28 F/g (154.59 C/g). After 10,000 charge and discharge cycles, the efficiency is always above 98%. The N-doped MXene turned out to be high electrochemistry and excellent stability due to the lone pair of electrons of the N atom and increased interlayer distance.",1
"Abstract
The “canonical” function of Pax7+ muscle stem cells (satellite cells) during hypertrophic growth of adult muscle fibers is myonuclear donation via fusion to support increased transcriptional output. In recent years, however, emerging evidence suggests that satellite cells play an important secretory role in promoting load-mediated growth. Utilizing genetically modified mouse models of delayed satellite cell fusion and in vivo extracellular vesicle (EV) tracking, we provide evidence for satellite cell communication to muscle fibers during hypertrophy. Myogenic progenitor cell-EV-mediated communication to myotubes in vitro influences extracellular matrix (ECM)-related gene expression, which is congruent with in vivo overload experiments involving satellite cell depletion, as well as in silico analyses. Satellite cell-derived EVs can transfer a Cre-induced, cytoplasmic-localized fluorescent reporter to muscle cells as well as microRNAs that regulate ECM genes such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9), which may facilitate growth. Delayed satellite cell fusion did not limit long-term load-induced muscle hypertrophy indicating that early fusion-independent communication from satellite cells to muscle fibers is an underappreciated aspect of satellite cell biology. We cannot exclude the possibility that satellite cell-mediated myonuclear accretion is necessary to maintain prolonged growth, specifically in the later phases of adaptation, but these data collectively highlight how EV delivery from satellite cells can directly contribute to mechanical load-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy, independent of cell fusion to the fiber.",1

Background
Skin barrier dysfunction precedes eczema development. We tested whether daily use of emollient in the first year could prevent eczema in high-risk children.
Methods
We did a multicentre, pragmatic, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial in 12 hospitals and four primary care sites across the UK. Families were approached via antenatal or postnatal services for recruitment of term infants (at least 37 weeks' gestation) at high risk of developing eczema (ie, at least one first-degree relative with parent-reported eczema, allergic rhinitis, or asthma, diagnosed by a doctor). Term newborns with a family history of atopic disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to application of emollient daily (either Diprobase cream or DoubleBase gel) for the first year plus standard skin-care advice (emollient group) or standard skin-care advice only (control group). The randomisation schedule was created using computer-generated code (stratified by recruiting centre and number of first-degree relatives with atopic disease) and participants were assigned to groups using an internet-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was eczema at age 2 years (defined by UK working party criteria) with analysis as randomised regardless of adherence to allocation for participants with outcome data collected, and adjusting for stratification variables. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN21528841. Data collection for long-term follow-up is ongoing, but the trial is closed to recruitment.
Findings
1394 newborns were randomly assigned to study groups between Nov 19, 2014, and Nov 18, 2016; 693 were assigned to the emollient group and 701 to the control group. Adherence in the emollient group was 88% (466 of 532) at 3 months, 82% (427 of 519) at 6 months, and 74% (375 of 506) at 12 months in those with complete questionnaire data. At age 2 years, eczema was present in 139 (23%) of 598 infants with outcome data collected in the emollient group and 150 (25%) of 612 infants in the control group (adjusted relative risk 0·95 [95% CI 0·78 to 1·16], p=0·61; adjusted risk difference –1·2% [–5·9 to 3·6]). Other eczema definitions supported the results of the primary analysis. Mean number of skin infections per child in year 1 was 0·23 (SD 0·68) in the emollient group versus 0·15 (0·46) in the control group; adjusted incidence rate ratio 1·55 (95% CI 1·15 to 2·09).
Interpretation
We found no evidence that daily emollient during the first year of life prevents eczema in high-risk children and some evidence to suggest an increased risk of skin infections. Our study shows that families with eczema, asthma, or allergic rhinitis should not use daily emollients to try and prevent eczema in their newborn.

"Backgrounds: The value of circulating microRNA (miR)-155 for breast cancer (BC) diagnosis may differ in different studies. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the potential application of circulating miR-155 in the diagnosis of BC.

Methods: Articles published before December 2023 and in English were searched in these databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, EMBASE and Google Scholar. A summary of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios (PLR), negative likelihood ratios (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated from the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) of each study. Additionally, the summary receive-operating characteristics (SROC) curve was constructed to summarize the TP and FP rates.

Results: The pooled parameters calculated were as follows: sensitivity, 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83-0.97); specificity, 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74-0.92); PLR, 6.4 (95% CI: 3.4-11.9); NLR, 0.09 (95% CI: 0.04-0.20); and DOR, 74 (95% CI: 22-247). The analysis showed a significant heterogeneity (sensitivity, I2 = 95.19%, p < 0.001; specificity, I2 = 95.29%, p < 0.001; DOR, I2 = 92.9%, p < 0.001).

Background
Seed dormancy and germination are key components of plant regeneration strategies. Aconitum barbatum is a plant commonly found in northeast China. Although it has potential for use in gardening and landscaping, its seed dormancy and regeneration strategy, which adapt to its natural habitat, are not well understood. Our aim was to identify conditions for breaking A. barbatum seed dormancy and determine its dormancy type. Embryo growth and germination were determined by collecting seeds over time in the field. Laboratory experiments that control light, temperature, and stratification period were conducted to assess dormancy breaking and germination, and GA3 was used to identify dormancy type.

Results
Seeds of A. barbatum have undeveloped embryos with physiological dormancy at maturity in autumn. The embryo-to-seed length ratio increases from 0.33 to 0.78 before the emergence of the radical. Under natural environmental conditions, embryo development begins in early winter. Laboratory experiments have shown that long-term incubation under 4 °C (cold stratification) promotes embryo development and seed dormancy break. With an extension of cold stratification, an increase in germination percentages was observed when seeds were transferred from 4 °C to warmer temperatures. Seeds exposed to light during incubation show a higher germination percentage than those kept in the dark. Seed germination can also be enhanced by a 100 mg/L GA3 concentration.

Conclusions
Seeds of A. barbatum display intermediate complex morphophysiological dormancy at maturity. In addition to the underdeveloped embryo, there are also physiological barriers that prevent the embryo from germinating. Dormancy breaking of A. barbatum seeds can be achieved by natural winter cold stratification, allowing seeds to germinate and sprout seedlings at the beginning of the following growing season. Our findings provide valuable insights into the seed dormancy and regeneration strategy of A. barbatum, which could facilitate its effective utilization in gardening and landscaping.",1
"Describing the factors that shape collective behaviour is central to our understanding of animal societies. Countless studies have demonstrated an effect of
group size in the emergence of collective behaviours, but comparatively few
have accounted for the composition/diversity of behavioural phenotypes,
which is often conflated with group size. Here, we simultaneously examine
the effect of personality composition and group size on nest architecture and
collective foraging aggressiveness in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola.
We created colonies of two different sizes (10 or 30 individuals) and four
compositions of boldness (all bold, all shy, mixed bold and shy, or average
individuals) in the field and then measured their collective behaviour.
Larger colonies produced bigger capture webs, while colonies containing a
higher proportion of bold individuals responded to and attacked prey more
rapidly. The number of attackers during collective foraging was determined
jointly by composition and size, although composition had an effect size
more than twice that of colony size: our results suggest that colonies of just
10 bold spiders would attack prey with as many attackers as colonies of 110
‘average’ spiders. Thus, personality composition is a more potent (albeit
more cryptic) determinant of collective foraging in these societies.",1

Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Recent studies suggest that organic solvent exposure could be closely related to breast cancer, although the evidence remains controversial. Thus, we evaluated existing epidemiological evidence for the association between occupational solvent exposure and breast cancer. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify published case–control and cohort studies that addressed occupational exposure to organic solvents and breast cancer, up to April, 2021. Meta-analyses using random-effects models were conducted to obtain the pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on the incidence of breast cancer in relation to occupational exposure. The pooled OR of breast cancer among workers exposed to organic solvents overall was 1.18 (95%CI, 1.11 ~ 1.25; I2 = 76.3%; 24 studies), compared to those with no exposure. After stratification by menopause and study location, it was revealed that the association between occupational exposure to organic solvents and the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09 ~ 1.67; I2 = 73.4%; 7 studies) was significant, and there was also a clear association in workers in Europe (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12 ~ 1.32; I2 = 82.9%; 13 studies). We observed a significant association between occupational exposure to organic solvents and breast cancer in both cohort and case–control studies.

"Abstract
Inflammation is increased by infection with pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. High levels of inflammatory mediators and infiltration of macrophages into inflammatory lesions were reported in severe inflammatory diseases. Here, the aim of this study was to evaluate an anti-inflammatory activity of di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dp44mT (1–100 ng/mL) had no effect on viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dp44mT (100 ng/mL) significantly reduced LPS-induced release of nitric oxide and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. A significant upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 by LPS stimulation was downregulated by treatment with Dp44mT. Dp44mT blocked activation of nuclear factor-κB by the interruption of IκBα phosphorylation. Dp44mT suppressed the phagocytosis. Furthermore, administration of Dp44mT significantly reduced the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-treated mice without side effects. In conclusion, these results indicate that Dp44mT has an anti-inflammatory activity and may be of therapeutic significant for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.",1
"ABSTRACTBackground. The rapid increase in antibiotic resistance by various bacterial pathogensunderlies the significance of developing new therapies and exploring different drugtargets. A fraction of bacterial pathogens abbreviated as ESKAPE by the EuropeanCenter for Disease Prevention and Control have been considered a major threat dueto the rise in nosocomial infections. Here, we compared putative drug binding pocketsof twelve essential and mostly conserved metabolic enzymes in numerous bacterialpathogens including those of the ESKAPE group andMycobacterium tuberculosis. Thecomparative analysis will provide guidelines for the likelihood of transferability of theinhibitors from one species to another.Methods. Nine bacterial species including six ESKAPE pathogens,Mycobacterium tu-berculosisalong withMycobacterium smegmatisandEschershia coli, two non-pathogenicbacteria, have been selected for drug binding pocket analysis of twelve essential enzymes.The amino acid sequences were obtained from Uniprot, aligned using ICM v3.8-4a andmatched against the Pocketome encyclopedia. We used known co-crystal structuresof selected target enzyme orthologs to evaluate the location of their active sites andbinding pockets and to calculate a matrix of pairwise sequence identities across eachtarget enzyme across the different species. This was used to generate sequence maps.Results. High sequence identity of enzyme binding pockets, derived from experi-mentally determined co-crystallized structures, was observed among various species.Comparison at both full sequence level and for drug binding pockets of key metabolicenzymes showed that binding pockets are highly conserved (sequence similarity upto 100%) among various ESKAPE pathogens as well asMycobacterium tuberculosis.Enzymes orthologs having conserved binding sites may have potential to interactwith inhibitors in similar way and might be helpful for design of similar class ofinhibitors for a particular species. The derived pocket alignments and distance-basedmaps provide guidelines for drug discovery and repurposing. In addition they alsoprovide recommendations for the relevant model bacteria that may be used for initialdrug testing.Discussion. Comparing ligand binding sites through sequence identity calculationcould be an effective approach to identify conserved orthologs as drug binding pocketshave shown higher level of conservation among various species.

"Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of breast cells due to altered gene expression is a key feature of breast cancer. Alterations in the expression of ion channels lead to variations in cellular activities, thus contributing to attributes of cancer hallmarks. Changes in the expression levels of ion channels were observed as a consequence of EMT. Additionally, ion channels were reported in the activation of EMT and maintenance of a mesenchymal phenotype. Here, to identify altered ion channels in breast cancer patients, differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression network analyses were performed using transcriptomic data. Protein–protein interactions network analysis was carried out to determine the ion channels interacting with hub EMT-related genes in breast cancer. Thirty-two ion channels were found interacting with twenty-six hub EMT-related genes. The identified ion channels were further correlated with EMT scores, indicating mesenchymal phenotype. Further, the pathway map was generated to represent a snapshot of deregulated cellular processes by altered ion channels and EMT-related genes. Kaplan–Meier five-year survival analysis and Cox regressions indicated the expression of CACNA1B, ANO6, TRPV3, VDAC1 and VDAC2 to be potentially associated with poor survival. Deregulated ion channels correlate with EMT-related genes and have a crucial role in breast cancer-associated tumorigenesis. Most likely, they are potential candidates for the determination of prognosis in patients with breast cancer.

Background and aims
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and its incidence has increased during the past decade. While hepatitis B and C virus infections and alcohol were established risk factors, the impact of smoking on the incidence and mortality of HCC was needed to be confirmed.

Methods
We reviewed cohort and case–control studies evaluating the association between cigarette smoking and incidence and mortality of HCC from MEDLINE and Google Scholar. We also checked reference lists of original studies and review articles manually for cross-references up to February 2016. We extracted the relevant information on participant characteristics and study outcomes, as well as information on the methodology of the studies. We also assessed the quality of the included trials using critical appraisal skills program checklists. Meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.3 software.

Results
A total of 81 studies were included in the systematic review. Pooled OR for HCC development with current smokers was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.46 to 1.65; P < 0.00001). Pooled OR for HCC development with former smokers was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.26 to 1.52; P < 0.00001) and pooled OR for HCC development with heavy smokers was 1.90 (95% CI: 1.68 to 2.14; P < 0.00001). Pooled OR for the mortality of current smokers with HCC was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23 to 1.34; P < 0.00001); and for former smokers with HCC, it was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.42; P = 0.04).

Conclusions
Cigarette smoking increases the incidence and mortality of HCC. Further studies are needed to evaluate possible impact of quitting smoking on decreasing this risk.",1
"Abstract
No data support the suggestion that first-trimester dydrogesterone use increases the risk of fetal abnormalities; however, two low-quality retrospective studies (one retracted by the journal) have suggested such a link. A scoping review and meta-analysis were carried out to address this discrepancy. The literature was reviewed but it was not possible to identify any evidence of a plausible mechanism for potential causality between dydrogesterone and fetal abnormalities. To investigate whether any evidence existed, a preliminary meta-analysis was undertaken of clinical studies published since 2005 on first-trimester dydrogesterone use with assessment of fetal abnormalities. A fixed effects model was used to determine pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). From 83 articles identified, six randomized controlled trials were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for maternal dydrogesterone use and fetal abnormalities gave a RR approaching 1 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.57, 1.62), confirming previous conclusions of no causal association between fetal abnormalities and first-trimester dydrogesterone use. Physicians, scientists and journal reviewers should exercise due diligence to prevent promulgation of retracted data. We are confident in using dydrogesterone, if indicated, in the treatment of threatened or recurrent miscarriage, and believe that its favourable safety profile should extend to its appropriate use in assisted reproductive technologies.",1

Objective
We aimed to systematically identify the possible risk factors responsible for severe cases.

Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane Library for epidemiological studies of confirmed COVID-19, which include information about clinical characteristics and severity of patients’ disease. We analyzed the potential associations between clinical characteristics and severe cases.

Results
We identified a total of 41 eligible studies including 21060 patients with COVID-19. Severe cases were potentially associated with advanced age (Standard Mean Difference (SMD) = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.34–2.12), male gender (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI:1.33–1.71), obesity (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.44–2.46), history of smoking (OR = 1.40, 95% CI:1.06–1.85), hypertension (OR = 2.42, 95% CI: 2.03–2.88), diabetes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.98–2.91), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.87, 95% CI: 2.22–3.71), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.63–5.41), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.54–3.97), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.89–4.38), malignancy (OR = 2.60, 95% CI: 2.00–3.40), and chronic liver disease (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.06–2.17). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 39.59, 95% CI: 19.99–78.41), shock (OR = 21.50, 95% CI: 10.49–44.06) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 8.84, 95% CI: 4.34–18.00) were most likely to prevent recovery. In summary, patients with severe conditions had a higher rate of comorbidities and complications than patients with non-severe conditions.

Conclusion
Patients who were male, with advanced age, obesity, a history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, malignancy, coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic liver disease, COPD, or CKD are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms. ARDS, shock and AKI were thought to be the main hinderances to recovery.

Understanding the mechanisms in the generation of neural stem cells from pluripotent stem cells is a fundamental step towards successful management of neurodegenerative diseases in translational medicine. Albeit all-trans retinoic acid (RA) has been associated with axon outgrowth and nerve regeneration, the maintenance of differentiated neurons, the association with degenerative disease like Parkinson's disease, and its regulatory molecular mechanism from pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells remain fragmented. We have previously reported that RA is capable of differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells to dopamine (DA) committed progenitor cells. Intracranial implantation of such neural progenitor cells into the 6-OHDA-lesioned substantia nigra pars compacta successfully regenerates dopaminergic neurons and integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway, ameliorating the behavioral deficits in the Parkinson’s disease rat model. Here, we demonstrated a dynamic molecular network in systematic analysis by addressing spatiotemporal molecular expression, intracellular protein-protein interaction and inhibition, imaging study, and genetic expression to explore the regulatory mechanisms of RA induction in the differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells to DA committed progenitor cells. We focused on the tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk), G proteins, canonical Wnt2B/β-catenin, genomic and non-genomic RA signaling transductions with Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression as the differentiation endpoint. We found that at the early stage, integration of TrkA and G protein signalings aims for axonogenesis and morphogenesis, involving the novel RXRα/Gαq/11 and RARβ/Gβ signaling pathways. While at the later stage, five distinct signaling pathways together with epigenetic histone modifications emerged to regulate expression of TH, a precursor of dopamine. RA induction generated DA committed progenitor cells in one day. Our results provided substantial mechanistic evidence that human trophoblast stem cell-derived neural stem cells can potentially be used for neurobiological study, drug discovery, and as an alternative source of cell-based therapy in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease.",1

■ Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising
tool for neurocognitive enhancement. Several studies have
shown that just a single session of tDCS over the left dorsolateral
pFC (lDLPFC) can improve the core cognitive function of working
memory (WM) in healthy adults. Yet, recent studies combining
multiple sessions of anodal tDCS over lDLPFC with verbal WM
training did not observe additional benefits of tDCS in subsequent
stimulation sessions nor transfer of benefits to novel WM tasks
posttraining. Using an enhanced stimulation protocol as well as
a design that included a baseline measure each day, the current
study aimed to further investigate the effects of multiple sessions
of tDCS on WM. Specifically, we investigated the effects of three
subsequent days of stimulation with anodal (20 min, 1 mA) versus
sham tDCS (1 min, 1 mA) over lDLPFC (with a right supraorbital
reference) paired with a challenging verbal WM task. WM performance was measured with a verbal WM updating task (the letter
n-back) in the stimulation sessions and several WM transfer tasks
(different letter set n-back, spatial n-back, operation span) before
and 2 days after stimulation. Anodal tDCS over lDLPFC enhanced",1

We report a numerical study of a broadband metamaterial absorber in visible light region by utilizing a single layer of metal-dielectric-metal configuration. The absorption bandwidth and absorption performances are tailored by varying the resonator shapes and metal materials. The absorption bandwidth of the proposed metamaterial absorber (MA) structure is enhanced significantly with decreasing the order of rotational symmetry of the resonator shape. Using gold configuration, the twofold symmetry MA structure based on the double-sized axe shaped resonator exhibits the broadband absorption response over the entire visible light and apart of infrared spectrum range from 320 to 982 nm with absorptivity above 90% for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations. The physical mechanism of broadband absorption is explained by the current, electric, and magnetic distributions, significantly affected by the propagating surface and localized surface plasmon resonances. Furthermore, the high absorber performances of the twofold symmetry MA structure can be obtained over entire visible light region (400-700 nm) for both noble metal of gold and low-cost metal of nickel configurations, indicating the proposed absorber is a promising candidate for low-cost and large-scale fabricate device operated in visible light region.",1

This study aimed to compare the long-term weight loss results, remission of comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies of sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and One-Anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) on type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of all the morbidly obese and diabetic patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB as primary bariatric procedures between February 2010 and June 2015 was performed. Anthropometric parameters, remission of comorbidities, nutritional deficiencies and supplementation requirements at 1, 2 and 5 years’ follow-up were monitored. Patients lost to follow-up 5 years after surgery were excluded from the analysis. Results: 358 patients were included. The follow-up rate was 84.8%. Finally, 83 SG, 152 RYGB, and 123 OAGB patients were included in the analysis. OAGB obtained significantly greater weight loss and remission of dyslipidemia than the other techniques. There was a trend towards greater T2D and hypertension remission rate after OAGB, while fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower after OAGB. There were no significant differences in hemoglobin or protein levels between groups. SG obtained lower iron deficiencies than the other techniques, while there were no significant differences in other nutritional deficiencies between groups. Conclusion: OAGB obtained greater weight loss and remission of dyslipidemia than RYGB or SG. Excluding lower iron deficiency rates after SG, there were no significant differences in the development of nutritional deficiencies between groups.

"Abstract
Eyewitness identification experiments typically involve a single trial: A participant views an event and subsequently makes a lineup decision. As compared to this single-trial paradigm, multiple-trial designs are more efficient, but significantly reduce ecological validity and may affect the strategies that participants use to make lineup decisions. We examined the effects of a number of forensically relevant variables (i.e., memory strength, type of disguise, degree of disguise, and lineup type) on eyewitness accuracy, choosing, and confidence across 12 target-present and 12 target-absent lineup trials (N = 349; 8,376 lineup decisions). The rates of correct rejections and choosing (across both target-present and target-absent lineups) did not vary across the 24 trials, as reflected by main effects or interactions with trial number. Trial number had a significant but trivial quadratic effect on correct identifications (OR = 0.99) and interacted significantly, but again trivially, with disguise type (OR = 1.00). Trial number did not significantly influence participants’ confidence in correct identifications, confidence in correct rejections, or confidence in target-absent selections. Thus, multiple-trial designs appear to have minimal effects on eyewitness accuracy, choosing, and confidence. Researchers should thus consider using multiple-trial designs for conducting eyewitness identification experiments.

This study was designed to explore the effect of Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture on cognitive defect and NLRP1 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD mouse.

Methods
Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were used as a model of AD. Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture was performed in four acupoints: “Baihui acupoint” (GV20), “Shenshu acupoint” (BL23), “Xuehai acupoint” (SP10), and “Geshu acupoint” (BL17). Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the cognitive function of the mouse. The levels of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, IL-1β, and IL-18 were examined by ELISA assay. Neuronal apoptosis and damage in hippocampal tissues were measured using TUNEL and Nissl staining, respectively. The expression of NLRP1, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 was examined using Western blot.

Results
Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture improved the learning and memory deficits of AD mouse. Meanwhile, Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture decreased the production of Aβ in hippocampal tissues of SAMP8 mice and attenuated the neuronal apoptosis and damage. Furthermore, Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture inhibited NLRP1 inﬂammasome activation in SAMP8 mice.

Conclusion
Bushen Huoxue Acupuncture could notably attenuate the cognitive defect of mouse AD model and inhibit NLRP1 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis.",1
"ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNA) play a critical role in chemotherapy-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in glioma. However, the underlying mechanism of chemotherapy-triggered EMT has not been fully understood. In the current study, we determined the role of miR-26b in regulation of EMT in stable temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant (TR) glioma cells, which have displayed mesenchymal features. Our results illustrated that miR-26b was significantly downregulated in TR cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-26b by its mimics reversed the phenotype of EMT in TR cells. Furthermore, we found that miR-26b governed TR-mediate EMT partly due to governing its target Wee1. Notably, overexpression of miR-26b sensitized TR cells to TMZ. These findings suggest that upregulation of miR-26b or targeting Wee1 could serve as novel approaches to reverse chemotherapy resistance in glioma.",1
"Abstract
Humans imbue the objects of their perception with affective meaning, a phenomenon called affective realism. The affective realism hypothesis proposes that a brain continually predicts the meaning of sensations (e.g., identifying a sound as a siren, or a visual array as a face) in part by representing the current state of the body and the immediate physiological impact that similar sensory events have entailed in the past. However, the precise contribution of physiological activity to experiences of affective realism remains unknown. In the present study, participants’ peripheral physiological activity was recorded while they made social evaluative judgments of target faces displaying neutral expressions. Target faces were shown concurrent with affective images that were suppressed from reportable awareness using continuous flash suppression. Results revealed evidence of affective realism—participants judged target faces more positively when paired with suppressed positive stimuli than suppressed negative stimuli—but this effect was significantly less pronounced among individuals higher in cardiac interoceptive sensitivity. Moreover, while some modest differences in peripheral physiological activity were observed across suppressed affective stimulus conditions, physiological reactivity to affective stimuli did not directly predict social evaluative judgments. We explore the implications of these findings with respect to both theories of emotion and theories detailing a role for interoception in experiences of first-person subjectivity.

"Despite recent advancements, the 5 year survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) hovers at 60%. DCLK1 has been shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as well as serving as a cancer stem cell marker in colon, pancreatic and renal cancer. Although it was reported that DCLK1 is associated with poor prognosis in oropharyngeal cancers, very little is known about the molecular characterization of DCLK1 in HNSCC. In this study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome-based computational analysis on hundreds of HNSCC patients from TCGA and GEO databases, and found that DCLK1 expression positively correlates with NOTCH signaling pathway activation. Since NOTCH signaling has a recognized role in HNSCC tumorigenesis, we next performed a series of in vitro experiments in a collection of HNSCC cell lines to investigate the role of DCLK1 in NOTCH pathway regulation. Our analyses revealed that DCLK1 inhibition, using either a pharmacological inhibitor or siRNA, resulted in substantially decreased proliferation, invasion, migration, and colony formation. Furthermore, these effects paralleled downregulation of active NOTCH1, and its downstream effectors, HEY1, HES1 and HES5, whereas overexpression of DCLK1 in normal keratinocytes, lead to an upregulation of NOTCH signaling associated with increased proliferation. Analysis of 233 primary and 40 recurrent HNSCC cancer biopsies revealed that high DCLK1 expression was associated with poor prognosis and showed a trend towards higher active NOTCH1 expression in tumors with elevated DCLK1. Our results demonstrate the novel role of DCLK1 as a regulator of NOTCH signaling network and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in HNSCC.",1

Background and Aim:
Treatment of endometriosis involves pain relief which is achieved through the administration of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with or without the addition of hormone therapy. At present, studies investigating endometriosis pain management using experimental rat models and the use of medications are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically evaluate research trends and critical points in the field of endometriosis pain management using experimental models.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 30 publications related to this topic that were published from 2012 to 2022 were retrieved from various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL, using appropriate English keywords. The quality of the publications was evaluated using impact metrics, productivity, term density mapping, and author network.

Results:
The average publication rate was three articles per year, reaching its peak in 2021 at five articles per year. The United States and China were found to be the most productive countries, with 12 and 10 publications per year, respectively. The field of medicine (37.0%) was the most abundant, although the H-index was relatively low (13:13). Term density mapping involved the search of 542 keywords, of which 35 were selected, with only 8 exhibiting significant density.

Conclusion:
In the past decade, there has been a shortage of publications that have addressed pain in endometriosis in experimental models and, within this context the majority of the production and publication in this field has been performed by the United States and China. After performing this bibliometric review, it can be inferred that more research is required in this field, to develop new approaches and treatments for endometriotic pain.

"Abstract
Background
Integrating multi-omics data is emerging as a critical approach in enhancing our understanding of complex diseases. Innovative computational methods capable of managing high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets are required to unlock the full potential of such rich and diverse data.

Methods
We propose a Multi-Omics integration framework with auxiliary Classifiers-enhanced AuToencoders (MOCAT) to utilize intra- and inter-omics information comprehensively. Additionally, attention mechanisms with confidence learning are incorporated for enhanced feature representation and trustworthy prediction.

Results
Extensive experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, including BRCA, ROSMAP, LGG, and KIPAN. Our model significantly improved most evaluation measurements and consistently surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies showed that the auxiliary classifiers significantly boosted classification accuracy in the ROSMAP and LGG datasets. Moreover, the attention mechanisms and confidence evaluation block contributed to improvements in the predictive accuracy and generalizability of our model.

Conclusions
The proposed framework exhibits superior performance in disease classification and biomarker discovery, establishing itself as a robust and versatile tool for analyzing multi-layer biological data. This study highlights the significance of elaborated designed deep learning methodologies in dissecting complex disease phenotypes and improving the accuracy of disease predictions.

"Abstract
Citations remain a prime, yet controversial, measure of academic performance. Ideally, how often a paper is cited should solely depend on the quality of the science reported therein. However, non-scientific factors, including structural elements (e.g., length of abstract, number of references) or attributes of authors (e.g., prestige and gender), may all influence citation outcomes. Knowing the predicted effect of these features on citations might make it possible to ‘game the system’ of citation counts when writing a paper. We conducted a meta-analysis to build a quantitative understanding of the effect of similar non-scientific features on the impact of scientific articles in terms of citations. We showed that article length, number of authors, author experience and their collaboration network, Impact Factors, availability as open access, online sharing, different referencing practice, and number of figures all exerted a positive influence on citations. These patterns were consistent across most disciplines. We also documented temporal trends towards a recent increase in the effect of journal Impact Factor and number of authors on citations. We suggest that our approach can be used as a benchmark to monitor the influence of these effects over time, minimising the influence of non-scientific features as a means to game the system of citation counts, and thus enhancing their usefulness as a measure of scientific quality.",1
"Background: Ulinastatin has been prescribed to treat sepsis. However, there is doubt regarding the extent of any improvement in outcomes to guide future decision making.

Objectives: To evaluate the effects of ulinastatin on mortality and related outcomes in sepsis patients.

Methods: Thirteen randomized controlled trials and two prospective studies published before September 1, 2018, that included 1358 patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock were evaluated. The electronic databases searched in this study were PubMed, Medline, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for Chinese Technical Periodicals.

Results: Ulinastatin significantly decreased the all-cause mortality {odds ratio (OR) = 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.35, 0.66], p < 0.00001, I2 = 13%}, Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score {mean difference (MD) = -3.18, 95%CI [-4.01, -2.35], p < 0.00001, I2 = 33%, and reduced the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (OR = 0.3, 95% CI [0.18, 0.49], p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%). Ulinastatin also decreased the serum levels of IL-6 (MD = -53.00, 95% CI [-95.56, -10.05], p = 0.02), TNF-a MD = -53.05, 95%CI [-68.36, -37.73], p < 0.00001, and increased the serum levels of IL-10 (MD = 37.73, 95% CI [16.92, 58.54], p = 0.0004). Ulinastatin administration did not lead to any difference in the occurrence of adverse events.

Conclusions: Ulinastatin improved all-cause mortality and other related outcomes in patients with sepsis or septic shock. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ulinastatin may be an effective treatment for sepsis and septic shock.

"Abstract
Wild ginseng has better pharmacological effects than cultivated ginseng. However, its industrialization is limited by the inability to grow wild ginseng on a large scale. Herein, we demonstrate how to optimize ginseng production through cultivation, and how to enhance the concentrations of specific ginsenosides through fermentation. In the study, we also evaluated the ability of fermented cultured wild ginseng root extract (HLJG0701-β) to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as its neuroprotective effects and antioxidant activity. In in vitro tests, HLJG0701-β inhibited AChE activity and exerted neuroprotective and antioxidant effects (showing increased catalyst activity but decreased reactive oxygen species concentration). In in vivo tests, after HLJG0701-β was orally administered at doses of 0, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg in an animal model of memory impairment, behavioral evaluation (Morris water maze test and Y-maze task test) was performed. The levels of AChE, acetylcholine (ACh), blood catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissues were measured. The results showed that HLJG0701-β produced the best results at a dose of 250 mg/kg or more. The neuroprotective mechanism of HLJG0701-β was determined to involve the inhibition of AChE activity and a decrease in oxidative stress. In summary, both in vitro and in vivo tests confirmed that HJG0701-β administration can lead to memory improvement.

Background
Ticagrelor may be a more effective antiplatelet therapy than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with acute cerebral ischemia.
Methods
We conducted an international double-blind, controlled trial in 674 centers in 33 countries, in which 13,199 patients with a nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack who had not received intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis and were not considered to have had a cardioembolic stroke were randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2 through 90) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90). The primary end point was the time to the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days.
Results
During the 90 days of treatment, a primary end-point event occurred in 442 of the 6589 patients (6.7%) treated with ticagrelor, versus 497 of the 6610 patients (7.5%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.01; P=0.07). Ischemic stroke occurred in 385 patients (5.8%) treated with ticagrelor and in 441 patients (6.7%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00). Major bleeding occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with ticagrelor and in 0.6% of patients treated with aspirin, intracranial hemorrhage in 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, and fatal bleeding in 0.1% and 0.1%.
Conclusions
In our trial involving patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, ticagrelor was not found to be superior to aspirin in reducing the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01994720.)

"Abstract
Background:
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can increase physical activity (PA); however, their long-term impact is not well understood.

Objective:
The primary aim of this study is to understand the immediate and long-term effects of mHealth interventions on PA. The secondary aim is to explore potential effect moderators.

Methods:
We performed this study according to the Cochrane and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO in July 2020. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of mHealth interventions targeting PA as a primary outcome in adults. Eligible outcome measures were walking, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total physical activity (TPA), and energy expenditure. Where reported, we extracted data for 3 time points (ie, end of intervention, follow-up ≤6 months, and follow-up >6 months). To explore effect moderators, we performed subgroup analyses by population, intervention design, and control group type. Results were summarized using random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.

Results:
Of the 2828 identified studies, 117 were included. These studies reported on 21,118 participants with a mean age of 52.03 (SD 14.14) years, of whom 58.99% (n=12,459) were female. mHealth interventions significantly increased PA across all the 4 outcome measures at the end of intervention (walking standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.55; P<.001; MVPA SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.21-0.35; P<.001; TPA SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.47; P<.001; energy expenditure SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.13-0.75; P=.01). Only 33 studies reported short-term follow-up measurements, and 8 studies reported long-term follow-up measurements in addition to end-of-intervention results. In the short term, effects were sustained for walking (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.42; P=.002), MVPA (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.35; P=.008), and TPA (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.13-0.93; P=.009). In the long term, effects were also sustained for walking (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.39; P=.001) and MVPA (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.27; P<.001). We found the study population to be an effect moderator, with higher effect scores in sick and at-risk populations. PA was increased both in scalable and nonscalable mHealth intervention designs and regardless of the control group type. The risk of bias was rated high in 80.3% (94/117) of the studies. Heterogeneity was significant, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence.

Conclusions:
mHealth interventions can foster small to moderate increases in PA. The effects are maintained long term; however, the effect size decreases over time. The results encourage using mHealth interventions in at-risk and sick populations and support the use of scalable mHealth intervention designs to affordably reach large populations. However, given the low evidence quality, further methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects.",1
"Abstract
The fact that many patients all over the world use homeopathic ultra high diluted succussed medicinal products, makes very interesting an explanation about the structure of them since until now only unconfirmed hypotheses are made. The present study focuses on the still unanswered questions about what happens with the chemical composition and the physicochemical properties of these products using Hypericum Perforatum L as a representative paradigm. All samples were prepared according to manufacturing procedures described mainly in S. Hahnemann's “Organon” and were examined by SEM, XRD, FTIR, DLS micro Mastersizer, DLS nano Zetasizer, UV-Vis and TEM. Measurements of electrical conductivity and pH were effectuated by the appropriate devices. During trituration of source material in alpha-lactose monohydrate some functional chemical groups present in source material disappeared and some others new ones came in view at the end of the process. A differentiation upon physicochemical properties between the source material and final triturating product was viewed, as well as micro-nanoparticles in colloidal form in all potencies derived trituration or extraction origin were present. The findings showed that the whole preparation process leads to the creation of micro nanoparticles something that for solid origin these products are created by trituration and for extract origin products these nanoparticles exist from the beginning.",1
"Abstract
Texture and flavour development in plant-based cheese generally relies on the use of texturizing and flavouring agents. However, fermentation can be a powerful tool to improve those sensorial attributes. Twenty-four different bacterial blends with four different starter cultures and six different adjunct combinations were designed to ferment a pea protein emulsion. Their acidification performance, contribution to gel hardness, and their ability to mask off-flavours and develop dairy-like flavours were evaluated through pH measurement, compression tests, and volatile compounds analysis, respectively. Blends including Vega™ Harmony and Vega™ Classic acidified significantly faster and were more efficient at removing the compounds identified as responsible for the green and/or beany off-flavours attributes in pea matrices. The presence of L. plantarum and L. casei in the blends reduced gel firmness. Dairy-like compounds were detected in all fermented samples and some were produced at different levels depending on the bacterial blend.",1

Background
Osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures often have postoperative complications despite a perfect reduction and an optimal fixation. We describe a simple technique using bone substitute augmentation and hypothesize that this method would prevent excessive sliding of the lag screw and potential subsequent complications.
Methods
Between January 2009 and July 2017, patients with osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures who were treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. DHS group patients received conventional DHS treatment and BSA-DHS group patients received bone-substitute augmented DHS treatment. Factors such as demographics, Parker and Palmer mobility scores, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores (short-form Health Survey-12 Physical Component Summary [SF-12-PCS], and SF-12 Mental Component Summary [SF-12-MCS]), morbidities, mortality, and radiographic outcomes were compared.
Results
We enrolled 85 patients: DHS group = 37 and BSA-DHS group = 48. There was significant lag-screw sliding (mean: 9 mm and 3 mm, p < 0.001), varus collapse (mean: 7° and 3°, p < 0.001), and femoral shortening (mean: 10 mm and 3 mm, p < 0.001) in the DHS group compared to the BSA-DHS group. The ability to get around the house was significantly different between the DHS and BSA-DHS groups (p = 0.031) at 3 months. Postoperative scores were not significantly different after 6, 9 or 12 months, however. Scores for the ability to get out of the house and to go shopping and the SF-12-PCS were significantly worse in the DHS group at 3 and 6 months. Malunion and lag-screw cutout were also significantly worse in the DHS group (p = 0.037 and p = 0.033, respectively).
Conclusions
Bone-substitute augmentation appears effective to prevent typical postoperative complications experienced by the DHS group patients, and to improve functional outcomes. Additional prospective randomized large-scale cohort studies are necessary to confirm this conclusion.",1

Background
There are few data on the long-term health outcomes of exposure to asbestos in childhood. This study investigated cancer and mortality of adults exposed to blue asbestos as children.

Methods
Data linkage to relevant health registries was used to identify cancers and mortality in a cohort of adults (n = 2,460) that had lived in an asbestos mining town during their childhood (<15 years).

Results
There were 217 (93 female) incident cancers and 218 (70 female) deaths among the cohort. Compared with the Western Australian population females had elevated mesothelioma, ovarian and brain cancers, and increased “all cause” and “all cancer” mortality. Males had elevated mesothelioma, leukemia, prostate, brain, and colorectal cancers, and excess mortality from “all causes,” “all cancers,” circulatory disease, diseases of the nervous system, and accidents.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer (BC). The purpose of the present study was to identify plasma miRNAs enabling early diagnosis of BC.

Materials and Methods
Expression levels of seven plasma miRNAs (miR-23a-3p, miR-29b-2-5p, miR-130a-5p, miR-144-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-152-3p, and miR-182-5p) in 106 patients with newly diagnosed BC and 96 healthy participants were analyzed by qRT-PCR. We also evaluated the relationship between the expression levels of these miRNAs and clinicopathological features of patients with BC.

Results
Compared with healthy controls, we found that miR-23a-3p (p = .025), miR-130a-5p (p = .006), miR-144-3p (p = .040), miR-148a-3p (p = .023), and miR-152-3p (p = .019) were downregulated in the plasma of patients with BC. MiR-130a-5p, miR-144-3p, and miR-152-3p were downexpressed in BC tissues as well as plasma. The expression of the miR-23a-3p, miR-144-3p, and miR-152-3p was related to ER positive and PR positive. Besides, miR-23a-3p, miR-144-3p, and miR-152-3p did show the significant difference in the staging compromised to the control, especially in stage I-II. Moreover, we also found that miR-144-3p and miR-148a-3p were associated with lymph node invasion.

Conclusions
The expression levels of the miR-23a-3p, miR-130a-5p, miR-144-3p, miR-148a-3p, and miR-152-3p were lower in patients with BC compared to healthy controls and were associated with ex hormone receptor, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis, indicating the diagnostic potential of these miRNAs in BC.

"Purpose
Patients with larger (T1b, >4 cm) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) not suitable for surgery have few treatment options because thermal ablation is less effective in this setting. We hypothesize that SABR represents an effective, safe, and nephron-sparing alternative for large RCC.
Methods and Materials
Individual patient data from 9 institutions in Germany, Australia, USA, Canada, and Japan were pooled. Patients with T1a tumors, M1 disease, and/or upper tract urothelial carcinoma were excluded. Demographics, treatment, oncologic, and renal function outcomes were assessed using descriptive statistics. Kaplan–Meier estimates and univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression were generated for oncologic outcomes.
Results
Ninety-five patients were included. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Median age was 76 years, median tumor diameter was 4.9 cm, and 81.1% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 (or Karnofsky performance status ≥70%). In patients for whom operability details were reported, 77.6% were defined as inoperable as determined by the referring urologist. Mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 57.2 mL/min (mild-to-moderate dysfunction), with 30% of the cohort having moderate-to-severe dysfunction (eGFR <45mL/min). After SABR, eGFR decreased by 7.9 mL/min. Three patients (3.2%) required dialysis. Thirty-eight patients (40%) had a grade 1 to 2 toxicity. No grade 3 to 5 toxicities were reported. Cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and progression-free survival were 96.1%, 83.7%, and 81.0% at 2 years and 91.4%, 69.2%, 64.9% at 4 years, respectively. Local, distant, and any failure at 4 years were 2.9%, 11.1%, and 12.1% (cumulative incidence function with death as competing event). On multivariable analysis, increasing tumor size was associated with inferior cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio per 1 cm increase: 1.30; P < .001).
Conclusions
SABR for larger RCC in this older, largely medically inoperable cohort, demonstrated efficacy and tolerability and had modest impact on renal function. SABR appears to be a viable treatment option in this patient population.",1
"Abstract
Oceanic calcifying plankton such as coccolithophores is expected to exhibit sensitivity to climate change stressors such as warming and acidification. Observational studies on coccolithophore communities along with carbonate chemistry provide important perceptions of possible adaptations of these organisms to ocean acidification. However, this phytoplankton group remains one of the least studied in the northern Indian Ocean. In 2017, the biogeochemistry group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-National Institute of Oceanography (CSIR-NIO) initiated a coccolithophore monitoring study in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS). Here, we document for the first time a detailed spatial and seasonal distribution of coccolithophores and their controlling factors from the EAS, which is a well-known source of CO2 to the atmosphere. To infer the seasonality, data collected at three transects (Goa, Mangalore, and Kochi) during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) of 2018 was compared with that of the late SWM of 2017. Apart from this, the abundance of coccolithophores was studied at the Candolim Time Series (CaTS) transect, off Goa during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM). The most abundant coccolithophore species found in the study region was Gephyrocapsa oceanica. A high abundance of G. oceanica (1800 × 103cells L−1) was observed at the Mangalore transect during the late SWM despite experiencing low pH and can be linked to nitrogen availability. The high abundance of G. oceanica at Mangalore was associated with high dimethylsulphide (DMS). Particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and scattering coefficient retrieved from satellites also indicated a high abundance of coccolithophores off Mangalore during the late SWM of 2017. Interestingly, G. oceanica showed malformation during the late SWM in low pH waters. Malformation in coccolithophores could have a far-reaching impact on the settling fluxes of organic matter and also on the emissions of climatically important gases such as DMS and CO2, thus influencing atmospheric chemistry. The satellite data for PIC in the EAS indicates a high abundance of coccolithophore in recent years, especially during the warm El Nino years (2015 and 2018). This warrants the need for a better assessment of the fate of coccolithophores in high-CO2 and warmer oceans.

"ABSTRACT
Amino acid permease-like (AAP-like) gene plays a critical role in absorbing amino acids
through roots in plants. A number of studies have been done on amino acids uptake in
plants but till date there is no report about the expression of AAP gene in Phaseolus
under field allied condition. The aim of this study is to measure the expression of AAPlike gene on alanine, glycine and proline amino acid uptake capacity in Phaseolus
vulgaris at field relevant concentrations. Amongst three amino acids, a drastic
significant increase of 63.15 fold in expression of AAP-like gene is observed in 50 µM
alanine at 2 hr. At 50 µM of proline and 25 µM of alanine, AAP-like gene expression also
shows high expression of 43.71 fold at 2 hr and 42.50 fold at 1 hr respectively. This
study elucidated the dose dependent relationship of glycine, alanine and proline with
the expression of AAP-like gene in amino acid transport in natural conditions in roots of
P. vulgaris. Additionally, this research is also useful in identification of plants needing
less surplus nitrogen additions and helpful in optimizing fertilizers by tailoring AAP
gene expression to match plant uptake capacities in agriculture.",1
"Context.—
An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed.

Objective.—
To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.

Data Sources.—
A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed, including 54 peer-reviewed papers and 18 non–peer-reviewed preprints.

Conclusions.—
Although the markers are considered nonspecific, acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin, were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated white blood cell count; marked lymphopenia; decreased CD3, CD4, or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts; high neutrophil count; thrombocytopenia; and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization, including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements, were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated interleukin 6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, or COVID-19 Severity Score, may be used to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality. Interpretation of the data reported in the studies reviewed here is limited because of the study design (mostly retrospective), limited sample size, and a lack of defined clinical criteria.",1
"Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of native antigen ELISAs and ADAMU-AE/CE commercial ICT test kits in subjects either exposed to Echinococcus infection or with clinically diagnosed alveolar (AE) or cystic (CE) echinococcosis. Methods: A total of 370 subjects with a previous clinical confirmation of CE or AE from northwestern China were recruited. Serum samples were also obtained from 3923 children/teenagers during a community survey. All sera were tested using native antigen ELISAs. The ADAMU-AE/CE test kits were subsequently used for the serology of the 370 clinically confirmed individuals and of 251 children/teenagers that were ELISA antibody-positive for both Echinococcus species but ultrasound-negative during baseline survey. An analysis of the association between the serological tests and ultrasound classification was carried out amongst 89 AE and 164 CE cases. A Kappa consistency analysis was undertaken to compare the diagnostic performance of the native antigen ELISAs and the ADAMU kits and the ultrasound imaging results. The χ² test was also used for a comparison of the different seropositivity rates between the groups. Findings: There was poor consistency (Kappa = 0.26 and 0.28 for AE and CE respectively) between the native antigen ELISAs and the ADAMU kits for the diagnosis of AE and CE among the cases and the surveyed children/teenagers, but a relatively good consistency (Kappa = 0.63) between the ADAMU-AE kit and ultrasound observations for the AE cases. Additionally, of the 251 teenagers co-positive for both AE and CE antibodies by the native antigen ELISAs, only one was found positive by the ADAMU-AE kit, verified as a new AE case on subsequent ultrasound follow-up. The remainder (N = 250) were negative by serology using the ADAMU-AE/CE kits and by ultrasound examination. The two native antigen ELISAs did not discriminate well between cases of clinically diagnosed AE and CE. In contrast, ADAMU-AE and ADAMU-CE commercial ICT test kits readily differentiated cases of AE from CE with specificities of 99% for AE and 100% for CE. Conclusions: The ADAMU-AE/CE kits proved reliable, accurate, and amenable diagnostic tools in the clinical setting for confirmation of suspected AE/CE cases. The native antigen ELISAs tests can provide useful information on the level of human exposure to Echinococcus infection.

Background:
As we are witnessing the evolution of social media (SM) use worldwide among the general population, the popularity of SM has also been embraced by health care professionals (HCPs). In the context of SM evolution and exponential growth of users, this scoping review summarizes recent findings of the e-professionalism of HCPs.

Objective:
The purpose of this scoping review is to characterize the recent original peer-reviewed research studies published between November 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, on e-professionalism of HCPs; to assess the quality of the methodologies and approaches used; to explore the impact of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs; to recognize the benefits and dangers of SM; and to provide insights to guide future research in this area.

Methods:
A search of the literature published from November 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, was performed in January 2021 using 3 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus). The searches were conducted using the following defined search terms: “professionalism” AND “social media” OR “social networks” OR “Internet” OR “Facebook” OR “Twitter” OR “Instagram” OR “TikTok.” The search strategy was limited to studies published in English. This scoping review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.

Results:
Of the 1632 retrieved papers, a total of 88 studies were finally included in this review. Overall, the quality of the studies was satisfactory. Participants in the reviewed studies were from diverse health care professions. Medical health professionals were involved in about three-quarters of the studies. Three key benefits of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs were identified: (1) professional networking and collaboration, (2) professional education and training, and (3) patient education and health promotion. For the selected studies, there were five recognized dangers of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs: (1) loosening accountability, (2) compromising confidentiality, (3) blurred professional boundaries, (4) depiction of unprofessional behavior, and (5) legal issues and disciplinary consequences. This scoping review also recognizes recommendations for changes in educational curricula regarding e-professionalism as opportunities for improvement and barriers that influence HCPs use of SM in the context of e-professionalism.

Conclusions:
Findings in the reviewed studies indicate the existence of both benefits and dangers of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs. Even though there are some barriers recognized, this review has highlighted existing recommendations for including e-professionalism in the educational curricula of HCPs. Based on all evidence provided, this review provided new insights and guides for future research on this area. There is a clear need for robust research to investigate new emerging SM platforms, the efficiency of guidelines and educational interventions, and the specifics of each profession regarding their SM potential and use.",1
"Abstract
This present study examined excess copper (Cu) effects on seedling growth, leaf Cu concentration, gas exchange, and protein profiles identified by a two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) based mass spectrometry (MS) approach after Citrus sinensis and Citrus grandis seedlings were treated for six months with 0.5 (control), 200, 300, or 400 μM CuCl2. Forty-one and 37 differentially abundant protein (DAP) spots were identified in Cu-treated C. grandis and C. sinensis leaves, respectively, including some novel DAPs that were not reported in leaves and/or roots. Most of these DAPs were identified only in C. grandis or C. sinensis leaves. More DAPs increased in abundances than DAPs decreased in abundances were observed in Cu-treated C. grandis leaves, but the opposite was true in Cu-treated C. sinensis leaves. Over 50% of DAPs were associated with photosynthesis, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism. Cu-toxicity-induced reduction in leaf CO2 assimilation might be caused by decreased abundances of proteins related to photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC) and CO2 assimilation. Cu-effects on PETC were more pronounced in C. sinensis leaves than in C. grandis leaves. DAPs related to antioxidation and detoxification, protein folding and assembly (viz., chaperones and folding catalysts), and signal transduction might be involved in Citrus Cu-toxicity and Cu-tolerance.

"Abstract
Background: Environmental health is a growing area of knowledge, continually increasing and updating the body of evidence linking the environment to human health. Aim: This study summarizes the epidemiological evidence on environmental risk factors from meta-analyses through an umbrella review. Methods: An umbrella review was conducted on meta-analyses of cohort, case-control, case-crossover, and time-series studies that evaluated the associations between environmental risk factors and health outcomes defined as incidence, prevalence, and mortality. The specific search strategy was designed in PubMed using free text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to risk factors, environment, health outcomes, observational studies, and meta-analysis. The search was limited to English, Spanish, and French published articles and studies on humans. The search was conducted on September 20, 2020. Risk factors were defined as any attribute, characteristic, or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or death. The environment was defined as the external elements and conditions that surround, influence, and affect a human organism or population’s life and development. The environment definition included the physical environment such as nature, built environment, or pollution, but not the social environment. We excluded occupational exposures, microorganisms, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), behavioral risk factors, and no-natural disasters. Results: This umbrella review found 197 associations among 69 environmental exposures and 83 diseases and death causes reported in 103 publications. The environmental factors found in this review were air pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, heavy metals, chemicals, ambient temperature, noise, radiation, and urban residential surroundings. Among these, we identified 65 environmental exposures defined as risk factors and 4 environmental protective factors. In terms of study design, 57 included cohort and/or case-control studies, and 46 included time-series and/or case-crossover studies. In terms of the study population, 21 included children, and the rest included adult population and both sexes. In this review, the largest body of evidence was found in air pollution (91 associations among 14 air pollution definitions and 34 diseases and mortality diagnoses), followed by environmental tobacco smoke with 24 associations. Chemicals (including pesticides) were the third larger group of environmental exposures found among the meta-analyses included, with 19 associations. Conclusion: Environmental exposures are an important health determinant. This review provides an overview of an evolving research area and should be used as a complementary tool to understand the connections between the environment and human health. The evidence presented by this review should help to design public health interventions and the implementation of health in all policies approach aiming to improve populational health.

"Currently, there are very few well-established treatments to stimulate corneal endothelial cell regeneration in vivo as a cure for corneal endothelial dysfunctions. The most frequently performed intervention for a damaged or dysfunctional corneal endothelium nowadays is corneal endothelial keratoplasty, also known as lamellar corneal transplantation surgery. Newer medical therapies are emerging and are targeting the regeneration of the corneal endothelium, helping the patients regain their vision without the need for donor tissue. Alternatives to donor tissues are needed as the aging population requiring transplants, has further exacerbated the pressure on the corneal eye banking system. Significant ongoing research efforts in the field of corneal regenerative medicine have been made to elucidate the underlying pathways and effector proteins involved in corneal endothelial regeneration. However, the literature offers little guidance and selective attention to the question of how to fully exploit these pathways. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of wound healing characteristics from a biochemical level in the lab to the regenerative features seen in the clinic. Studying the pathways involved in corneal wound healing together with their key effector proteins, can help explain the effect on the proliferation and migration capacity of the corneal endothelial cells.",1
"The most recent version of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) was published in 2021. A special, hybrid guidelines meeting was convened by ESMO and the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (KSMO) in collaboration with nine other Asian national oncology societies in May 2022 in order to adapt the ESMO 2021 guidelines to take into account the differences associated with the treatment of MBC in Asia. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by a panel of Asian experts in the treatment of patients with MBC representing the oncological societies of China (CSCO), India (ISMPO), Indonesia (ISHMO), Japan (JSMO), Korea (KSMO), Malaysia (MOS), the Philippines (PSMO), Singapore (SSO), Taiwan (TOS) and Thailand (TSCO). The voting was based on the best available scientific evidence and was independent of drug access or practice restrictions in the different Asian countries. The latter were discussed when appropriate. The aim of these guidelines is to provide guidance for the harmonisation of the management of patients with MBC across the different regions of Asia, drawing from data provided by global and Asian trials whilst at the same time integrating the differences in genetics, demographics and scientific evidence, together with restricted access to certain therapeutic strategies.",1
"Objective: An adaptation of Parent_x0001_Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) with a novel Emotion Development (ED) module has shown efficacy for the
treatment of early childhood depression. Children who received PCIT-ED also showed healthy alterations in neural response to reward. We investigated
whether the novel ED module made a unique contribution to the treatment of depression and neural response to reward, and whether child-directed
intervention (CDI) and parent-directed intervention (PDI) modules (standard elements of PCIT) were also effective.
Method: Dyads who participated in a randomized controlled trial of PCIT that compared the active PCIT-ED to a wait list (WL) condition were
assessed at the completion of each module of PCIT-ED (CDI, PDI, ED) or WL time equivalent for child depression and other symptoms, parenting
styles, stress, and depression. Event-related potentials during a reward task were obtained at the end of standard PCIT and after the novel ED module.
Results: Study findings showed that the ED module as well as some elements of standard PCIT were effective in reducing child depression and other
forms of psychopathology. Changes in the child’s neural response to reward and parental response to child emotional expression were specific to the ED
module.
Conclusion: Study findings suggest that the novel ED module has added efficacy for the treatment of early childhood depression, as well as unique
efficacy in changing neural responses to reward and parenting response to child emotional expression. These findings can inform clinical uses of this
treatment in a modular fashion. Future studies are needed that control for session number and order of PCIT-ED modules.

Abstract
Objective
To investigate the role of ginsenoside Rd (GRd) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell differentiation.

Methods
AML cells were treated with GRd (25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL), retinoic acid (RA, 0.1g/L) and PD98059 (20 mg/mL) for 72 h, cell survival was detected by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and colony formation assays, and cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. Cell morphology and differentiation were observed by Wright-Giemsa staining, peroxidase chemical staining and cellular immunochemistry assay, respectively. The protein expression levels of GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1), purine rich Box-1 (PU.1), phosphorylated-extracellular signal-related kinase (p-ERK), ERK, phosphorylated-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β), GSK3β and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) were detected by Western blot. Thirty-six mice were randomly divided into 3 groups using a random number table: model control group (non-treated), GRd group [treated with 200 mg/(kg·d) GRd] and homoharringtonine (HTT) group [treated with 1 mg/(kg·d) HTT]. A tumor-bearing nude mouse model was established, and tumor weight and volume were recorded. Changes of subcutaneous tumor tissue were observed after hematoxylin and eosin staining. WT1 and GATA-1 expressions were detected by immunohistochemical staining.

Results
The cell survival was inhibited by GRd in a dose-dependent manner and GRd caused G0/G1 cell arrest (p<0.05). GRd treatment induced leukemia cell differentiation, showing increased expressions of peroxidase and specific proteins concerning erythrogenic or granulocytic differentiation (p<0.05). GRd treatment elicited upregulation of p-ERK, p-GSK-3β and STAT1 expressions in cells, and reversed the effects of PD98059 on inhibiting the expressions of peroxidase, GATA-1 and PU.1 (P<0.05). After GRd treatment, tumor weight and volume of mice were decreased, and tumor cells underwent massive apoptosis and necrosis (P<0.05). WT1 level was decreased, and GATA-1 level was significantly increased in subcutaneous tumor tissues (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Conclusion
GRd might induce the differentiation of AML cells via regulating the ERK/GSK-3β signaling pathway.",1
"Abstract
Primary defects in lung branching morphogenesis, resulting in neonatal lethal pulmonary hypoplasias, are incompletely understood. To elucidate the pathogenetics of human lung development, we studied a unique collection of samples obtained from deceased individuals with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed interstitial neonatal lung disorders: acinar dysplasia (n = 14), congenital alveolar dysplasia (n = 2), and other lethal lung hypoplasias (n = 10). We identified rare heterozygous copy-number variant deletions or single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) involving TBX4 (n = 8 and n = 2, respectively) or FGF10 (n = 2 and n = 2, respectively) in 16/26 (61%) individuals. In addition to TBX4, the overlapping ∼2 Mb recurrent and nonrecurrent deletions at 17q23.1q23.2 identified in seven individuals with lung hypoplasia also remove a lung-specific enhancer region. Individuals with coding variants involving either TBX4 or FGF10 also harbored at least one non-coding SNV in the predicted lung-specific enhancer region, which was absent in 13 control individuals with the overlapping deletions but without any structural lung anomalies. The occurrence of rare coding variants involving TBX4 or FGF10 with the putative hypomorphic non-coding SNVs implies a complex compound inheritance of these pulmonary hypoplasias. Moreover, they support the importance of TBX4-FGF10-FGFR2 epithelial-mesenchymal signaling in human lung organogenesis and help to explain the histopathological continuum observed in these rare lethal developmental disorders of the lung.",1

In 2016, UNSCEAR published an attachment to its Fukushima 2015 White Paper, entitled 'Development of isodose maps representing annual external exposure in Japan as a function of time', in which the committee presented an annual additional 1 mSv effective dose ab extra isodose lines for 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 50 years after the accident, based on the soil deposition data of radionuclides within 100 km of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant. Meanwhile, the median of the ratio, c, between the external effective dose rates and the ambient dose equivalent rates 1 m above the ground obtained by airborne monitoring has been established to be 
. Here, we compare the UNSCEAR predictions with estimates based on the airborne monitoring. Although both the methods and the data used in the two approaches are different, the resultant contours show relatively good agreement. However, to improve the accuracy of long-term annual effective isodose lines, feedback from continuous measurements such as airborne monitoring is important.",1
"Abstract
Needle-related procedures are often a source of pain, anxiety and fear in young patients. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) on reducing pain, fear and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing needle-related procedures. Pain, anxiety, fear, changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as satisfaction were evaluated as outcomes during needle-related procedures in VR compared with standard care conditions. A meta-analysis was performed, taking into account online databases. Two authors independently conducted literature searches in December 2020. The last search was conducted in March 2021 from a total of 106 records, 7 met our inclusion criteria. One study was excluded from the meta-analysis due to insufficient data. VR was applied as a distractor during venous access. Statistically significant benefits of using VR were shown in children’s pain scores, where VR significantly decreased symptoms (n = 3204 patients, MD = −2.85; 95% CI −3.57, −2.14, for the Wong–Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale and n = 2240 patients, MD = −0.19; 95% CI −0.58, 0.20, for the Faces Pain Scale—Revised). The analysis of fear, anxiety and satisfaction scores revealed no significant differences between the conditions, as the studies were too heterogeneous to be pooled. Distraction using virtual reality may be an effective intervention for reducing pain in children undergoing needle-related medical procedures. However, further research in the implementation of VR as a distractor for children and adolescents is required, due to the limited research into this field.

"Abstract
Objective:
Data on the neurodevelopmental and associated behavioral effects of light to moderate in utero alcohol exposure are limited. This retrospective investigation tested for associations between reported maternal prenatal alcohol use and psychological, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in substance-naive youths.
Methods:
Participants were 9,719 youths (ages 9.0 to 10.9 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Based on parental reports, 2,518 (25.9%) had been exposed to alcohol in utero. Generalized additive mixed models and multilevel cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models were used to test whether prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with psychological, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes, and whether differences in brain structure and resting-state functional connectivity partially explained these associations at baseline and 1-year follow-up, after controlling for possible confounding factors.
Results:
Prenatal alcohol exposure of any severity was associated with greater psychopathology, attention deficits, and impulsiveness, with some effects showing a dose-dependent response. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure, compared with those without, displayed greater cerebral and regional volume and greater regional surface area. Resting-state functional connectivity was largely unaltered in children with in utero exposure. Some of the psychological and behavioral outcomes at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up were partially explained by differences in brain structure among youths who had been exposed to alcohol in utero.
Conclusions:
Any alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with subtle yet significant psychological and behavioral effects in children. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from conception throughout pregnancy.",1
"Purpose: The extant literature suggests that individual
differences in speech perception can be linked to broad
receptive language phenotype. For example, a recent study
found that individuals with a smaller receptive vocabulary
showed diminished lexically guided perceptual learning
compared to individuals with a larger receptive vocabulary.
Here, we examined (a) whether such individual differences
stem from variation in reliance on lexical information or
variation in perceptual learning itself and (b) whether a
relationship exists between lexical recruitment and lexically
guided perceptual learning more broadly, as predicted by
current models of lexically guided perceptual learning.
Method: In Experiment 1, adult participants (n = 70) completed
measures of receptive and expressive language ability, lexical
recruitment, and lexically guided perceptual learning. In
Experiment 2, adult participants (n = 120) completed the
same lexical recruitment and lexically guided perceptual
learning tasks to provide a high-powered replication of the
primary findings from Experiment 1.
Results: In Experiment 1, individuals with weaker
receptive language ability showed increased lexical
recruitment relative to individuals with higher receptive
language ability; however, receptive language ability did
not predict the magnitude of lexically guided perceptual
learning. Moreover, the results of both experiments
converged to show no evidence indicating a relationship
between lexical recruitment and lexically guided perceptual
learning.
Conclusion: The current findings suggest that (a) individuals
with weaker language ability demonstrate increased reliance
on lexical information for speech perception compared to
those with stronger receptive language ability; (b) individuals
with weaker language ability maintain an intact perceptual
learning mechanism; and, (c) to the degree that the
measures used here accurately capture individual differences
in lexical recruitment and lexically guided perceptual
learning, there is no graded relationship between these two
constructs.",1

Background
Coronary pressure-derived fractional flow reverse (FFR) is the standard of the functional assessment of lesion severity. In spite of its strengths in determining ischemia-related coronary stenosis, the invasive operation involved still limits its clinical application. Coronary computed tomography angiography-derived FFR (CCTA-FFR) or computed tomography-derived FFR (CT-FFR) has been indicated as an effective and non-invasive index to evaluate lesion-specific ischemia. However, its diagnostic performance, especially in patients with different severity of coronary stenosis, remains unknown. The current research attempted to demonstrate this problem and provided the foundation for extensive clinical application of CCTA-FFR.

Methods
The design of this study was a diagnostic test. A total of 97 vessels from 91 patients who performed CCTA and coronary angiography (CAG) during a hospitalization collected from two research centers were included in this study. CCTA-FFR and FFR were obtained by CCTA and CAG separately. The Gensini score was calculated according to the CAG in each patient. FFR was indicated as the golden diagnosis of lesion-specific ischemia with a cut-off value of 0.80, which was consistent with most contemporary studies. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, simple linear analysis, and Bland-Altman plot were performed to determine the diagnostic performance of CCTA-FFR.

Results
CCTA-FFR was well correlated with invasive FFR (R2=0.745, P<0.001) and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.976. The sensitivity was 94.6% and the specificity was 95.1%. The mean difference between FFR and CT-FFR was 0.011, and the 95% confidence interval was −0.173 to 0.196. The AUCs were 0.989 and 0.928 in the low and high Gensini groups, respectively, and there was no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracies between these two groups (Z=0.003, P>0.500). CT-FFR still exhibited a good correlation with FFR (R2=0.713, P<0.001 in the low Gensini group and R2=0.743, P<0.001 in the high Gensini group). The systematic differences were calculated, and the mean difference between FFR and CT-FFR was −0.005 and 0.025, respectively, in these two groups.

Conclusions
CCTA-FFR exhibited good diagnostic performance in patients with different Gensini score levels. Our results indicate that CCTA-FFR could be an effective tool to screen lesion-specific ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.

Background
Infections contribute to 30% of the 2.5 million neonatal deaths that occur globally every year. A
newly cut umbilical cord can be a pathway for bacteria to enter the vulnerable neonate and cause
neonatal sepsis. Most infections are preventable with evidenced-based cord care.
Objective
To assess postnatal mothers’ knowledge and practice of umbilical cord care in the Kibungo
Hospital catchment area in Rwanda.
Methodology
A descriptive cross-sectional study design and purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit
224 postnatal mothers. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive and
inferential statistics were used to analyze data.
Results
A third of mothers (33%) had adequate knowledge, and a half (54%) had good umbilical cord care
practice. The majority (70%) reported dry cord care practice, though many applied substances
including Vaseline (23%) and Movit ointment (15%). There was a negative correlation between
knowledge of cord care and substance applied to cord (R2=0.224, p=0.001), and days applied
(R2=0.167, p=0.012).
Conclusion
The study population had low cord care knowledge. Health care providers need to educate
mothers on the practice of allowing the cord to dry naturally, and discourage the use of harmful
substances that delay cord separation and increase risk of sepsis and subsequent neonatal
mortality.

Background
We aimed to explore the impact of opioid-sparing anesthesia on patients’ quality of recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We tested the primary hypothesis that our predefined opioid-sparing anesthesia provides better quality of patients’ recovery compared to routine anesthesia in VATS.

Methods
Patients between 18 and 70 years, scheduled for elective VATS, had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I–III under general anesthesia, were randomly allocated to: routine anesthesia group and opioid-sparing anesthesia group. Patients in the opioid-sparing anesthesia group were mainly given preoperative thoracic paravertebral blockade with intraoperative withholding longer acting opioids. Patients in routine anesthesia group received opioid-based anesthesia. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-15 scale (QoR-15) at 6 hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes included QoR-15 at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score Satisfaction with pain treatment (OBAS) and acute pain intensity at 6, 24 and 48 hours after surgery, and clinical outcomes of recovery after surgery.

Results
A total of 159 patients were included in final analysis. The median difference in QoR-15 between opioid-sparing anesthesia and routine anesthesia was 4 (95% CI: 1–6) at 6 hours, 8 (95% CI: 4–12) at 24 hours and 4.7 (95% CI: 1–6) at 48 hours after surgery respectively; 73.4% of patient showed good recovery in opioid-sparing anesthesia group, compared to 53.8% in routine anesthesia group at 24 hours after surgery (P=0.01). Patients demonstrated lower OBAS in opioid-sparing anesthesia group compared to routine anesthesia at all time points after surgery (P<0.05). The pain at most was significantly lower in opioid-sparing anesthesia group compared to routine anesthesia at 6 and 48 hours after surgery (P<0.05). Patients exhibited faster recovery with opioid-sparing anesthesia on time to mobilize and time to first flatus (P<0.01).

Conclusions
Our intraoperative opioid-sparing anesthesia cannot improve patients’ recovery at 6 hours after VATS lung surgery, but it demonstrates better outcomes at 24 hours after surgery compared to routine anesthesia, reaching to a clinically important difference.",1
"Abstract
Currently, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is an effective therapy for ischemic stroke (IS). However, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a serious side effect of rtPA therapy and may lead to patients’ death. The natural polyphenol apigenin has a good therapeutic effect on IS. Apigenin has potential BBB protection, but the mechanism by which it protects the BBB integrity is not clear. In this study, we used network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to reveal the mechanisms by which apigenin protects the BBB. Among the 146 targets of apigenin for the treatment of IS, 20 proteins were identified as core targets (e.g., MMP-9, TLR4, STAT3). Apigenin protects BBB integrity by inhibiting the activity of MMPs through anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress. These mechanisms included JAK/STAT, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and Nitrogen metabolism signaling pathways. The findings of this study contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of apigenin in the treatment of BBB disruption and provide ideas for the development of drugs to treat IS.

"Abstract
Background/Aims: Recent studies have indicated that exosomes secreted from adiposederived stem cells (ADSCs) have important effects in the treatment of ischemic injury. However,
the treatment mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether ADSC-derived
exosomes enriched with microRNA (miR)-30d-5p have a protective effect on acute ischemic
stroke (AIS). Methods: In the current study, inflammatory factors and miR-30d-5p expression
were assessed in 70 subjects with AIS and 35 healthy controls. Exosomes were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy and further examined using nanoparticle tracking
analyses. A rat model of AIS and an in vitro model of oxygen- and glucose-deprived (OGD)
primary microglia were established to study the protective mechanism of exosomes from
miR-30d-5p-overexpressing ADSCs in ischemia-induced nerve injury. Results: The results
showed that following AIS, the expression of inflammatory cytokines increased, while the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and miR-30d-5p decreased both in patients and in animal
models. Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that suppression of autophagy significantly
reduced the OGD-induced inflammatory response. In addition, exosome treatment was
more effective in suppressing the inflammatory response by reversing OGD-induced and

exosomes derived from ADSCs significantly decreased the cerebral injury area of infarction by
suppressing autophagy and promoting M2 microglia/macrophage polarization. Conclusions:
Our results suggest that miR-30d-5p-enhanced ADSC-derived exosomes prevent cerebral
injury by inhibiting autophagy-mediated microglial polarization to M1",1
"Abstract
Yeast and cancer cells share the unusual characteristic of favoring fermentation of sugar over respiration. We now reveal an evolutionary conserved mechanism linking fermentation to activation of Ras, a major regulator of cell proliferation in yeast and mammalian cells, and prime proto-oncogene product. A yeast mutant (tps1∆) with overactive influx of glucose into glycolysis and hyperaccumulation of Fru1,6bisP, shows hyperactivation of Ras, which causes its glucose growth defect by triggering apoptosis. Fru1,6bisP is a potent activator of Ras in permeabilized yeast cells, likely acting through Cdc25. As in yeast, glucose triggers activation of Ras and its downstream targets MEK and ERK in mammalian cells. Biolayer interferometry measurements show that physiological concentrations of Fru1,6bisP stimulate dissociation of the pure Sos1/H-Ras complex. Thermal shift assay confirms direct binding to Sos1, the mammalian ortholog of Cdc25. Our results suggest that the Warburg effect creates a vicious cycle through Fru1,6bisP activation of Ras, by which enhanced fermentation stimulates oncogenic potency.

"Abstract
Energy has become an essential part of today’s lifestyle, especially for using the electronic appliances in homes, offices and other built environments in a daily basis. Although in modern life, electronic devices have become ubiquitous, the excessive electromagnetic radiations from these appliances may cause potential health effects. Realizing this significance, a systemic and comprehensive assessment was performed to study the radiation propagation generating from the energy based electric appliances. Along with measuring the radiation exposure in buildings, this study examined how the radiation propagation varies with different construction materials. Moreover, radiation associated human health impacts were also investigated. Evaluation of five building environment demonstrated that drywall acted as the best shielding object (transmission coefficient: 18% electric field strength) whereas lumber and glass wall acted as the poor shielding material (96% and 97% electric field strength respectively). Comparison with the standard values specified by international authorities showed lower field strength values for some regulatory institute, although these values were higher compared to some more restricted safety levels in some countries, indicating the possible human health impacts in the assessed built environment. Hence, this study recommends utilization of proper shielding materials, maintaining exposure distance along with exposure duration reduction.",1

Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of global mortality. We aimed to determine the effect of coffee drinking and sex and their interaction, as well as rs1800588 and rs1800775 polymorphisms on HDL-C levels in Taiwanese adults. Data of 4262 men and 4813 women, aged 30–70 years, were retrieved from Taiwan Biobank. The interaction between sex and coffee drinking on HDL-C was significant (p = 0.0452). Coffee consumption was significantly associated with higher HDL-C levels in only women (β = 0.81679; p = 0.0246). However, rs1800588 and rs1800775 variants were significantly associated with HDL-C in both sexes. In women, β-values were 0.99080; p = 0.0059 and 3.16277; p < 0.0001 for rs1800588 CT and TT genotypes, respectively and −1.80954; p < 0.0001 and −2.81512; p < 0.0001 for rs1800775 AC and CC genotypes, respectively. In men, β-values were 1.32430; p < 0.0001 and 3.24976; p < 0.0001 for rs1800775 CT and TT genotypes, respectively and −1.96232; p < 0.0001 and −2.71536, p < 0.0001 for the AC and CC genotypes, respectively. In conclusion, coffee drinking was significantly associated with higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in women but not men after adjusting for confounders including rs1800588 (LIPC) and rs1800775 (CETP) variants.

"Study Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting & Participants
439,455 non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black US adults initiating dialysis between 2015 and 2019 were identified from the United States Renal Data System, and followed through 2020.
Exposures
Patient race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black) and age group (18-29, 30-49, 50-64, and 65-80 years).
Outcomes
Placement on the United Network for Organ Sharing deceased donor waitlist.
Analytical Approach
Age- and race-stratified waitlisting rates were compared. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, censored for death, examined the association between race and waitlisting, and included interaction term for race and age.
Results
Over a median follow-up period of 1 year, the proportion of non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black patients waitlisted was 20.7% and 20.5%, respectively. In multivariable models, non-Hispanic Black patients were 14% less likely to be waitlisted (aHR, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77-0.95). Relative differences between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White patients were different by age group. Non-Hispanic Black patients were 27%, 12%, and 20% less likely to be waitlisted than non-Hispanic White patients for ages 18-29 years (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86), 50-64 (aHR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98), and 65-80 years (aHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.90), respectively, but differences were attenuated among patients aged 30-49 years (aHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77-1.02).
Limitations
Race and ethnicity data is physician reported, residual confounding, and analysis is limited to non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black patients.
Conclusions
Racial disparities in waitlisting exist between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White individuals and are most pronounced among younger patients with kidney failure. Results suggest that interventions to address inequalities in waitlisting may need to be targeted to younger patients with kidney failure.",1
"Abstract
Purpose
Real-time magnetic resonance (MR) guidance is of interest to various groups globally because the superior soft tissue contrast MR images offer over other x-ray-based imaging modalities. Because of the precision required in proton therapy, proton therapy treatments rely heavily on image guidance. Integrating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into a proton therapy treatment is a challenge. The charged particles (protons) used in proton therapy experience magnetic forces when travelling through the MRI magnetic fields. Given that it is desired that proton beams can be delivered with submillimeter accuracy, it is important that all potential sources of beam displacement are well modeled and understood. This study investigated the behavior of monoenergetic proton beams in the presence of a simulated set of realistic three-dimensional (3D) vector magnetic gradient fields required for spatial localization during imaging. This deflecting source has not been previously investigated.

Methods
Three-dimensional magnetic vector fields from a superconducting 0.5 T open bore MRI magnet model (previously developed in-house) and 3D magnetic fields from an in-house gradient coil model were applied to two types of computer simulations. In all simulations, monoenergetic proton pencil beams (from 80 to 250 MeV) were used. The initial directions of proton beams were varied. In all simulations, the orientation of the B0 field coincided with the positive z-axis in the simulation geometry. The first type of simulation is based on an analytic magnetic force equation (analytic simulations) while the second type is a full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The analytic simulations were limited to propagating the proton beams in vacuum but could be rapidly calculated in a desktop computer while the MC simulations were calculated in a cluster computer. The proton beam locations and dose profiles at the central plane (z = 0 cm) with or without magnetic fields were extracted and used to quantify the effect of the presence of the different magnetic fields on the proton beam.

Results
The analytic simulations agree with MC results within 0.025 mm, thus acting as the verification of MC calculations. The presence of the B0 field caused the beam to follow a helical trajectory which resulted in angular offsets of 4.9o, 3.6o, and 2.8o for the 80, 150, and 250 MeV, respectively. Magnetic field deflections caused by a rapid MRI sequence (bSSFP, with maximum gradient strength of 40 mT/m) show a pattern of distortion which remained spatially invariant in the MR's field of view. For the 80 MeV beam, this pattern shows a maximum ranged in the y direction of 1.5 mm. The presence of the B0 field during the bSSFP simulations adds the same beam rotation to the observed during the B0 only simulations.

Conclusion
This investigation reveals that time-varying gradient magnetic fields required for image generation can cause a small spread in the proton beams used in the study which are independent of the effects arising from the B0 field. Further, studies where clinical beam kernels were convolved with this spread show that these magnetic fields are expected to have an insignificant impact on the beam's entrance dose.",1
"Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are a vital part of the toolkit for the current practice of orthopedic surgery. We are witnessing the expansion of the use of PROMs in clinical practice and in research; the ultimate direction of this expansion is unclear. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the trends in the use of PROMs in major upper limb publications over a 7-year period. We retrospectively reviewed all articles published in 6 of the most influential upper limb orthopedic journals based on impact factor from January 2013 to January 2020. PubMed, Medline, and Embase were used to access the abstracts for all articles published for this period. We included all articles related to shoulder arthroplasty, shoulder instability, rotator cuff surgery, and involving the use of PROMs. There were 4175 articles identified from the selected journals over the chosen time period, of which 607 were eligible for inclusion in the study. The number of articles reporting PROMs increased from 57 in 2013 to 115 in 2019, which was a 102% increase. The total number of PROM usages recorded was 1593 which was comprised of 63 different scoring systems, with each article using a median of 3 different PROMs. The most commonly used score in articles originating from North America was the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (216 uses in 273 articles; 78.1%), from Europe it was the Constant-Murley Score (129 uses in 183 articles; 70.4%), and from Asia it was the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (80 uses in 126 articles; 63.4%). The use of PROMs is evolving with an increasing prevalence of and diversity of PROMs being used in upper limb surgery. There is geographical variation in the use of PROMs, and a variety of systems used, with only 3 of the top 10 most used PROMs reporting on patient satisfaction or wellbeing. Given that a diverse range of PROMs study a diverse range of conditions and procedures, there may not be a need for a consensus on the best overall use of PROMs, but there may be ideal PROMs suited to answer specific questions.",1
"Purpose: To determine recent incidence and visual outcomes for acute-onset endophthalmitis after cataract
surgery performed in the United States.
Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Participants: United States cataract surgery patients, 2013-2017 (5 401 686 patients).
Methods: Cases of acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis occurring within 30 days after cataract
surgery were identified using diagnosis codes in the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS (Intelligent
Research in Sight) Registry database, drawn from electronic health records in ophthalmology practices
across the nation. Annual and aggregate 5-year incidences were determined for all cataract surgeries
and specifically for standalone procedures versus those combined with other ophthalmic surgeries.
Patient characteristics were compared. Mean and median visual acuity was determined at 1 month preoperative as well as 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperative among patients with and without
endophthalmitis.
Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract
surgery.
Results: A total of 8 542 838 eyes underwent cataract surgery, 3629 of which developed acute-onset
endophthalmitis (0.04%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04%e0.04%). Endophthalmitis incidence was highest
among patients aged 0 to 17 years (0.37% over 5 years), followed by patients aged 18 to 44 years (0.18% over 5
years; P < 0.0001). Endophthalmitis occurred 4 times more often after combined cases (cataract with other
ophthalmic procedures) than after standalone cataract surgeries (0.20% vs. 0.04% of cases), and occurred in
0.35% of patients receiving anterior vitrectomy. Mean 3-month postoperative visual acuity was 20/100 (median,
20/50) among endophthalmitis patients, versus a mean of approximately 20/40 (median, 20/30) among patients
without endophthalmitis. However, 4% of endophthalmitis patients still achieved 20/20 or better visual acuity, and
44% achieved 20/40 or better visual acuity at 3 months.
Conclusions: Acute-onset endophthalmitis occurred in 0.04% of 8 542 838 cataract surgeries performed in
the United States between 2013 and 2017. Risk factors may include younger age, cataract surgery combined with
other ophthalmic surgeries, and anterior vitrectomy. Visual acuity outcomes vary; however, patients can recover
excellent vision after surgery. Big data from clinical registries like the IRIS Registry has great potential for
evaluating rare conditions such as endophthalmitis, including developing benchmarks, longer-term time trend
investigation, and comprehensive analysis of risk factors and prophylaxis. Ophthalmology 2019;-:1e8 Published

"Abstract
Background
Most questionnaires currently used for assessing symptomatology of vestibular disorders are retrospective, inducing recall bias and lowering ecological validity. An app-based diary, administered multiple times in daily life, could increase the accuracy and ecological validity of symptom measurement. The objective of this study was to introduce a new experience sampling method (ESM) based vestibular diary app (DizzyQuest), evaluate response rates, and to provide examples of DizzyQuest outcome measures which can be used in future research.

Methods
Sixty-three patients diagnosed with a vestibular disorder were included. The DizzyQuest consisted of four questionnaires. The morning- and evening-questionnaires were administered once each day, the within-day-questionnaire 10 times a day using a semi-random time schedule, and the attack questionnaire could be completed after the occurrence of a vertigo or dizziness attack. Data were collected for 4 weeks. Response rates and loss-to-follow-up were determined. Reported symptoms in the within-day-questionnaire were compared within and between patients and subgroups of patients with different vestibular disorders.

Results
Fifty-one patients completed the study period. Average response rates were significantly higher than the desired response rate of > 50% (p < 0.001). The attack-questionnaire was used 159 times. A variety of neuro-otological symptoms and different disease profiles were demonstrated between patients and subgroups of patients with different vestibular disorders.

Conclusion
The DizzyQuest is able to capture vestibular symptoms within their psychosocial context in daily life, with little recall bias and high ecological validity. The DizzyQuest reached the desired response rates and showed different disease profiles between subgroups of patients with different vestibular disorders. This is the first time ESM was used to assess daily symptoms and quality of life in vestibular disorders, showing that it might be a useful tool in this population.",1
"Abstract
Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) are widely used for temporal complexity analysis of real-world phenomena. However, their relationship with the Hurst exponent as a measure of self-similarity is not widely studied. Additionally, ApEn and SampEn are susceptible to signal amplitude changes. A common practice for addressing this issue is to correct their input signal amplitude by its standard deviation. In this study, we first show, using simulations, that ApEn and SampEn are related to the Hurst exponent in their tolerance r and embedding dimension m parameters. We then propose a modification to ApEn and SampEn called range entropy or RangeEn. We show that RangeEn is more robust to nonstationary signal changes, and it has a more linear relationship with the Hurst exponent, compared to ApEn and SampEn. RangeEn is bounded in the tolerance r-plane between 0 (maximum entropy) and 1 (minimum entropy) and it has no need for signal amplitude correction. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical usefulness of signal entropy measures for characterisation of epileptic EEG data as a real-world example.

"Abstract
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility and skin extensibility and is often accompanied by chronic pain. Rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) can be defined as the stimulation of the senses in a periodic manner within a range of low frequencies. Music plus sound delivered through a vibroacoustic device is a form of RSS and has demonstrated utility in managing pain. In this current study, we conducted an open-label pilot study of 15 patients with hypermobile EDS using RSS as the intervention. Posttreatment improvements were seen in 11 of the 15 patients (73%), whereas 3 of the 15 patients (20%) experienced worse outcomes. Of the 14 patients that completed the experiment, 6 participants (43%) were classified as “responders” to the device while 8 participants (57%) were classified as “nonresponders.” Responders demonstrated significant improvements in pain interference (51.5 ± 16 preintervention vs. 43.5 ± 16.4 postintervention BPI score) and depression symptoms (34.0 ± 15.9 preintervention vs. 26.8 ± 12.1 postintervention CESD score). Poststudy interviews confirm the improvements of pain interference, mood, and bowel symptoms. Furthermore, analysis of medical conditions within the responder group indicates that the presence of depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia may indicate a greater likelihood for patients to benefit with vibroacoustic applications. These results indicate a possible potential for RSS, delivered using a vibroacoustic device, in managing pain-related symptoms. Further research is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the physiological benefits of RSS.",1
"ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent disease and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Although many studies have partially revealed the occurrence and development process of MDD, the
pathogeny and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis
(WGCNA) was used to explore the co-expression modules and hub genes in MDD. A protein–protein interaction
(PPI) network of the most significant module and a TF-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network of MDD were constructed using bioinformatics analysis tools. A KEGG pathway and gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment
analysis of the genes in the significant module was performed using DAVID. Five hub genes in the PPI network
and 10 genes in the TF-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network with high degree values were identified, which may
provide new insights for the investigation of key pathways, diagnostic bio-markers, and therapeutic targets of
MDD. This study brings a novel perspective and provides valuable information to explore the molecular
mechanism of MDD. ",1
"Abstract
The psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) measures one’s behavioral alertness. It is a visual test that involves measuring the speed at which a person reacts to visual stimuli over a fixed time frame (e.g., 5 min). The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of an energy drink on psychomotor vigilance as well as a simple measure of muscular endurance (i.e., push-ups). A total of 20 exercise-trained men (n = 11) and women (n = 9) (mean ± SD: age 32 ± 7 years; height 169 ± 10 cm; weight; 74.5 ± 14.5 kg; percent body fat 20.3 ± 6.2%; years of training 14 ± 9; daily caffeine intake 463 ± 510 mg) volunteered for this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. In a randomized counterbalanced order, they consumed either the energy drink (ED) (product: BANG®, Weston Florida) or a similar tasting placebo drink (PL). In the second visit after a 1-week washout period, they consumed the alternate drink. A full 30 min post-consumption, they performed the following tests in this order: a 5-min psychomotor vigilance test, three sets of push-ups, followed once more by a 5-min psychomotor vigilance test. Reaction time was recorded. For the psychomotor vigilance test, lapses, false starts and efficiency score are also assessed. There were no differences between groups for the number of push-ups that were performed or the number of false starts during the psychomotor vigilance test. However, the ED treatment resulted in a significantly lower (i.e., faster) psychomotor vigilance mean reaction time compared to the PL (p = 0.0220) (ED 473.8 ± 42.0 milliseconds, PL 482.4 ± 54.0 milliseconds). There was a trend for the ED to lower the number of lapses (i.e., reaction time > 500 milliseconds) (p = 0.0608). The acute consumption of a commercially available ED produced a significant improvement in psychomotor vigilance in exercise-trained men and women.

"Inhibition of notch signaling is known to induce differentiation of endocrine cells in zebrafish and mouse. After performing an unbiased in vivo screen of ∼2,200 small molecules in zebrafish, we identified an inhibitor of Cdk5 (roscovitine), which potentiated the formation of β-cells along the intrapancreatic duct during concurrent inhibition of notch signaling. We confirmed and characterized the effect with a more selective Cdk5 inhibitor, (R)-DRF053, which specifically increased the number of duct-derived β-cells without affecting their proliferation. By duct-specific overexpression of the endogenous Cdk5 inhibitors Cdk5rap1 or Cdkal1 (which previously have been linked to diabetes in genome-wide association studies), as well as deleting cdk5, we validated the role of chemical Cdk5 inhibition in β-cell differentiation by genetic means. Moreover, the cdk5 mutant zebrafish displayed an increased number of β-cells independently of inhibition of notch signaling, in both the basal state and during β-cell regeneration. Importantly, the effect of Cdk5 inhibition to promote β-cell formation was conserved in mouse embryonic pancreatic explants, adult mice with pancreatic ductal ligation injury, and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Thus, we have revealed a previously unknown role of Cdk5 as an endogenous suppressor of β-cell differentiation and thereby further highlighted its importance in diabetes.",1
"Abstract
Dendritic growth is essential for the establishment of a functional nervous system. Among extrinsic signals that control dendritic development, substantial evidence indicates that BDNF regulates dendritic morphology. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which BDNF controls dendritic growth. In this study, we show that the MAPK signaling pathway and the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) mediate the effects of BDNF on dendritic length and complexity. However, phosphorylation of CREB alone is not sufficient for the stimulation of dendritic growth by BDNF. Thus, using a mutant form of CREB unable to bind CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC1), we demonstrate that this effect also requires a functional interaction between CREB and CRTC1. Moreover, inhibition of CRTC1 expression by shRNA-mediated knockdown abolished BDNF-induced dendritic growth of cortical neurons. Interestingly, we found that nuclear translocation of CRTC1 results from activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate, a process that is essential for the effects of BDNF on dendritic development. Together, these data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which CREB and the coactivator CRTC1 mediate the effects of BDNF on dendritic growth.",1

Background
Early diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis is of great significance for regression. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. We did this study to explore the factors associated with the clinical diagnosis of neurosyphilis and assess their accuracy for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 100 cases of syphilis patients who underwent lumbar puncture at a major dermatology hospital in Guangzhou, China between April 2013 and November 2016. Fifty patients who were clinically diagnosed with neurosyphilis were selected as case group. Control group consisted of 50 general syphilis patients who were matched with age and gender. The records of patients were reviewed to collect data of socio-demographic information, clinical symptom, and laboratory indicators. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore diagnostic indictors, and ROC analysis was used to assess diagnostic accuracy.

Results
Neurological symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 59.281, 95% CI:5.215–662.910, P = 0.001), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) titer (OR = 1.004, 95% CI:1.002–1.006, P < 0.001), CSF protein (OR = 1.005, 95% CI:1.000–1.009, P = 0.041), and CSF white blood cell (WBC) (OR = 1.120, 95% CI:1.017–1.233, P = 0.021) were found to be statistically associated with neurosyphilis. In ROC analysis, CSF TPPA titer had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 84%, and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.941.

Conclusion
CSF TPPA can potentially be considered as an alternative test for diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Combining with neurological symptoms, CSF protein, CSF WBC, the diagnosis would have a higher sensitivity.

"Introduction: Drug repurposing is a promising strategy to develop new treatments for glioblastoma. In this phase II clinical trial, we evaluated the addition of chlorpromazine to temozolomide in the adjuvant phase of the standard first-line therapeutic protocol in patients with unmethylated MGMT gene promoter.

Methods: This was a multicenter phase II single-arm clinical trial. The experimental procedure involved the combination of CPZ with standard treatment with TMZ in the adjuvant phase of the Stupp protocol in newly-diagnosed GBM patients carrying an unmethylated MGMT gene promoter. Progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and toxicity.

Results: Forty-one patients were evaluated. Twenty patients (48.7%) completed 6 cycles of treatment with TMZ+CPZ. At 6 months, 27 patients (65.8%) were without progression, achieving the primary endpoint. Median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.0-9.0). Median OS was 15.0 months (95% CI: 13.1-16.9). Adverse events led to reduction or interruption of CPZ dosage in 4 patients (9.7%).

Discussion: The addition of CPZ to standard TMZ in the first-line treatment of GBM patients with unmethylated MGMT gene promoter was safe and led to a longer PFS than expected in this population of patients. These findings provide proof-of-concept for the potential of adding CPZ to standard TMZ treatment in GBM patients with unmethylated MGMT gene promoter.

Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of colchicine therapy in pediatric patients with PFAPA syndrome who present with an incomplete response to the standard treatment or with frequent episodes (an interval of less than 14 days between two disease flares).

Methods
A multicenter cohort study of children diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome and treated with colchicine was performed in three separate hospitals located in Spain. The patients clinical and laboratory data were reviewed by accessing their medical records. Response to colchicine was evaluated after 12 months of treatment for frequency, duration, and intensity of PFAPA episodes.

Results
A total of 13 children were included in our study, 43% of whom were boys. Median age of the colchicine therapy initiation was 6 years (interquartile range (IQR)=3–9.5). Following a 12-month period of colchicine therapy (median dosage of 0.02 mg/kg/day; IQR=0.02–0.03), a significant decrease in the median number of flares (median 8; IQR=7–14 vs 3; IQR=2–4; p=0.005) and the duration of disease episodes (median 4 days; IQR=3.25–5.125 vs 1 day; IQR=1–2; p=0.003) was observed. Furthermore, the highest degree of fever during disease flares was reduced from median 40ºC (IQR=39.5–40) to 38.5ºC (IQR=37.7–38.9) (p=0.002).

Conclusion
Colchicine therapy decreased the frequency and intensity of PFAPA. The use of colchicine could be an effective treatment in pediatric patients with PFAPA syndrome who present with frequent or severe relapses.

Background
This study aims to explore if the arthroscopically assisted reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) technique is superior to the traditional open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) technique in the treatment of tibial lateral plateau fractures.

Methods
Forty patients with tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker type I–III) treated with ARIF or ORIF from 2012 to 2017 were included in this retrospective study. All patients received pre-operative radiographs and CT scans. The patients were divided into two groups (ARIF or ORIF). All patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months and an average follow-up of 44.4 months. The clinical and radiographic outcomes were evaluated according to the Knee Society Score (KSS) and the modified Rasmussen radiological score.

Results
Satisfactory clinical and radiological results were found in 39 out of 40 (97.5%) patients. KSS and modified Rasmussen radiological score were significantly better in ARIF group. The mean KSS was 92.37 (± 6.3) for the ARIF group and 86.29 (± 11.54) for the ORIF group (p < 0.05). The mean modified Rasmussen radiographic score was 8.42 (± 2.24) for the ARIF group and 7.33 (± 1.83) for the ORIF group (p = 0.104). Worst clinical and radiological results were related to concomitant intra-articular lesions (p < 0.05). Meniscal tears were found and treated in 17 out of 40 (42.5%) patients. The overall complication rate was 10%.

Conclusions
Both ARIF and ORIF provided a satisfactory outcome for the treatment of Schatzker I–III tibial plateau fractures. However, ARIF led to better clinical results than ORIF. No statistically significant differences were found in perioperative complications, radiological results, and post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis.",1
"ABSTRACT
Objective
To examine several risk and protective factors as predictors of future gun violence among male juvenile offenders.

Method
Data came from a longitudinal cohort of 1,170 male juvenile offenders (42.1% Black; 34.0% Latino; 19.2% White) ages 14–19 who were adjudicated for a serious offense. Interviews were conducted with participants every 6 months for 3 years and then annually for 4 years. The outcome was self-reported gun violence assessed at each follow-up. The time-lagged predictors included several self-reported risk factors (i.e., gun carrying, non-gun violence, drug dealing, heavy drinking, poor impulse control, rewards for crime, peer gun carrying, peer non-gun delinquency, gang membership) and protective factors (i.e., concern for others, expectations, and aspirations for work/family, religious beliefs, adult social supports). The data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models.

Results
There were 266 participants who reported engaging in gun violence at one or more assessments. Gun carrying was a significant predictor of future gun violence; however, nearly half (49%) of the juveniles who reported gun carrying across the repeated assessments did not report engaging in gun violence. Besides gun carrying, several risk (i.e., drug dealing, heavy drinking, rewards for crime, gang membership, peer gun carrying) and protective (i.e., concern for others, aspirations for work/family, religious beliefs, adult social supports) factors significantly predicted gun violence, after controlling for their co-occurrence (Risk factor odds ratios = 1.18–1.50; Protective factor odds ratios =.44-.87; ps<.05).

Conclusions
Interventions designed to prevent gun violence among juvenile offenders should reduce targeted risk factors, while strengthening protective factors that may offset these risks.",1

Background: In view of the large heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE), great efforts are being made towards detecting measurable biological determinants of disease severity that can help to improve the management of
the disease. Considering the central role that plasma kallikrein plays in bradykinin production, we investigated the
contribution of the functional polymorphism KLKB1 -428G/A
to the disease phenotype. Methods: We studied 249 C1-INHHAE patients from 114 European families, and we explored
possible associations of C1-INH-HAE clinical features with
carriage of KLKB1 -428G/A, combined or not with that of the
functional F12 -46C/T polymorphism. Results: Carriers of the
G allele of the KLKB1 -428G/A polymorphism exhibited a significantly delayed disease onset (i.e., by 4.1 years [ p < 0.001],
depending on the zygocity status), while carriers of both the KLKB1 -428G/A and the F12 -46C/T polymorphism displayed
an 8.8-year delay in disease onset ( p < 0.001) and a 64% lower probability of needing long-term prophylactic treatment
( p = 0.019). Conclusions: These findings support our initial
hypothesis that functional alterations in genes of proteins
involved in bradykinin metabolism and function affect the
clinical phenotype and possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of C1-INH-HAE. Given that an earlier onset of symptoms
is inversely correlated with the subsequent course of the disease and, eventually, the need for long-term prophylaxis,
these polymorphisms may be helpful prognostic biomarkers
of disease severity. ",1
"Telomerase replenishes telomere tracts by reiteratively copying its RNA template, TER. Unlike other model
organisms, Arabidopsis thaliana harbors two divergent TER genes. However, only TER1 is required for telomere
maintenance. Here we examine the function of TER2. We show that TER2 is spliced and its 39 end is truncated in
vivo to generate a third TER isoform, TER2S. TERT preferentially associates with TER2 > TER1 > TER2S. Moreover,
TER2 and TER2S assemble with Ku and POT1b (protection of telomeres), forming RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complexes
distinct from TER1 RNP. Plants null for TER2 display increased telomerase enzyme activity, while TER2
overexpression inhibits telomere synthesis from TER1 and leads to telomere shortening. These findings argue that
TER2 negatively regulates telomerase by sequestering TERT in a nonproductive RNP complex. Introduction of DNA
double-strand breaks by zeocin leads to an immediate and specific spike in TER2 and a concomitant decrease in
telomerase enzyme activity. This response is not triggered by replication stress or telomere dysfunction and is
abrogated in ter2 mutants. We conclude that Arabidopsis telomerase is modulated by TER2, a novel DNA damageinduced noncoding RNA that works in concert with the canonical TER to promote genome integrity",1
"Abstract
Traditional Chinese medicine is recently emerged as anti-cancer therapy or adjuvant with reduced side-effects and improved quality of life. In the present study, an active ingredient, 1,6,7-trihydroxyxanthone (THA), derived from Goodyera oblongifolia was found to strongly suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in liver cancer cells. MicroRNAs are a group of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels. Our results demonstrated that miR-218 was up-regulated and oncogene Bmi-1 was down-regulated by THA treatment. Further investigation showed that THA-induced-miR-218 up-regulation could lead to activation of tumor suppressor P16Ink4a and P14ARF, the main down-stream targets of Bmi-1. In conclusion, THA might be a potential anti-cancer drug candidate, at least in part, through the activation of miR-218 and suppression of Bmi-1 expression.

Background
Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular death among patients with chronic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. Whether SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in patients with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction remains less certain.
Methods
We randomly assigned 6263 patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40% to receive dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or matching placebo, in addition to usual therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (which was defined as either an unplanned hospitalization for heart failure or an urgent visit for heart failure) or cardiovascular death, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis.

Download a PDF of the Research Summary.
Results
Over a median of 2.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 512 of 3131 patients (16.4%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 610 of 3132 patients (19.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.92; P<0.001). Worsening heart failure occurred in 368 patients (11.8%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 455 patients (14.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.91); cardiovascular death occurred in 231 patients (7.4%) and 261 patients (8.3%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.05). Total events and symptom burden were lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. Results were similar among patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% or more and those with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%, and results were similar in prespecified subgroups, including patients with or without diabetes. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.
Conclusions
Dapagliflozin reduced the combined risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with heart failure and a mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. (Funded by AstraZeneca; DELIVER ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03619213.)",1
"Abstract
Aims
We investigated reciprocal prospective relationships between multiple behavioural impulsivity tasks (assessing delay discounting, risk-taking and disinhibition) and alcohol involvement (consumption, drunkenness and problems) among adolescents. We hypothesized that performance on the tasks would predict subsequent alcohol involvement, and that alcohol involvement would lead to increases in behavioural impulsivity over time.

Design
Cross-lagged prospective design in which impulsivity and alcohol involvement were assessed five times over 2 years (once every 6 months, on average).

Setting
Classrooms in secondary schools in North West England.

Participants
Two hundred and eighty-seven adolescents (51.2% male) who were aged 12 or 13 years at study enrolment.

Measurements
Participants reported their alcohol involvement and completed computerized tasks of disinhibition, delay discounting and risk-taking at each assessment. Cross-sectional and prospective relationships between the variables of interest were investigated using cross-lagged analyses.

Findings
All behavioural impulsivity tasks predicted a composite index of alcohol involvement 6 months later (all Ps < 0.01), and these prospective relationships were reliable across the majority of time-points. Importantly, we did not observe the converse relationship across time: alcohol involvement did not predict performance on behavioural impulsivity tasks at any subsequent time point.

Conclusions
Several measures of impulsivity predict escalation in alcohol involvement in young adolescents, but alcohol use does not appear to alter impulsivity.",1
"ABSTRACT
Objectives: To conduct the first systematic review
from an epidemiological perspective regarding the
association between high-heeled shoe wear and
hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis
(OA) and both first-party and second-party injury in
human participants without prior musculoskeletal
conditions.
Setting: A systematic review of international peerreviewed scientific literature across seven major
languages.
Data sources: Searches were conducted on seven
major bibliographic databases in July 2015 to initially
identify all scholarly articles on high-heeled shoes.
Supplementary manual searches were conducted.
Titles, abstracts and full-text articles were sequentially
screened to identify all articles assessing
epidemiological evidence regarding the association
between high-heeled shoe wear and hallux valgus,
musculoskeletal pain, OA and both first-party and
second-party injury in human participants without prior
musculoskeletal conditions. Standardised data
extraction and quality assessment (Threats to Validity
tool) were conducted.
Primary and secondary outcome measures:
Musculoskeletal pain or OA as assessed by clinical
diagnosis or clinical assessment tool. First-party or
second-party injury.
Results: 644 unique records were identified, 56 fulltext articles were screened and 18 studies included
in the review. Four studies assessed the relationship
with hallux valgus and three found a significant
association. Two studies assessed the association
with OA and neither found a significant association.
Five studies assessed the association with
musculoskeletal pain and three found a significant
association. Eight studies assessed first-party injury
and seven found evidence of a significant injury toll
associated with high-heeled shoes. One study
provided data on second-party injury and the injury
toll was low.
Conclusions: High-heeled shoes were shown to be
associated with hallux valgus, musculoskeletal pain
and first-party injury. No conclusive evidence
regarding OA and second-party injury was found.
Societal and clinical relevance of these findings is
discussed. Concern is expressed about the
expectation to wear high-heeled shoes in some work
and social situations and access by children.",1

Background
Intracoronary imaging modalities, including intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), provide valuable supplemental data unavailable on coronary angiography (CA) and have shown to improve clinical outcomes. We sought to compare the clinical efficacy of IVUS, OCT, and conventional CA-guided percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

Methods
Frequentist and Bayesian network meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials were performed to compare clinical outcomes of PCI performed with IVUS, OCT, or CA alone.

Results
A total of 28 trials comprising 12,895 patients were included. IVUS when compared with CA alone was associated with a significantly reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (risk ratio: [RR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval: [CI] 0.63–0.88), cardiac death (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43–0.94), target lesion revascularization (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.57–0.80), and target vessel revascularization (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.50–0.81). No differences in comparative clinical efficacy were found between IVUS and OCT. Rank probability analysis bestowed the highest probability to IVUS in ranking as the best imaging modality for all studied outcomes except for all-cause mortality.

Conclusion
Compared with CA, the use of IVUS in PCI guidance provides significant benefit in reducing MACE, cardiac death, and revascularization. OCT had similar outcomes to IVUS, but more dedicated studies are needed to confirm the superiority of OCT over CA.",1
"Abstract
Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitously characterized by debilitating social impairments. These difficulties are thought to emerge from aberrant social inference. In order to elucidate the underlying computational mechanisms, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 29), schizophrenia (N = 31), and borderline personality disorder (N = 31) as well as healthy controls (N = 34) performed a probabilistic reward learning task in which participants could learn from social and non-social information. Patients with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder performed more poorly on the task than healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. Broken down by domain, borderline personality disorder patients performed better in the social compared to the non-social domain. In contrast, controls and major depressive disorder patients showed the opposite pattern and schizophrenia patients showed no difference between domains. In effect, borderline personality disorder patients gave up a possible overall performance advantage by concentrating their learning in the social at the expense of the non-social domain. We used computational modeling to assess learning and decision-making parameters estimated for each participant from their behavior. This enabled additional insights into the underlying learning and decision-making mechanisms. Patients with borderline personality disorder showed slower learning from social and non-social information and an exaggerated sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility, both in the non-social and the social domain, but more so in the latter. Regarding decision-making the modeling revealed that compared to controls and major depression patients, patients with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia showed a stronger reliance on social relative to non-social information when making choices. Depressed patients did not differ significantly from controls in this respect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion of a general interpersonal hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia based on a shared computational mechanism characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs about others in making decisions and by an exaggerated need to make sense of others during learning specifically in borderline personality disorder.

"Abstract
A practice team-based exercise programme with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and case management for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care showed significant positive effects. Here, we analyse the long-term effects (>5 years) of this intervention in the stressful context of the Covid-19 pandemic. All participants of the original PARADIES cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT; 2012–2016) were invited to participate in a follow-up during the Covid-19 pandemic. Clinical outcomes were anxiety symptoms, number and severity of panic attacks, agoraphobic avoidance behaviour, Covid-specific anxiety symptom severity, depression, and patient assessment of chronic illness care. Data were analysed cross-sectionally for group differences (intervention, control) and longitudinally (T0: baseline, T1: 6 months and TCorona: >60 months). Of the original 419 participants, 100 participated in the 60 months follow-up (October 2020-May 2021). In the cross-sectional analysis, the anxiety symptom severity in the intervention group was lower than in the control group (p = .011, Cohen‘s d = .517). In the longitudinal analysis, both groups showed an increase of anxiety and depression symptoms compared to pre-pandemic level. The intervention may have had a lasting impact regarding anxiety severity despite the challenging context of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we cannot say to what extend the intervention still played a role in participants’ lives; other factors may also have helped with coping. The increase of anxiety and depression symptoms in both groups over time could be attributed to external circumstances.",1
"Abstract
The recent increase in the global incidence of dengue fever resulted in over 2.7 million cases in Latin America and many cases in Southeast Asia and has warranted the development and application of early warning systems (EWS) for futuristic outbreak prediction. EWS pertaining to dengue outbreaks is imperative; given the fact that dengue is linked to environmental factors owing to its dominance in the tropics. Prediction is an integral part of EWS, which is dependent on several factors, in particular, climate, geography, and environmental factors. In this study, we explore the role of increased susceptibility to a DENV serotype and climate variability in developing novel predictive models by analyzing RT-PCR and DENV-IgM confirmed cases in Singapore and Honduras, which reported high dengue incidence in 2019 and 2020, respectively. A random-sampling-based susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model was used to obtain estimates of the susceptible fraction for modeling the dengue epidemic, in addition to the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique that was used to fit the model to Singapore and Honduras case report data from 2012 to 2020. Regression techniques were used to implement climate variability in two methods: a climate-based model, based on individual climate variables, and a seasonal model, based on trigonometrically varying transmission rates. The seasonal model accounted for 98.5% and 92.8% of the variance in case count in the 2020 Singapore and 2019 Honduras outbreaks, respectively. The climate model accounted for 75.3% and 68.3% of the variance in Singapore and Honduras outbreaks respectively, besides accounting for 75.4% of the variance in the major 2013 Singapore outbreak, 71.5% of the variance in the 2019 Singapore outbreak, and over 70% of the variance in 2015 and 2016 Honduras outbreaks. The seasonal model accounted for 14.2% and 83.1% of the variance in the 2013 and 2019 Singapore outbreaks, respectively, in addition to 91% and 59.5% of the variance in the 2015 and 2016 Honduras outbreaks, respectively. Autocorrelation lag tests showed that the climate model exhibited better prediction dynamics for Singapore outbreaks during the dry season from May to August and in the rainy season from June to October in Honduras. After incorporation of susceptible fractions, the seasonal model exhibited higher accuracy in predicting outbreaks of higher case magnitude, including those of the 2019–2020 dengue epidemic, in comparison to the climate model, which was more accurate in outbreaks of smaller magnitude. Such modeling studies could be further performed in various outbreaks, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to understand the outbreak dynamics and predict the occurrence of future outbreaks.",1
"Abstract
MiRNAs may promote or inhibit tumor recurrence and drug resistance. MiR-139-5p is reportedly downregulated in colorectal cancer patient samples, but it is unknown whether and how miR-139-5p regulates drug resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are postulated to be important promoters of multiple drug resistance (MDR). In this study, we established a MDR cell model which strongly expressed the CSC-associated biomarkers CD44 and CD133. MiR-139-5p expression was reduced in MDR cell lines, while overexpression of miR-139-5p reversed CD44+/CD133+-associated MDR. We also identified NOTCH1, an important protein for stem cell maintenance and function, as a direct target of miR-139-5p, both in vitro and in a knockout mouse model. Notch1 expression was upregulated in tumor samples and inversely correlated with expression of miR-139-5p. Silencing NOTCH1 exerted an effect similar to overexpression of miR-139-5p by inhibiting the CD44+ and CD133+ population and reversing the drug-resistant phenotype. In conclusion, miR-139-5p downregulated NOTCH1 signaling to reverse CD44+/CD133+-associated MDR in colorectal cancer cells. Given this insight into the miRNA regulation of MDR, miR-139-5p could be a promising therapeutic target for colorectal cancer therapy.

"ABSTRACT
Background: Determination of Toxoplasma gondii genotypes plays an important role in the health management
and epidemiology of toxoplasmosis. We developed HRM analysis to differentiate genotypes of T. gondii using the
B1 and ROP8 genes, through comparing the sensitivity and specificity of both genes and methods used for the
detection of T. gondii.
Methods: A total of 96 DNA samples of muscle tissue of livestock and poultry brain tissue with three standard
strains RH (type I), PRU (type II) and VEG (type III) were prepared and analyzed. Three methods of nested PCR,
PCR-PCR and nested-qPCR-HRM were used. Specific new primers were designed and synthesized for developing
HRM. Thirty positive samples obtained from nested-qPCR-HRM were sequenced (18 B1 and 12 ROP8).
Results: Overall, 87 infected samples were identified using both genes. Through the B1 gene, we could separate
type I (Tm = 84.8 ◦C) from II/III types (Tm = 84.6 ◦C). Also, the ROP8 gene could separate type II (Tm = 84.5 ◦C)
from I/III types (Tm = 84.12 ◦C). Highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (78.72%) were observed by nestedqPCR-HRM assays of the B1 and ROP8 genes than by other methods, respectively. Thus, the B1 gene can be used
to most accurately detect T. gondii, while the ROP8 gene was more appropriate for T. gondii genotyping. PCRsequencing results were consistent with HRM results in most selected samples.
Conclusion: HRM analysis is a powerful diagnostic tool for rapid detection and determination of main clonal
lineages, and even unusual T. gondii genotypes. ",1

Purpose: To evaluate the effect of intravitreal (IV) Matrine (Mat) injection on retinal endothelial cell proliferation (REP), retinal morphology,
and apoptotic activity in hyperoxia induced (HIR) in-Vivo ROP- mouse model using C57BL/6J.
Methods: Total of 48 C57BL/6J mice were divided in 6 group each including 8. Group A and B-S exposed to room air were negative control
groups; group C, D-S, E and F exposed to 75% ± 2% oxygen from postnatal day (PD) 7 to PD 12 comprised HIR groups. Group C and D-S were
control groups, group E and F were low and high dose IV-Mat injected groups. Group A and C received no IV injection, B-S and D-S received 1
μL IV sterile 0.9% NaCl injection, E and F received 0.78μg and 6.25μg IV-Mat injection respectively. After enucleation, we measured REP by
counting neovascular tufts in cross-sections and examined histological, ultrastructural changes via light and transmission electron microscope.
Apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling.
Results: No REP was detected in negative control groups. REP levels were signifi cantly different between low- and high-dose Mat groups.
REP levels were signifi cantly lower in the Mat groups, compared to the control groups. The incidence of mitochondrial dysmorphology and
apoptosis were lower in groups receiving Mat compared to the control groups.
Conclusion: Mat seems to suppress REP and has anti-apoptotic activity in the HIR mouse model.

"Abstract
The association between the dissemination of scientific articles on Twitter and online visibility (as assessed by the Altmetric Score) is still controversial, and the impact on citation rates has never been rigorously addressed for cardiovascular medicine journals using a randomized design. The ESC Journals Study randomized 695 papers published in the ESC Journal Family (March 2018–May 2019) for promotion on Twitter or to a control arm (with no active tweeting from ESC channels) and aimed to assess whether Twitter promotion was associated with an increase in citation rates (primary endpoint) and of the Altmetric Score. This is the final analysis including 694 articles (one paper excluded due to retraction). After a median follow-up of 994 days (interquartile range: 936–1063 days), Twitter promotion of articles was associated with a 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.08–1.15) higher rate of citations, and this effect was independent of the type of article. Altmetric Attention Score and number of users tweeting were positive predictors for the number of citations. A social media strategy of Twitter promotion for cardiovascular medicine papers seems to be associated with increased online visibility and higher numbers of citations.",1

Introduction
Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line antimalarial drugs used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum alaria in many endemic countries worldwide. The present work reviewed the therapeutic efficacy of ACT in Cameroon more than 10 years after the initial change in national drug policy in 2004.

Methods
A PubMed literature search was performed to analyse clinical trials conducted in Cameroon from 2001 to May 2017. Clinical studies that evaluated ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children or adults, and reported efficacy and/or safety, were included. In addition, a small network meta-analysis (NMA) with a frequentist approach was performed.

Results
Six papers were selected from 48 articles screened and were full-text reviewed. The efficacy of both artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) ranged from moderate to high, with polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates ranging from 96.7 to 100% and 88.2 to 100%, respectively, in per-protocol analysis, and 86.2 to 96.7% and 74.0 to 90.6%, respectively, in intention-to-treat analysis. The malaria evidence network suggested that AL and ASAQ efficacies were comparable. The highest day 3 parasite positivity rate was 8.2% for ASAQ and 4% for AL. A novel ACT, artesunate-atovaquoneproguanil (ASATPG) was tested once and showed a cure rate of 100%. Based on an ITT approach, the NMA revealed that AL was more efficacious than ASAQ, but the difference was not statistical significant (706 participants, three randomised clinical trials (RCT); OR 1.25, 95%CI 0.78–2.00). Adverse events ranged from mild to moderate severity but were not directly attributed to drug intake.

Conclusion
ACTs are still effective and safe in Cameroon; however, there are insufficient data on their efficacy, safety and tolerability, therefore more RCTs should be conducted, including novel ACTs.

Aims
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). For both, CKD and CAD, the intercellular transfer of microRNAs (miRs) through extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an important factor of disease development. Whether the combination of CAD and CKD affects endothelial function through cellular crosstalk of EV-incorporated miRs is still unknown.

Methods and results
Out of 172 screened CAD patients, 31 patients with CAD + CKD were identified and matched with 31 CAD patients without CKD. Additionally, 13 controls without CAD and CKD were included. Large EVs from CAD + CKD patients contained significantly lower levels of the vasculo-protective miR-130a-3p and miR-126-3p compared to CAD patients and controls. Flow cytometric analysis of plasma-derived EVs revealed significantly higher numbers of endothelial cell-derived EVs in CAD and CAD + CKD patients compared to controls. EVs from CAD + CKD patients impaired target human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) proliferation upon incubation in vitro. Consistent with the clinical data, treatment with the uraemia toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS)-reduced miR-130a-3p levels in HCAEC-derived EVs. EVs from IS-treated donor HCAECs-reduced proliferation and re-endothelialization in EV-recipient cells and induced an anti-angiogenic gene expression profile. In a mouse-experiment, intravenous treatment with EVs from IS-treated endothelial cells significantly impaired endothelial regeneration. On the molecular level, we found that IS leads to an up-regulation of the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU), which retains miR-130a-3p in the cell leading to reduced vesicular miR-130a-3p export and impaired EV-recipient cell proliferation.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest that EV-miR-mediated vascular intercellular communication is altered in patients with CAD and CKD, promoting CKD-induced endothelial dysfunction.",1

This study aims to explore the conscious fantasies about the unborn baby among women experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum and identify possible clinical implications. Fourteen inpatient
women with moderate to severe symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum and between the 12
and 14 weeks gestation participated in semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the transcripts
revealed escape and aggression fantasies about the baby, denial of fantasies in the categories
tested (name, sex, external and internal characteristics of the baby), freezing of the maternalfetus bond, and ambivalence toward the continuation of the pregnancy. Neither the severity of
symptoms nor the stated quality of life mediated the results. These findings suggest that the
discussion and reframing of fantasies can be proven helpful and relieving for the women facing
any pregnancy complication. Toward achieving a multidisciplinary approach, the variable of fantasy should be considered among others.",1
"Abstract: Introduction: The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of orthodontic miniscrew implants—temporary intraoral skeletal anchorage devices (TISADs)—in anchorage reinforcement during enmasse retraction in relation to conventional methods of anchorage. Methods: A search of PubMed, Embase,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science was performed. The keywords were orthodontic, mini-implants, miniscrews, miniplates, and temporary anchorage device. Relevant articles were
assessed for quality according to Cochrane guidelines and the data extracted for statistical analysis. A metaanalysis of raw mean differences concerning anchorage loss, tipping of molars, retraction of incisors, tipping
of incisors, and treatment duration was carried out. Results: Initially, we retrieved 10,038 articles. The selection
process finally resulted in 14 articles including 616 patients (451 female, 165 male) for detailed analysis. Quality
of the included studies was assessed as moderate. Meta-analysis showed that use of TISADs facilitates better
anchorage reinforcement compared with conventional methods. On average, TISADs enabled 1.86 mm more
anchorage preservation than did conventional methods (P \0.001). Conclusions: The results of the metaanalysis showed that TISADs are more effective than conventional methods of anchorage reinforcement. The
average difference of 2 mm seems not only statistically but also clinically significant. However, the results
should be interpreted with caution because of the moderate quality of the included studies. More high-quality
studies on this issue are necessary to enable drawing more reliable conclusions. (Am J Orthod Dentofacial

"Abstract
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been implicated in cancer progression through largely unknown mechanisms. Herein, we identify an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified circRNA, circNSUN2, frequently upregulated in tumor tissues and serum samples from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients with liver metastasis (LM) and predicts poorer patient survival. The upregulated expression of circNSUN2 promotes LM in PDX metastasis models in vivo and accelerates cancer cells invasion in vitro. Importantly, N6-methyladenosine modification of circNSUN2 increases export to the cytoplasm. By forming a circNSUN2/IGF2BP2/HMGA2 RNA-protein ternary complex in the cytoplasm, circNSUN2 enhances the stability of HMGA2 mRNA to promote CRC metastasis progression. Clinically, the upregulated expressions of circNSUN2 and HMGA2 are more prevalent in LM tissues than in primary CRC tissues. These findings elucidate that N6-methyladenosine modification of circNSUN2 modulates cytoplasmic export and stabilizes HMGA2 to promote CRC LM, and suggest that circNSUN2 could represent a critical prognostic marker and/or therapeutic target for the disease.",1
"Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease with worldwide prevalence that is associated with a decrease in the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The aim of the present study was to explore the potential hub genes of EPCs in patients with type 2 DM. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from a public microarray dataset (accession no. GSE43950). Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized. The most significantly clustered modules and hub genes were identified using Cytoscape. Furthermore, hub genes were validated by quantitative PCR analysis of EPCs isolated from diabetic and normal subjects. Subsequently, weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify the modules incorporating the genes exhibiting the most significant variance. A total of 970 DEGs were obtained and they were mainly accumulated in inflammation‑associated pathways. A total of 9 hub genes were extracted from the PPI network and the highest differential expression was determined for the interleukin 8 (IL8) and CXC chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) genes. In the WGCNA performed to determine the modules associated with type 2 DM, one module incorporated IL8 and CXCL1. Finally, pathway enrichment of 10% genes in the pink module ordered by intramodular connectivity (IC) was associated with the IL17 and the chemokine signaling pathways. The present results revealed that the expression of IL8 and CXCL1 may serve important roles in the pathophysiology of EPCs during type 2 DM and inflammatory response may be critical for the reduced number and hypofunction of EPCs isolated from patients with diabetes.",1

Background
Soluble human leucocyte antigen (sHLA) molecules, released into the plasma, carry their original peptide cargo and provide insight into the protein synthesis and degradation schemes of their source cells and tissues. Other body fluids, such as pleural effusions, may also contain sHLA-peptide complexes, and can potentially serve as a source of tumor antigens since these fluids are drained from the tumor microenvironment. We explored this possibility by developing a methodology for purifying and analyzing large pleural effusion sHLA class I peptidomes of patients with malignancies or benign diseases.

Methods
Cleared pleural fluids, cell pellets present in the pleural effusions, and the primary tumor cells cultured from cancer patients’ effusions, were used for immunoaffinity purification of the HLA molecules. The recovered HLA peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the resulting LC-MS/MS data were analyzed with the MaxQuant software tool. Selected tumor antigen peptides were tested for their immunogenicity potential with donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in an in vitro assay.

Results
Mass spectrometry analysis of the pleural effusions revealed 39,669 peptides attributable to 11,305 source proteins. The majority of peptides identified from the pleural effusions were defined as HLA ligands that fit the patients’ HLA consensus sequence motifs. The membranal and soluble HLA peptidomes of each individual patient correlated to each other. Additionally, soluble HLA peptidomes from the same patient, obtained at different visits to the clinic, were highly similar. Compared with benign effusions, the soluble HLA peptidomes of malignant pleural effusions were larger and included HLA peptides derived from known tumor-associated antigens, including cancer/testis antigens, lung-related proteins, and vascular endothelial growth factor pathway proteins. Selected tumor-associated antigens that were identified by the immunopeptidomics were able to successfully prime CD8+ T cells.

Conclusions
Pleural effusions contain sHLA-peptide complexes, and the pleural effusion HLA peptidome of patients with malignant tumors can serve as a rich source of biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and potential candidates for personalized immunotherapy.

"ABSTRACT
Estimation of the plasma membrane potential (PMP) in yeast by the
fluorescence changes of various indicators have been studied by several
groups for many years; with most variable results. The most used of these indicators have been DiSC3(3) and DiSC3(5). This contribution explores
different dyes studied, methods and incubation media, as well as the
different parameters analyzed. Particularly with DiSC3(3), from rather high
to very low values of PMP have been calculated. Recently, we reported
that fluorescence changes and accumulation of acridine yellow can be used
to estimate and obtain actual values of the PMP in yeast. The experiments
were performed with an old dye from a flask labeled “acridine yellow”
from a commercial source. However, NMR and mass spectrometry
revealed that it was thioflavin T. With the pure dye, the experiments were
repeated. Also the accumulation of the dye was measured to obtain real
values of PMP, mainly based in permeabilizing the cells with chitosan in
the absence or presence of an adequate concentration of KCl that allowed
to correct the raw data obtained. Hence, more accurate values were
obtained. Moreover, results of comparing this dye with others used so far,
point to thioflavin T as the best one to follow by fluorescence and measure
by its accumulation the plasma membrane potential in yeast.

"Abstract
Bax is a pro-apoptotic cytosolic protein. In this work native (unphosphorylated) and JNK3 phosphorylated Bax proteins are studied on artificial bilayer membranes for pore formation. Phosphorylated Bax formed pore on the bilayer lipid membrane whereas native one does not. In cells undergoing apoptosis the pore formed by the phosphorylated Bax could be important in cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. The low conductance (1.5 nS) of the open state of the phosphorylated Bax pore corresponds to pore diameter of 0.9 nm which is small to release cytochrome c (∼3.4 nm). We hypothesized that JNK3 phosphorylated Bax protein can form bigger pores after forming complexes with other mitochondrial proteins like VDAC, t-Bid etc. to release cytochrome c.",1
"Abstract: Objective: This study investigates the effects of the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (KOA) with
autologous platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection on pain, pain mediators and inflammatory factors. Methods:
A total of 86 patients with advanced KOA who received treatment in our hospital were divided into the observation
group and the control group based on their sequence of receiving treatment (n=43 in each). The patients in the
observation group were treated with autologous platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection, while the patients in
the control group were treated with the intra-articular injection of a mixture of lidocaine and compound betamethasone. The changes of VAS score, knee joint swelling score, knee joint function score and serum inflammatory factors
before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. Results: The observation group had an effective rate of 86.05% for pain relief of advanced KOA, which is significantly higher than 62.79% in the control group
(P<0.05). After treatment, the swollen knee joint scores of the two groups were significantly decreased, the knee
function score was significantly increased, and the change of the observation group was greater than that of the
control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the expression levels of pain mediators, leukotrienes and inflammatory factors in both groups decreased significantly, and the observation group decreased much more than the control group
(P>0.05). Conclusion: The treatment of advanced KOA with autologous platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection
has good effects on the improvement of pain symptoms. It can effectively improve the degree and function of the
swollen knee joint of patients and reduce the levels of pain mediators and inflammatory factors, so it is worthy of
clinical promotion.

"Abstract
Introduction There has been a phenomenal
worldwide increase in the development and use
of mobile health applications (mHealth apps)
that monitor menstruation and fertility. Critics
argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and
lack evidence from either clinical trials or user
experience. The aim of this scoping review is to
provide an overview of the research literature
on mHealth apps that track menstruation and
fertility.
Methods This project followed the PRISMA
Extension for Scoping Reviews. The ACM,
CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus
databases were searched for material published
between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019.
Data summary and synthesis were used to chart
and analyse the data.
Results In total 654 records were reviewed.
Subsequently, 135 duplicate records and 501
records that did not meet the inclusion criteria
were removed. Eighteen records from 13
countries form the basis of this review. The
papers reviewed cover a variety of disciplinary
and methodological frameworks. Three main
themes were identified: fertility and reproductive
health tracking, pregnancy planning, and
pregnancy prevention.
Conclusions Motivations for fertility app use are
varied, overlap and change over time, although
women want apps that are accurate and
evidence-based regardless of whether they are
tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or
using the app as a form of contraception. There
is a lack of critical debate and engagement in the
development, evaluation, usage and regulation
of fertility and menstruation apps. The paucity of
evidence-based research and absence of fertility,
health professionals and users in studies is raised.",1
"Abstract
The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in children with ASD. Subjects were 32 children with ASD and 30 healthy children as controls. The numbers of mDCs and pDCs and the expression of CD86 and CD80 on the entire DCs were detected by flow cytometry. ASD children had significantly higher percentages of mDCs and pDCs when compared to controls. We found significant inverse relationships between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the frequencies of mDCs and pDCs in autistic children. Our data suggested that DCs could play a role in the clinical course of ASD. The relationship of DCs to immune disorders in ASD remains to be determined.",1

Background
In industrial yeasts, selection and breeding for resistance to multiple stresses is a focus of current research. The objective of this study was to investigate the tolerance to multiple stresses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained through an adaptive laboratory evolution strategy involving a repeated liquid nitrogen freeze–thaw process coupled with multi-stress shock selection. We also assessed the related resistance mechanisms and very high-gravity (VHG) bioethanol production of this strain.
Results
Elite S. cerevisiae strain YF10-5, exhibiting improved VHG fermentation capacity and stress resistance to osmotic pressure and ethanol, was isolated following ten consecutive rounds of liquid nitrogen freeze–thaw treatment followed by plate screening under osmotic and ethanol stress. The ethanol yield of YF10-5 was 16% higher than that of the parent strain during 35% (w/v) glucose fermentation. Furthermore, there was upregulation of three genes (HSP26, HSP30, and HSP104) encoding heat-shock proteins involved in the stress response, one gene (TPS1) involved in the synthesis of trehalose, and three genes (ADH1, HXK1, and PFK1) involved in ethanol metabolism and intracellular trehalose accumulation in YF10-5 yeast cells, indicating increased stress tolerance and fermentative capacity. YF10-5 also showed excellent fermentation performance during the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of VHG sweet potato mash, producing 13.40% (w/v) ethanol, which corresponded to 93.95% of the theoretical ethanol yield.
Conclusions
A multiple-stress-tolerant yeast clone was obtained using adaptive evolution by a freeze–thaw method coupled with stress shock selection. The selected robust yeast strain exhibits potential for bioethanol production through VHG fermentation.

"ABSTRACT
Introduction: Cannabis smoking can result in elevation of heart rate and blood pressure immediately
after use, possibly from sympathetic nervous system stimulation and parasympathetic nervous system
inhibition. Vascular inflammation, platelet activation, and carboxyhemoglobin generation have also
been proposed as potential side effects of cannabis smoking. As such, an association between cannabis use and acute coronary syndrome has been postulated.
Objective: The objective of our study was to analyze systematically the medical literature pertaining
to this putative association.
Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey were queried using a unique search string. All
human trials, case series, or case reports of cannabis use and acute coronary syndrome in any language were considered in the literature search. The definition of acute coronary syndrome represented
a penumbra that included chest pain, angina pectoris, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrest. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Our final search strategy included free-text words (TW):
(“cannabis”[TW] OR ""marijuana""[TW]) AND (""acute coronary syndrome""[TW] OR “myocardial” OR
“ischemia”[TW] OR “infarction”[TW] OR “chest pain”[TW] OR “cardiac arrest”[TW] OR “angina”[TW]). To
remain consistent over a span of five decades, we specifically did not include any publications with
non-phytogenic, non-smoked cannabis as the sole etiology, as these are relatively recent and may possess additional pharmacologic characteristics compared to phytogenic cannabinoids. Therefore, for the
purpose of this review, the term “cannabis” refers to the smoked phytogenic form. The search resulted
in 325 articles. References in each selected publication were carefully hand-searched for any additional
reports having relevance, and a total of 12 publications were identified in this manner. Following comparison and discussion amongst the co-authors, duplicate and non-relevant publications were
removed, and a total of 85 publications involving 541,518 human subjects were selected for inclusion.
Results were synthesized and reviewed by the authors for relevance. Clinical trials, observational studies, retrospective studies, case series, and case reports were graded using Oxford Centre for Evidencebased Medicine guidelines.
Results: There were no Level I randomized blinded controlled studies specifically addressing the cannabis/acute coronary syndrome association. However, there were five Level I systematic reviews, 14
Level II studies with 83,961 subjects, and 14 Level III studies with 457,495 subjects. Conclusions from
28 of these 33 studies highlighted an increased risk of both acute coronary syndrome and chronic cardiovascular disease from cannabis use. The systematic reviews were wide-ranging in topic and scale,
and none specifically focused on the association between cannabis use and acute coronary syndrome.
The dissenting studies included two systematic reviews, one concluding there was limited and weak
evidence for association of cardiovascular disease and acute coronary syndromes with cannabis use,
and another citing the evidence was inconclusive. The other dissenting articles were two longitudinal
prospective studies and a retrospective review concluding cannabis users had lower post-myocardial
infarction mortality. There were 51 case series (Level IV) and case reports (Level V) with 62 subjects.
Six cases were female (10%). Average age was 31 ± 12 years, reported maximum heart rate was 88 ±
21 bpm, systolic blood pressure was 125 ± 32 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure was 80 ± 17
mmHg. ST-segment elevation was documented on 37 (60%) electrocardiograms, and the most common angiographic finding was left anterior descending coronary arterial occlusion and/or stenosis in
22 (35%) patients. Concomitant cardiomyopathy was described in 21 (34%) cases. There were 14
(23%) deaths attributed to acute coronary syndrome associated with cannabis use.
Conclusion: There were five Level I systematic reviews, 14 Level II studies with 83,961 subjects, and
14 Level III studies with 457,495 subjects. All but five Level I–III publications highlighted an increased
risk of both acute coronary syndrome and chronic cardiovascular disease associated with cannabis use",1

The objective of the current study was to systematically review the evidence of the effect of secular
mindfulness techniques on function and structure of the brain. Based on areas known from traditional
meditation neuroimaging results, we aimed to explore a neuronal explanation of the stress-reducing
effects of the 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive
Therapy (MBCT) program.
Methods: We assessed the effect of MBSR and MBCT (N = 11, all MBSR), components of the programs
(N = 15), and dispositional mindfulness (N = 4) on brain function and/or structure as assessed by
(functional) magnetic resonance imaging. 21 fMRI studies and seven MRI studies were included (two
studies performed both).
Results: The prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the insula and the hippocampus showed increased
activity, connectivity and volume in stressed, anxious and healthy participants. Additionally, the
amygdala showed decreased functional activity, improved functional connectivity with the prefrontal
cortex, and earlier deactivation after exposure to emotional stimuli.
Conclusion: Demonstrable functional and structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex,
insula and hippocampus are similar to changes described in studies on traditional meditation practice.
In addition, MBSR led to changes in the amygdala consistent with improved emotion regulation. These
findings indicate that MBSR-induced emotional and behavioral changes are related to functional and
structural changes in the brain",1
"ABSTRACT
Recent research carried out in the Serranía La Lindosa (Department of Guaviare) provides archaeological evidence of the colonisation of the northwest Colombian Amazon during the Late Pleistocene. Preliminary excavations were conducted at Cerro Azul, Limoncillos and Cerro Montoya archaeological sites in Guaviare
Department, Colombia. Contemporary dates at the three separate rock shelters establish initial colonisation of
the region between ~12,600 and ~11,800 cal BP. The contexts also yielded thousands of remains of fauna, flora,
lithic artefacts and mineral pigments, associated with extensive and spectacular rock pictographs that adorn the
rock shelter walls. This article presents the first data from the region, dating the timing of colonisation, describing subsistence strategies, and examines human adaptation to these transitioning landscapes. The results
increase our understanding of the global expansion of human populations, enabling assessment of key interactions between people and the environment that appear to have lasting repercussions for one of the most
important and biologically diverse ecosystems in the world.",1

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of real-time MRI for dynamic
assessment of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with GERD (gastroesophageal
reflux disease)-like symptoms compared to pH-metry and impedance.
Methods: Patients who underwent real-time MRI and pH-metry between 2015-2018
were included in this retrospective study. Real-time MRI at 3 Tesla was achieved by
undersampled radial FLASH acquisitions with iterative image reconstruction by
NLINV. Real-time MRI visualized transit of pineapple juice through the
gastroesophageal junction and during Valsalva maneuver. MRI results were
compared to 24-hour pH-metry to assess acidic reflux (following Lyon Consensus
guidelines) and to impedance to assess non-acidic reflux. A standard 2x2 table was
chosen to calculate diagnostic performance.
Results: 91/93 eligible patients fulfilled inclusion criteria (male n = 49; female n = 42;
median age 55 y). All MRI studies were successfully completed without adverse
events at a mean examination time of 15 minutes. On real-time MRI, reflux was
evident in 60 patients (66%). pH-metry revealed reflux in 41 patients (45%), and
impedance in 54 patients (59%). Compared to pH-metry and impedance, real-time
MRI sensitivity was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.66-0.87), specificity 0.67 (95% CI: 0.45-0.84) and
PPV 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75-0.94).
Conclusion: Real-time MRI is an imaging method for assessment of
gastroesophageal reflux in patients with GERD-like symptoms. Considering its high
positive predictive value, real-time MRI can accurately identify patients in which
further invasive testing with pH-metry and impedance might be considered",1

Background: The burden of surgical infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains poorly
defined compared with high-income countries. Although there are common infections necessitating surgery
prevalent across the world, such as appendicitis and peptic ulcer disease, other conditions are more localized
geographically. To date, comprehensive assessment of the burden of surgically treatable infections or sequelae
of surgical infections in LMICs is lacking.
Methods: We reviewed the literature to define the burden of surgical infections in LMICs and characterize the
needs and challenges of addressing this issue.
Results: Surgical infections comprise a broad range of diseases including intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue,
and healthcare-associated infections and other infectious processes. Treatment of surgical infections requires a
functional surgical ecosystem, microbiology services, and appropriate and effective antimicrobial therapy.
Systems must be developed and maintained to evaluate screening, prevention, and treatment strategies. Solutions and interventions are proposed focusing on reducing the burden of disease, improving surveillance,
strengthening antibiotic stewardship, and enhancing the management of surgical infections.
Conclusions: Surgical infections constitute a large burden of disease globally. Challenges to management in
LMICs include a shortage of trained personnel and material resources. The increasing rate of antimicrobial drug
resistance, likely related to antibiotic misuse, adds to the challenges. Development of surveillance, infection
prevention, and antimicrobial stewardship programs are initial steps forward. Education is critical and should
begin early in training, be an active process, and be sustained through regular programs.

"In animal models, time-restricted feeding (TRF) can prevent and reverse aspects of metabolic diseases. Time-restricted eating (TRE) in human pilot studies reduces the risks of metabolic diseases in otherwise healthy individuals. However, patients with diagnosed metabolic syndrome often undergo pharmacotherapy, and it has never been tested whether TRE can act synergistically with pharmacotherapy in animal models or humans. In a single-arm, paired-sample trial, 19 participants with metabolic syndrome and a baseline mean daily eating window of ≥14 h, the majority of whom were on a statin and/or antihypertensive therapy, underwent 10 h of TRE (all dietary intake within a consistent self-selected 10 h window) for 12 weeks. We found this TRE intervention improves cardiometabolic health for patients with metabolic syndrome receiving standard medical care including high rates of statin and anti-hypertensive use. TRE is a potentially powerful lifestyle intervention that can be added to standard medical practice to treat metabolic syndrome.",1
"Abstract
The dopamine D3 receptor is a prime target for developing treatments for cocaine use disorders (CUDs). In this study, we conducted a pre-clinical investigation of the therapeutic potential of a long-acting, D3 receptor partial agonist, MC-25-41. Male rats were pre-treated with MC-25-41 (vehicle, 1.0, 3.0, 5.6, or 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP)) five minutes prior to tests of cocaine or sucrose intake on either a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement or a variable interval 60 s multiple schedule consisting of 4, 15-min components with sucrose or cocaine available in alternating components. A separate cohort of rats was tested on a within-session, dose-reduction procedure to determine the effects of MC-25-41 on demand for cocaine using a behavioral economics analysis. Finally, rats were tested for effects of MC-25-41 on spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion. MC-25-41 failed to alter locomotion, but reduced reinforcement rates for both cocaine and sucrose on the low-effort, multiple schedule. However, on the higher-effort, progressive ratio schedule of cocaine reinforcement, MC-25-41 reduced infusions, and active lever presses at doses that did not alter sucrose intake. The behavioral economics analysis showed that MC-25-41 also increased cocaine demand elasticity compared to vehicle, indicating a reduction in consumption as price increases. Together, these results suggest that similar to other D3-selective antagonists and partial agonists, MC-25-41 reduces motivation for cocaine under conditions of high cost but has the added advantage of a long half-life (>10 h). These findings suggest that MC-25-41 may be a suitable pre-clinical lead compound for development of medications to treat CUDs.

Objectives Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs) appear
before disease onset and are associated with bone
destruction. We aimed to dissect the role of ACPAs in
osteoclast (OC) activation and to identify key cellular
mediators in this process.
Methods Polyclonal ACPA were isolated from the
synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood of patients with
RA. Monoclonal ACPAs were isolated from single SF
B-cells of patients with RA. OCs were developed from
blood cell precursors with or without ACPAs. We
analysed expression of citrullinated targets and
peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD) enzymes by
immunohistochemistry and cell supernatants by
cytometric bead array. The effect of an anti-interleukin
(IL)-8 neutralising antibody and a pan-PAD inhibitor was
tested in the OC cultures. Monoclonal ACPAs were
injected into mice and bone structure was analysed by
micro-CT before and after CXCR1/2 blocking with
reparixin.
Results Protein citrullination by PADs is essential for
OC differentiation. Polyclonal ACPAs enhance OC
differentiation through a PAD-dependent IL-8-mediated
autocrine loop that is completely abolished by IL-8
neutralisation. Some, but not all, human monoclonal
ACPAs derived from single SF B-cells of patients with RA
and exhibiting distinct epitope specificities promote OC
differentiation in cell cultures. Transfer of the monoclonal
ACPAs into mice induced bone loss that was completely
reversed by the IL-8 antagonist reparixin.
Conclusions We provide novel insights into the key
role of citrullination and PAD enzymes during OC
differentiation and ACPA-induced OC activation. Our
findings suggest that IL8-dependent OC activation may
constitute an early event in the initiation of the joint
specific inflammation in ACPA-positive RA.",1
"Abstract
More and more these days, airport security is having to adapt to a greater number of passengers while keeping within finer margins of precision when it comes to clearing passengers for security clearance. Therefore, analyzing potential upgrades in the security process and adopting them in a way that does not impact passenger experience has become a key activity for airport managers. One viable technological solution that is not only effective but also efficient is biometric security. This technology allows for passengers to safely clear security based on their unique biometric features. Despite its promise, airports and passengers alike are slow to adopt its use. Additionally, there were few studies that revealed insights into passengers’ intentions toward repeat use of biometric security. Hence, in our novel attempts to uncover the underlying reasons, we implemented a study on passengers’ initial and repeat usage intention based on perceived benefits and risks of biometric security technology. Based on 327 survey responses, we employed the use of SEM to extract first- and second-order constructs before evaluating our hypotheses on a finally accepted model. To be aligned with the novel attempt of this research, the results showed that both the perceived benefits and risks have a significant impact on passenger’s initial and repeat use intention of biometric security. Therefore, for all practitioners engaged in sustainable airport management, strong consideration from this research should help in creating value for passengers while mitigating the risks of adopting biometric security within airport security settings.

"Introduction: Obesity treatment is less successful for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, particularly when delivered in primary care. Digital health strategies can extend the reach of
clinical obesity treatments to care settings serving patients at highest risk.
Methods: Track was an effectiveness RCT of a 12-month digital weight-loss intervention, embedded
within a community health center system. Participants were 351 adult patients (aged 21−65 years)
with obesity and hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Patients were randomized to usual care
(n = 175) or an intervention (n = 176) comprising app-based self-monitoring of behavior change goals
with tailored feedback, a smart scale, dietitian-delivered counseling calls, and clinician counseling
informed by app-generated recommendations, delivered via electronic health record. The primary
outcome was 12-month weight change. Randomization began on June 18, 2013, final assessments
were completed on September 10, 2015. Data analysis was conducted in 2016 and 2017. The trial
retained 92% of usual care and 96% of intervention participants at 12 months.
Results: The Track intervention produced larger weight losses relative to usual care at 6 months
(net effect: −4.4 kg, 95% CI = −5.5, −3.3, p < 0.001) and 12 months (net effect: −3.8 kg, 95%
CI = −5.0, −2.5, p < 0.001). Intervention participants were more likely to lose ≥5% of their baseline weight at 6 months (43% vs 6%, p < 0.001) and 12 months (40% vs 17%, p < 0.001). Intervention participants completing ≥ 80% of expected self-monitoring episodes (−3.5 kg); counseling
calls (−3.0 kg); or self-weighing days (−4.4 kg) lost significantly more weight than less engaged
intervention participants (all p < 0.01).
Conclusions: A digital obesity treatment, integrated with health system resources, can produce
clinically meaningful weight-loss outcomes among socioeconomically disadvantaged primary care
patients with elevated cardiovascular disease risk.

Background
Improving resistance to mastitis, one of the costliest diseases in dairy production, has become an important objective in dairy cattle breeding. However, mastitis resistance is influenced by many genes involved in multiple processes, including the response to infection, inflammation, and post-infection healing. Low genetic heritability, environmental variations, and farm management differences further complicate the identification of links between genetic variants and mastitis resistance. Consequently, studies of the genetics of variation in mastitis resistance in dairy cattle lack agreement about the responsible genes.

Results
We associated 15,552,968 imputed whole-genome sequencing markers for 5147 Nordic Holstein cattle with mastitis resistance in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Next, we augmented P-values for markers in genes in the associated regions using Gene Ontology terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and mammalian phenotype database. To confirm results of gene-based analyses, we used gene expression data from E. coli-challenged cow udders. We identified 22 independent quantitative trait loci (QTL) that collectively explained 14% of the variance in breeding values for resistance to clinical mastitis (CM). Using association test statistics with multiple pieces of independent information on gene function and differential expression during bacterial infection, we suggested putative causal genes with biological relevance for 12 QTL affecting resistance to CM in dairy cattle.

Conclusion
Combining information on the nearest positional genes, gene-based analyses, and differential gene expression data from RNA-seq, we identified putative causal genes (candidate genes with biological evidence) in QTL for mastitis resistance in Nordic Holstein cattle. The same strategy can be applied for other traits.",1

Although emerging evidence suggests that low levels of vitamin D may contribute to the development of autoimmune disease, the relationship between vitamin D reduction and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), which includes Graves’ disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), is still controversial. The aim was to evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and AITD through systematic literature review. We identified all studies that assessed the association between vitamin D and AITD from PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. We included studies that compared vitamin D levels between AITD cases and controls as well as those that measured the odds of vitamin D deficiency by AITD status. We combined the standardized mean differences (SMD) or the odds ratios (OR) in a random effects model. Twenty case-control studies provided data for a quantitative meta-analysis. Compared to controls, AITD patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D (SMD: −0.99, 95% CI: −1.31, −0.66) and were more likely to be deficient in 25(OH)D (OR 2.99, 95% CI: 1.88, 4.74). Furthermore, subgroup analyses result showed that GD and HT patients also had lower 25(OH)D levels and were more likely to have a 25(OH)D deficiency, suggesting that low levels of serum 25(OH)D was related to AITD.

"Recently, we reported that angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan, and calcium
channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine, had similar effects on the prevention of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) events in diabetic hypertensive patients. We assessed the difference of
cardiovascular protective effects between ARB and CCB in patients with and without
previous CVD, respectively. A total of 1,150 Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients were
randomized to either valsartan or amlodipine treatment arms, which were additionally
divided into 2 groups according to the presence of previous CVD at baseline (without CVD,
n [ 818; with CVD, n [ 332). The primary composite outcomes were sudden cardiac
death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization
for heart failure. The incidence of primary end point events in patients with previous CVD
was 3.5-times greater than that in patients without previous CVD (64.1 vs 17.9/1,000
person-years). The ARB- and the CCB-based treatment arms showed similar incidence of
composite CVD events in both patients without previous CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 2.40) and those with previous CVD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48
to 1.31). The ARB-treatment arm showed less incidence of stroke compared with the
CCB-based treatment arm in patients with previous CVD (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.11,
p [ 0.068), whereas the 2 treatment arms showed similar incidence of stroke in patients
without previous CVD (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.91). In conclusion, the ARB- and the
CCB-based treatments exerted similar protective effects of CVD events regardless of the
presence of previous CVD. For stroke events, the ARB may have more protective effects
than the CCB in diabetic hypertensive patients with previous CVD. _x0001_ 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: To understand key characteristics of mothers who were early adopters of MyPlate (the iconic
representation of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans) in order to speed adoption among others.
Methods: Through a national online survey, 497 mothers answered questions about MyPlate, demographics, attitudes, and behaviors. Spearman’s rho correlation analysis was conducted between MyPlate
familiarity and usage and these attitudinal and behavioral predictor variables.
Results: MyPlate familiarity was highest among those who found it easy to understand (P ¼ .001) and
who were also familiar with MyPyramid (P < .001). Vegetable lovers most strongly believed that MyPlate

to nutrition knowledge and cooking experience. Efforts to expand MyPlate to new user groups should
explain its purpose and applications, build on familiarity with MyPyramid, and offer practical guidance
for preparing vegetables.

"Summary
Background
Symptomatic breakthrough in proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-treated gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients is a common problem with a range of underlying causes. The nonsystemic, raft-forming action of alginates may help resolve symptoms.

Aim
To assess alginate-antacid (Gaviscon Double Action, RB, Slough, UK) as add-on therapy to once-daily PPI for suppression of breakthrough reflux symptoms.

Methods
In two randomised, double-blind studies (exploratory, n=52; confirmatory, n=262), patients taking standard-dose PPI who had breakthrough symptoms, assessed by Heartburn Reflux Dyspepsia Questionnaire (HRDQ), were randomised to add-on Gaviscon or placebo (20 mL after meals and bedtime). The exploratory study endpoint was change in HRDQ score during treatment vs run-in. The confirmatory study endpoint was “response” defined as ≥3 days reduction in the number of “bad” days (HRDQ [heartburn/regurgitation] >0.70) during treatment vs run-in.

Results
In the exploratory study, significantly greater reductions in HRDQ scores (heartburn/regurgitation) were observed in the Gaviscon vs placebo (least squares mean difference [95% CI] −2.10 [−3.71 to −0.48]; P=.012). Post hoc “responder” analysis of the exploratory study also revealed significantly more Gaviscon patients (75%) achieved ≥3 days reduction in “bad” days vs placebo patients (36%), P=.005. In the confirmatory study, symptomatic improvement was observed with add-on Gaviscon (51%) but there was no significant difference in response vs placebo (48%) (OR (95% CI) 1.15 (0.69-1.91), P=.5939).

Conclusions
Adding Gaviscon to PPI reduced breakthrough GERD symptoms but a nearly equal response was observed for placebo. Response to intervention may vary according to whether symptoms are functional in origin.",1
"ABSTRACT
Background: As one strategy to improve the health and survival of people who inject drugs, the King County
Heroin & Opioid Addiction Task Force recommended the establishment of supervised injection facilities (SIF)
where people can inject drugs in a safe and hygienic environment with clinical supervision. Analyses for other
sites have found them to be cost-effective, but it is not clear whether these findings are transferable to other
settings.
Methods: We utilized local estimates and other data sources deemed appropriate for our setting to implement a
mathematical model that assesses the impact of a hypothetical SIF on overdose deaths, non-fatal overdose health
service utilization, skin and soft tissue infections, bacterial infections, viral infections, and enrollment in medication assisted treatment (MAT). We estimated the costs and savings that would occur on an annual basis for a
small-scale pilot site given current overdose rates, as well as three other scenarios of varying scale and underlying overdose rates.
Results: Assuming current overdose rates, a hypothetical Seattle SIF in a pilot phase is projected to annually
reverse 167 overdoses and prevent 6 overdose deaths, 45 hospitalizations, 90 emergency department visits, and
92 emergency medical service deployments. Additionally, the site would facilitate the enrollment of 41 SIF
clients in medication assisted treatment programs. These health benefits correspond to a monetary value of
$5,156,019. The annual estimated cost of running the SIF is $1,222,332. The corresponding cost-benefit ratio
suggests that the pilot SIF would generate $4.22 for every dollar spent on SIF operational costs. The pilot SIF is
projected to save the healthcare system $534,453. If Seattle experienced elevated overdose rates and Seattle SIF
program were scaled up, the health benefits and financial value would be considerably greater.
Conclusion: This analysis suggests that a SIF program in Seattle would save lives and result in considerable
health benefits and cost savings.",1
"Abstract
Resveratrol has many beneficial biological actions, including cardiovascular protection
and antithrombotic effects. Whether resveratrol inhibits oxidized low-density lipoprotein
(ox-LDL)-induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in activated platelets remains
unclear. The present study investigated the effects of resveratrol on the TLR4-mediated
inflammatory response in ox-LDL-activated platelets. The results showed that resveratrol
suppressed TLR4 expression in ox-LDL- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated platelets.

1 These authors contributed equally to this work.
2
Similar effects were found in puromycin-pretreated platelets. This suggests that TLR4
expression might be related to protein synthesis in ox-LDL- and LPS-activated platelets.
Further analysis confirmed that resveratrol attenuated the ox-LDL-induced phosphorylation
of nuclear factor B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).
A mechanistic analysis indicated that the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on TLR4 expression
was associated with the suppression of Akt phosphorylation. The combination of resveratrol
and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had a synergistic effect on the inhibition of Akt
phosphorylation and TLR4 expression. Moreover, resveratrol recovered sirtuin 1 expression
and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, which was reduced
by ox-LDL treatment. Furthermore, the platelet function analysis showed that resveratrol
(100 μM) reduced platelet aggregation and adhesion and CD40 ligand/platelet factor 4
secretion in ox-LDL-treated platelets. Altogether, the present findings show that resveratrol
inhibits the TLR4-mediated inflammatory response in ox-LDL-activated platelets, which may
contribute to the treatment of thrombosis and atherosclerosis.",1
"Abstract
Peptic ulcers are characterized by erosions on the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract that may reach the muscle layer. Their etiology is multifactorial and occurs when the balance between offensive and protective factors of the mucosa is disturbed. Peptic ulcers represent a global health problem, affecting millions of people worldwide and showing high rates of recurrence. Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most important predisposing factors for the development of peptic ulcers. Therefore, new approaches to complementary treatments are needed to prevent the development of ulcers and their recurrence. Natural products such as medicinal plants and their isolated compounds have been widely used in experimental models of peptic ulcers. Flavonoids are among the molecules of greatest interest in biological assays due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study is a literature review of flavonoids that have been reported to show peptic ulcer activity in experimental models. Studies published from January 2010 to January 2020 were selected from reference databases. This review refers to a collection of flavonoids with antiulcer activity in vivo and in vitro models.

Objective
To assess the efficacy and safety of postoperative intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods
From March 2020 to August 2020, all patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA in our hospital were considered in prospective randomized controlled study. Included patients were randomized into three groups to receive either two doses of 15 mg/kg intravenous TXA postoperatively, at 2 and 24 h after closing the incision (group A), or a single dose of 15 mg/kg intravenous TXA 2 h postoperatively (group B), or placebo (group C). The calculated total blood loss (TBL) and hidden blood loss (HBL), incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and transfusion rate were compared among groups. The levels of prothrombotic state parameters including thrombomodulin (TM), thrombin-anti-thrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-anti-plasmin complex (PIC), and tissue-type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor complex (t-PAI·C) in plasma were measured during the perioperative period. Patients were compared depending on the Kellgren-Lawrence classification (K-L types III and IV).

Results
All patients were followed up for at least 4 weeks. The mean TBL and HBL in group C (1,182.45 ± 160.50; and 965.47 ± 139.61 mL, respectively) were significantly higher than those in groups A (944.34 ± 130.88 mL, P < 0.05; and 712.45 ± 129.82mL, P < 0.05, respectively) or B (995.20 ± 154.00 mL, P < 0.05; and 757.20 ± 134.39 mL, P < 0.05, respectively), but no significant differences were found between groups A and B (P > 0.05 and P > 0.05, respectively). None of the patients of three groups received blood transfusion, so there were no significant differences in blood transfusion rate among groups. Similar results were obtained with subgroups of patients who had the K-L types III and IV. The DVT frequencies were four, three, and three in groups A, B, and C, respectively, with no significant differences after comparison (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the levels of prothrombotic state parameters (TM, TAT, PIC, t-PAI·C) or incidence of VTE among groups (P > 0.05). Wound leakage was observed in five patients during the hospital stay (two patients in group A, one patient in group B, and two patients in group C), and no statistical difference was found in wound leakage or other complications among groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusions
Short-term application of postoperative intravenous TXA in TKAs resulted in reduced HBL without a measured increase in the actual incidence of VTE or the potential risk of thrombosis, but administration of TXA after the first 24 h had no significant effect.",1

Introduction
Over the last decades, induction of labor has increased in many countries along with increasing maternal age. We assessed the effects of maternal age and labor induction on cesarean section at term among nulliparous and multiparous women without previous cesarean section.

Material and methods
We performed a retrospective national registry-based study from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden including 3 398 586 deliveries between 2000 and 2011. We investigated the impact of age on cesarean section among 196 220 nulliparous and 188 158 multiparous women whose labor was induced, had single cephalic presentation at term, and no previous cesarean section. Confounders comprised country, time-period, and gestational age.

Results
In nulliparous women with induced labor the rate of cesarean section increased from 14.0% in women less than 20 years of age to 39.9% in women 40 years and older. Compared with women aged 25-29 years, the corresponding relative risks were 0.60 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.57 to 0.64) and 1.72 (95% CI 1.66 to 1.79). In multiparous induced women the risk of cesarean section was 3.9% in women less than 20 years rising to 9.1% in women 40 years and older. Compared with women aged 25-29 years, the relative risks were 0.86 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.37) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.84 to 2.12), respectively. There were minimal confounding effects of country, time-period, and gestational age on risk for cesarean section.

Conclusions
Advanced maternal age is associated with increased risk of cesarean section in women undergoing labor induction with a single cephalic presentation at term without a previous cesarean section. The absolute risk of cesarean section is 3-5 times higher across 5-year age groups in nulliparous relative to multiparous women having induced labor.",1
"Abstract
Background: 
To explore the feasibility and safety of coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) via the distal radial artery in the anatomical snuffbox.

Methods: 
Ninety two patients who underwent CAG or PCI through distal radial artery access at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University from September 2017 to March 2018 were included in our study. We collected baseline characteristics, number, and duration of arterial punctures, procedural success rate, postoperative compression time, the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores at 3 hours after procedure, complications, hospitalization duration.

Results: 
The mean age was 69 ± 11years (44–92 years), and there were 57 males (62.0%). The diameter of the right distal radial artery and the more proximal right radial artery were 0.171 ± 0.05 cm, 0.213 ± 0.06 cm, respectively. On average, the number of puncture attempts was 1.52 ± 0.81, access time was 2.3 ± 1.78 minutes (0.33 – 8.72 minutes), access success was 95.7%, the postoperative compression time was 3.41 ± 0.76 hours (2–6 hours), the NRS scores at 3 hours was 1.53 ± 0.72 (1–4), and the mean hospitalization duration was 7.13 ± 4.02 days. Four patients underwent left distal radial artery access and 88 patients underwent right distal radial artery access. There were 3 local hematomas after procedure and 2 patients had vasospasm. There were no cases of major bleeding, arteriovenous fistula, radial artery occlusion, or hand numbness.

Conclusion: 
Cardiac catheterization through the distal radial artery in the snuffbox is safe and feasible. The right distal radial artery access can be routinely carried out.",1

Aims and objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a comprehensive protocol for constipation prevention.

Background
Constipation is a common problem for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), yet sparse evidence is available to guide constipation prevention after THA.

Design
Randomised controlled superiority clinical trial.

Methods
This randomised controlled study was carried out according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). A total of 80 THA patients were randomised to receive only preoperative education about lifestyle or the combination of education with postoperative abdominal massage and polyethylene glycol 4,000 (Forlax®). Efficacy outcomes included rates of postoperative constipation and enema rescue, as well as time to first postoperative defecation and readmission within 30 days. Safety outcomes were number and type of adverse events.

Results
Patients who received combination treatment showed a significantly lower rate of postoperative constipation during hospitalisation than patients who received only preoperative education (25% versus 55%), and they showed a significantly lower rate of enema rescue (12.5% versus 40%). Many more patients receiving combination treatment experienced their first defecation within two postoperative days than patients who received only preoperative education (62.5% versus 35.9%). In contrast, the two groups were similar in terms of constipation rate on postoperative days 15 and 30, rate of readmission within 30 days and rate of postoperative adverse events.

Conclusions
These results suggest that our comprehensive protocol can relieve constipation after THA, reduce the need for enema rescue and shorten time to first defecation without sacrificing safety. More work is needed to optimise and develop this protocol further.

"Cellular adaptation to excess iron (Fe) is a major determinant to protect tissues from toxicity. The
adaptation of hepatoma cell lines following exposure to toxic levels of Fe compounds was studied.
A dose- and time-dependent induction of toxicity was observed that was strictly compound-specific.
Similar ranging orders of toxicity, i.e. iron chloride 4iron sulfate 4iron citrate, were observed in four
human hepatoma cell lines. Long-term cultivation of HepG2 cells in 10 mM iron citrate resulted in a
resistant cell line that displayed high proliferation rates for several months. Resistant cells showed
increased viability at iron citrate concentrations ranging from 5–15 mM, while exposition to iron chloride
or iron sulfate induced high rates of toxicity similar to parental cells. Resistance was not due to
decreased Fe uptake/storage since high intracellular Fe levels were observed. A broad range of
modulated gene expression was associated with short- and long-term iron citrate exposition; however,
after weaning of resistant cells, re-exposition to Fe induced a similar level of toxicity as observed in
parental cells suggesting that a transient adaptation of gene expression was mounted. The results
indicate that, depending on the nature of the Fe compound, a specific level of toxicity is induced in
hepatic cells which however can be overcome by establishment of resistance.",1
"Abstract
Fungal endophytes are living inside plants without any harmful effects; the prospecting about them is increased day by day because they can produce bioactive compounds which can be used in different applications. Herein, the current study was aimed to isolate the endophytic fungi from the Ocimum basilicum plant as safe microorganisms and evaluate their biological activities. The results illustrated that three endophytic fungal strains were isolated and identified morphologically and genetically as Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus flavus and deposited in gene bank under accession numbers MZ045561, MZ045562, and MZ045563 respectively. Moreover, cell-free filtrates of endophytic fungal strains were extracted using ethyl acetate, where these crude extracts exhibited promising antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Candida albicans at a concentration of 1000 µg/mL. Furthermore, these endophytic strains exhibited a potential antioxidant activity where IC50 of the crude extract of A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus were (166.3, 68.4, and 347.1 µg/mL) and (151.2, 77.9, and 246.3 µg/mL) using DPPH and ABTS methods, respectively. Furthermore, the ethyl acetate crude extracts of these endophytic fungi did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect against Vero and Wi 38 normal cells. GC–MS analysis of the crude extract of A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus indicated the presence of 22, 22, and 20 active compounds, respectively. The major compounds in the fungal extracts are belonging to fatty acids, fatty acid esters, tetrahydrofurans, and sterols. In conclusion, the isolated endophytic A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus from Ocimum basilicum are promising sources for bioactive compounds.

Background
Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown inverse associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk.
Methods
In a multicenter trial in Spain, we assigned 7447 participants (55 to 80 years of age, 57% women) who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was a major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the trial was stopped on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis. In 2013, we reported the results for the primary end point in the Journal. We subsequently identified protocol deviations, including enrollment of household members without randomization, assignment to a study group without randomization of some participants at 1 of 11 study sites, and apparent inconsistent use of randomization tables at another site. We have withdrawn our previously published report and now report revised effect estimates based on analyses that do not rely exclusively on the assumption that all the participants were randomly assigned.
Results
A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants; there were 96 events in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (3.8%), 83 in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (3.4%), and 109 in the control group (4.4%). In the intention-to-treat analysis including all the participants and adjusting for baseline characteristics and propensity scores, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.91) for a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95) for a Mediterranean diet with nuts, as compared with the control diet. Results were similar after the omission of 1588 participants whose study-group assignments were known or suspected to have departed from the protocol.
Conclusions
In this study involving persons at high cardiovascular risk, the incidence of major cardiovascular events was lower among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts than among those assigned to a reduced-fat diet.

Objective: To explore the biomechanical differences between Coflex and X-STOP devices by finite element analysis. Methods: Based on the normal lumbar CT images from a healthy adult volunteer, four finite element models including the healthy lumbar segment model, the mild degenerated lumbar segment model, a Coflex fixed lumbar segment model and X-STOP fixed lumbar segment model were constructed. A simulation analysis under the conditions of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation was performed to compare range of motion (ROM), intradiscal pressure, the facet joint force, the maximum Von Mises stress and the peak facet contact forces, between Coflex and X-STOP devices. Results: Compared to the mild degenerated lumbar segment model at surgical level L4-L5, Coflex and X-STOP could reduce ROM in extension by 98.34% and 95.86%, respectively, decrease peak stress of intervertebral discs in extension by 59.4% and 66.17%, respectively, and release peak force of facet joint in extension by 97.09% and 95.42%, respectively. Both devices had no significant impact on adjacent levels. The maximum Von Mises stress in Coflex device was 637.56 Mpa in flexion, 528.86 Mpa in extension, while the maximum Von Mises stress in X-STOP device was 476.65 Mpa at extension position. The peak facet contact forces of Coflex and X-STOP devices appeared in extension and were 19.76 Mpa and 49.28 Mpa, respectively. Conclusions: Coflex and X-STOP devices can effectively decrease the ROM and intradiscal pressure in extension, without affecting the adjacent levels.",1

Background:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with an increased risk of developing several common cancers, but it is unclear whether this association is causal. We aimed to summarize the evidence on T2DM and cancer and evaluate the validity of associations from both observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.

Methods:
We performed an umbrella review of the evidence across meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations of T2DM with risk of developing or dying from site-specific cancers, and MR studies that explored the potential causal association of T2DM and associated biomarkers with cancer risk.

Results:
We identified eligible observational meta-analyses that assessed associations between T2DM and cancer incidence for 18 cancer sites, cancer mortality for seven sites, and cancer incidence or mortality for four sites. Positive associations between T2DM and six cancers reached strong or highly suggestive evidence. We found eight MR studies assessing the association of genetically predicted T2DM and seven and eight studies assessing the association of genetically predicted fasting insulin or fasting glucose concentrations, respectively, upon site-specific cancers. Positive associations were found between genetically predicted T2DM and fasting insulin and risk of six cancers. There was no association between genetically predicted fasting plasma glucose and cancer except for squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Conclusions:
We found robust observational evidence for the association between T2DM and colorectal, hepatocellular, gallbladder, breast, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers.",1

Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination targeting Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). It is approved in adult patients for complicated urinary tract
infections (cUTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) as well as for nosocomial pneumonia. It displays excellent activity against PA, even multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drugresistant (XDR) strains. The aim of this systematic review (PROSPERO protocol no. CRD42019117350)
was to summarise the available evidence from observational studies regarding the efficacy and safety
of off-label use of C/T when administered to treat MDR- or XDR-PA infections. The MEDLINE and Embase databases were screened from inception up to 30 June 2019. Studies were deemed eligible if they
described real-life use of C/T in the case of MDR- or XDR-PA infections for non-approved indications. Exclusion criteria were cIAIs, cUTIs, pneumonia (unless occurring in a paediatric population) and infections
by non-MDR/XDR-PA. Thirty articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In total, 130 cases of MDR- or XDR-PA
infections treated with C/T in 128 patients were described. The most relevant off-label uses were skin
and soft-tissue infection (49/30; 37.7%), bone and joint infection (42/130; 32.3%) and bloodstream infection (23/130; 17.7%). Five cases involved paediatric patients. The overall clinical success rate was 76.2%.
The most common adverse event was hypokalaemia (4.2%, in 48 evaluable cases). C/T may be a useful
therapeutic option for difficult-to-treat infections by PA even outside the framework of approved indications. Further studies are necessary to better define new indications for the drug.",1

Tars should be removed from biomass gasification systems so as not to damage or clog downstream pipes
or equipment. In this paper, lignite insoluble residue (LIR) after extraction of humic acids was used as the
support to prepare a nickel-loaded LIR (Ni/LIR) catalyst. This novel catalyst Ni/LIR was tested in steam
reforming of toluene as a model compound of biomass tar conducted in a laboratory-scale fixed bed
reactor. When compared to the reactions without catalyst or with Ni/Al2O3, Ni/LIR was confirmed as an
active catalyst for toluene conversion at a relatively low temperature of 900 K. The investigated
reforming parameters during the experiments in this research were selected as reaction temperature at a
range of 850e950 K, steam/carbon molar ratio at a range of 2e5 mol/mol, and a space velocity from 1696
to 3387 h_x0001_1

acceptable Ni/LIR consumption and more than 95% of toluene conversion can be obtained from the
biomass Ni/LIR catalytic gasification system.",1
"Abstract
Tandemly organized rRNA genes are a typical example of a multigene family, where individual members evolve co-ordinately within—but independently between—species due to gene conversion and unequal crossing over. More frequently, in eukaryotic species with an interspecies hybrid origin, expression of unhomogenized rRNA genes from one progenitor is epigenetically silenced because of nucleolus dominance, and distinct rRNA genes may lose functionality and evolve faster. Interestingly, we obtained unusual ribosomal gene sequences from Oryza species that showed great diversity and did not appear in the present rice genomic sequence. The diversity of rDNA sequences indicated that the homogenization in rice is incomplete and explains the introgression of distinct rRNA gene families into ancestral rice genomes before speciation and continent separation. The divergent large subunit (LSU) ribosomal genes are expressed, some of them differentially, depending on the N fertilization of plants. Detection of differential transcripts of the rRNA genes suggested that rRNA gene families are not functionally equivalent. Phylogenetic analysis assigned Oryza species branching order to monocots, and monocot lineages probably have the same ecological origin by molecular clock calculation. Therefore, our results suggested that the geographical distances of continent-separation cause barriers to the gene flow and homogenization among Oryza species which requires further explanation.

"Summary
Kinesin-2 motors, which are involved in intraflagellar transport and cargo transport along cytoplasmic microtubules, differ from motors in the canonical kinesin-1 family by having a heterodimeric rather than homodimeric structure and possessing a three amino acid insertion in their neck linker domain. To determine how these structural features alter the chemomechanical coupling in kinesin-2, we used single-molecule bead experiments to measure the processivity and velocity of mouse kinesin-2 heterodimer (KIF3A/B) and the engineered homodimers KIF3A/A and KIF3B/B and compared their behavior to Drosophila kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC). Single-motor run lengths of kinesin-2 were 4-fold shorter than those of kinesin-1. Extending the kinesin-1 neck linker by three amino acids led to a similar reduction in processivity. Furthermore, kinesin-2 processivity varied inversely with ATP concentration. Stochastic simulations of the kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 hydrolysis cycles suggest that “front-head gating,” in which rearward tension prevents ATP binding to the front head when both heads are bound to the microtubule, is diminished in kinesin-2. Because the mechanical tension that underlies front-head gating must be transmitted through the neck linker domains, we propose that the diminished coordination in kinesin-2 is a result of its longer and, hence, more compliant neck linker element.",1
"Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) can phosphorylate
and degrade β-catenin, and negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. MiR-224
up-regulation is associated with colorectal
cancer (CRC). Bioinformatics analysis showed
complementary binding sites between miR-224
and GSK-3β. This study investigated if miR-224
plays a role in mediating GSK-3β expression,
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity, CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis as well as drug sensitivity of
Adriamycin (ADM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual luciferase gene reporter assay demonstrated the regulatory relationship between miR-224 and GSK3β. Expression of miR-224, GSK-3β, β-catenin, and Survivin was measured in normal colon
epithelium NCM460, CRC cell line SW480, and
drug-resistant SW480/ADM cell line. Flow cytometry measured apoptosis under ADM with
an IC50 concentration of SW480 cells, followed
by CCK-8 analysis of cell proliferation. SW480/
ADM cells were treated with miR-224 inhibitor
and/or pSicoR-GSK-3β, followed by analysis of
the expressions of GSK-3β, β-catenin and Survivin, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation by
EdU staining.
RESULTS: MiR-224 targeted and inhibited
GSK-3β expression. In SW480/ADM cells, GSK3β expression and cell apoptosis rate were lower than those in SW480 cells, whilst miR-224,
β-catenin, and Survivin expression or proliferation were higher than those in SW480 cells.
Transfection of miR-224 inhibitor and/or pSicoR-GSK-3β significantly increased GSK-3β expression in SW480/ADM cells, and decreased
β-catenin and Survivin expression, leading to
reduced proliferation potency, enhanced cell
apoptosis and suppressed ADM resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-224 up-regulation is associated with ADM resistance of CRC cells. Suppression of miR-224 expression up-regulated
GSK-3β expression, inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway activity and Survivin expression, as
well as reduced ADM resistance of CRC SW480

Background
Deferiprone is an orally active iron-chelation agent that is being evaluated as a treatment for iron overload in thalassemia major. Studies in an animal model showed that prolonged treatment is associated with a decline in the effectiveness of deferiprone and exacerbation of hepatic fibrosis.
Methods
Hepatic iron stores were determined yearly by chemical analysis of liver-biopsy specimens, magnetic susceptometry, or both. Three hepatopathologists who were unaware of the patients' clinical status, the time at which the specimens were obtained, and the iron content of the specimens examined 72 biopsy specimens from 19 patients treated with deferiprone for more than one year. For comparison, 48 liver-biopsy specimens obtained from 20 patients treated with parenteral deferoxamine for more than one year were similarly reviewed.
Results
Of the 19 patients treated with deferiprone, 18 had received the drug continuously for a mean (±SE) of 4.6±0.3 years. At the final analysis, 7 of the 18 had hepatic iron concentrations of at least 80 μmol per gram of liver, wet weight (the value above which there is an increased risk of cardiac disease and early death in patients with thalassemia major). Of 19 patients in whom multiple biopsies were performed over a period of more than one year, 14 could be evaluated for progression of hepatic fibrosis; of the 20 deferoxamine-treated patients, 12 could be evaluated for progression. Five deferiprone-treated patients had progression of fibrosis, as compared with none of those given deferoxamine (P=0.04). By the life-table method, we estimated that the median time to progression of fibrosis was 3.2 years in deferiprone-treated patients. After adjustment for the initial hepatic iron concentration, the estimated odds of progression of fibrosis increased by a factor of 5.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 29.6) with each additional year of deferiprone treatment.
Conclusions
Deferiprone does not adequately control body iron burden in patients with thalassemia and may worsen hepatic fibrosis.",1
"Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has pleiotropic immune functions in a number of inflammatory diseases. Recent evidence from expression and functional studies has indicated that MIF is involved in various aspects of cardiovascular disease. In this study, we aimed to determine whether MIF supports in vitro c-kit+CD45- cardiac stem cell (CSC) survival, proliferation and differentiation into endothelial cells, as well as the possible mechanisms involved. We observed MIF receptor (CD74) expression in mouse CSCs (mCSCs) using PCR and immunofluorescence staining, and MIF secretion by mCSCs using PCR and ELISA in vitro. Increasing amounts of exogenous MIF did not affect CD74 expression, but promoted mCSC survival, proliferation and endothelial differentiation. By contrast, treatment with an MIF inhibitor (ISO-1) or siRNA targeting CD74 (CD74‑siRNA) suppressed the biological changes induced by MIF in the mCSCs. Increasing amounts of MIF increased the phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which are known to support cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. These effects of MIF on the mCSCs were abolished by LY294002 [a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor] and MK-2206 (an Akt inhibitor). Moreover, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation increased following treatment with MIF. The AMPK inhibitor, compound C, partly blocked the pro-proliferative effects of MIF on the mCSCs. In conclusion, our results suggest that MIF promotes mCSC survival, proliferation and endothelial differentiation through the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and AMPK signaling pathways. Thus, MIF may prove to be a potential therapeutic factor in the treatment of heart failure and myocardial infarction by activating CSCs.",1

Background
A central nosological problem concerns the etiological relationship of emotional dysregulation with ADHD. Molecular genetic risk scores provide a novel method for informing this question.

Methods
Participants were 514 community-recruited children of Northern European descent age 7-11 defined as ADHD or non-ADHD by detailed research evaluation. Parents-rated ADHD on standardized ratings and child temperament on the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ) and reported on ADHD and comorbid disorders by semi-structured clinical interview. Categorical and dimensional variables were created for ADHD, emotional dysregulation (implicating disruption of regulation of both anger-irritability and of positive valence surgency-sensation seeking), and irritability alone (anger dysregulation). Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) were computed for ADHD and depression genetic liability. Structural equation models and computationally derived emotion profiles guided analysis.

Results
The ADHD PRS was associated in variable-centered analyses with irritability (β = .179, 95% CI = 0.087–0.280; ΔR2 = .034, p < .0002), but also with surgency/sensation seeking (B = .146, 95%CI = 0.052–0.240, ΔR2=.022, p = .002). In person-centered analysis, the ADHD PRS was elevated in the emotion dysregulation ADHD group versus other ADHD children (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.03–2.20, Nagelkerke ΔR2 = .013, p = .033) but did not differentiate irritable from surgent ADHD profiles. All effects were independent of variation in ADHD severity across traits or groups. The depression PRS was related to oppositional defiant disorder but not to ADHD emotion dysregulation.

Conclusions
Irritability-anger and surgency-sensation seeking, as forms of negative and positively valenced dysregulated affect in ADHD populations, both relate principally to ADHD genetic risk and not mood-related genetic risk.",1
"ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: To provide in vitro evidence of Psorinum treatment against cancer cells in a controlled study.
METHODS: Effects of homeopathic Psorinum 6× on cell viability were initially determined in
several cancer cell lines, including A549, HepG2 and MCF-7, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and an ethanol 6× control. The cell line that exhibited highest
inhibition was selected and used in the following experiments. A range of Psorinum 6× doses was used
to explore treatment effects on cell cycle arrest, cell death (apoptosis), generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using flow cytometry and
fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Expression of several signal proteins related to apoptosis and
cell survival were quantified with Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Further, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy was used to determine possible drug-DNA interactions, as well as the induction of
conformational changes.
RESULTS: Treatment of cancer cell lines with Psorinum showed greater anticancer effects in A549 cells
than in others. In A549 cells Psorinum treatment inhibited cell proliferation at 24 h after treatment, and
arrested cell cycle at sub-G1 stage. It also induced ROS generation, MMP depolarization, morphological
changes and DNA damage, as well as externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Further, increases in p53
expression, Bax expression, cytochrome c release, along with reduction of Bcl-2 level and caspase-3
activation were observed after Psorinum 6× treatment, which eventually drove A549 cells towards the
mitochondria-mediated caspase-3-dependent pathway. CD spectroscopy revealed direct interaction of
Psorinum with DNA, using calf thymus-DNA as target.
CONCLUSION: Psorinum 6× triggered apoptosis in A549 cells via both up- and down-regulations of
relevant signal proteins, including p53, caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2.

"Abstract Quantum key distribution (QKD) based on the laws of quantum physics allows the secure distribution of
secret keys over an insecure channel. Unfortunately, imperfect implementations of QKD compromise its
information-theoretical security. Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD)
is a promising approach to remove all side channels from the measurement unit, which is regarded as the
“Achilles’ heel” of QKD. An essential assumption in MDI QKD is, however, that the sources are trusted.
Here we experimentally demonstrate that a practical source based on a semiconductor laser diode is vulnerable to a laser-seeding attack, in which light injected from the communication line into the laser results
in an increase of the intensities of the prepared states. The unnoticed increase of intensity may compromise
the security of QKD, as we show theoretically for the prepare-and-measure decoy-state BB84 and MDI
QKD protocols. Our theoretical security analysis is general and can be applied to any vulnerability that
increases the intensity of the emitted pulses. Moreover, a laser-seeding attack might be launched as well
against decoy-state-based quantum cryptographic protocols beyond QKD.",1

Background
A huge reservoir was formed by the Three Gorges Dam in China, which also formed a riparian zone along the bank of the reservoir. In the period of low water-level, the riparian zone in tributary bays of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) was always unordered cultivated, owing to its gentle slope and high soil fertility. This land-use practice creates high potential of generating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with periodic water level fluctuation.

Methods
To evaluate potential GHG emissions from the soil-air interface, the static opaque chamber method was adopted to evaluate the effect of elevations (180 m, 175 m, 170 m and 165 m) and land use types (dry lands, paddy fields and grass fields) from April to September in 2015 and 2016.

Results
The results showed that carbon dioxide (CO2) was the main contributor of GHG emission in riparian zone most likely because of high organic carbon from residues. Furthermore, high soil water content in paddy fields resulted in significantly higher methane (CH4) flux than that in dry lands and grass fields. Compared to grass fields, anthropogenic activities in croplands were attributed with a decrease of soil total carbon and GHG emissions. However, inundation duration of different elevations was found to have no significant effect on CH4 and CO2 emissions in the riparian zone, and the mean nitrous oxide (N2O) flux from dry lands at an elevation of 165 m was significantly higher than that of other elevations likely because of tillage and manure application. The high N2O fluxes produced from tillage and fertilizer suggested that, in order to potentially mitigate GHG emissions from the riparian zone, more attention must be paid to the farming practices in dry lands at low elevations (below 165 m) in the riparian zone. Understanding factors that contribute to GHG emissions will help guide ecological restoration of riparian zones in the TGR.",1
"AbstractThe incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) con-tinues to increase worldwide. Furthermore, a considerable fraction of in-dividuals with IBD do not respond effectively to conventional treatments, suggesting a need for new therapeutic strategies. Butyrate and palmitoy-lethanolamide (PEA) are individually recognised for their protective effect on the gut epithelial permeability barrier. In this study, VitroScreen ORA™ intestinal 3D scaffold-free spheroids were used to mirror in vitro a model of an inflamed colonic epithelium and to investigate, in a preliminary setting, the protective mechanisms of a synergistic blend of butyrate and PEA. Spheroids were produced using human colonic fibroblasts and primary epithelial colonic cells. Differentiated spheroids were pretreated with ei-ther mesalamine, butyrate, PEA, or a blend of butyrate and PEA in a 3:1 ratio. To evaluate the protective effect of these molecules, a stimulation with interleukin 1β or with dextran sodium sulfate was applied to induce a pro-inflammatory status and epithelial damage respectively. ELISA assay and immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the inflamma-tory status and epithelium integrity. Butyrate mitigated the expression and release of interleukin-1β while PEA increased zonula occludens-1 ex-pression. Treatment with the blend consisting of butyrate and PEA showed a synergistic effect on tight junctions in terms of zonula occludens-1 in-creased expression and improved localization. Our preliminary data are promising, suggesting an application of ORA™ intestinal spheroids as an innovative platform with the ability to mirror gut inflammatory status. Furthermore, the results suggest a novel application of butyrate and PEA in clinical practice to better manage pathogenesis and flare-ups of IBD.Keywords:3D scaffold-free spheroids, inflammatory bowel disease, palmitoylethanolamide, butyrate, mesalamine, tight junctionsMarco Valente1*Francesca Rescigno2Stefano Francescato1Sonia Facchin3Edoardo Savarino3Giovanni Baratto11 Food Supplements R&D, Unifarco S.p.A., Santa Giustina, Italy 2 VitroScreen, Milan, Italy3 Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology (DISCOG), University Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy*Corresponding authorMarco ValenteEmail: marco.valente@unifarco.it Tel.: +39 04371943715",1
"African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is systematic, rooted
in history, and important as an identity marker and expressive
resource for its speakers. In these respects, it resembles other
vernacular or nonstandard varieties, like Cockney or Appalachian
English. But like them, AAVE can trigger discrimination in the
workplace, housing market, and schools. Understanding what shapes
the relative use of AAVE vs. Standard American English (SAE) is
important for policy and scientific reasons. This work presents, to our
knowledge, the first experimental estimates of the effects of moving
into lower-poverty neighborhoods on AAVE use. We use data on
non-Hispanic African-American youth (n = 629) from a large-scale,
randomized residential mobility experiment called Moving to Opportunity (MTO), which enrolled a sample of mostly minority families originally living in distressed public housing. Audio recordings
of the youth were transcribed and coded for the use of five grammatical and five phonological AAVE features to construct a measure of the proportion of possible instances, or tokens, in which
speakers use AAVE rather than SAE speech features. Random assignment to receive a housing voucher to move into a lower-poverty
area (the intention-to-treat effect) led youth to live in neighborhoods
(census tracts) with an 11 percentage point lower poverty rate on
average over the next 10–15 y and reduced the share of AAVE tokens
by ∼3 percentage points compared with the MTO control group
youth. The MTO effect on AAVE use equals approximately half of
the difference in AAVE frequency observed between youth whose
parents have a high school diploma and those whose parents do not.",1
"Summary
In plants and algae, chloroplast gene expression is controlled by nucleus-encoded proteins that bind to mRNAs in a specific manner, stabilizing mRNAs or promoting their splicing, editing, or translation. Here, we present the characterization of two mRNA stabilization factors of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which both belong to the OctotricoPeptide Repeat (OPR) family. MCG1 is necessary to stabilize the petG mRNA, encoding a small subunit of the cytochrome b6f complex, while MBI1 stabilizes the psbI mRNA, coding for a small subunit of photosystem II. In the mcg1 mutant, the small RNA footprint corresponding to the 5′-end of the petG transcript is reduced in abundance. In both cases, the absence of the small subunit perturbs assembly of the cognate complex. Whereas PetG is essential for formation of a functional cytochrome b6f dimer, PsbI appears partly dispensable as a low level of PSII activity can still be measured in its absence. Thus, nuclear control of chloroplast gene expression is not only exerted on the major core subunits of the complexes, but also on small subunits with a single transmembrane helix. While OPR proteins have thus far been involved in translation or trans-splicing of plastid mRNAs, our results expand the potential roles of this repeat family to their stabilization.",1
"ABSTRACT
A simple, scalable, novel polymer was synthesized by the aminolysis of poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) cumene terminated (PSMAC) using p-aminohippuric acid. The main objective was to perceive the effect of blend
ratio of polysulfone (PSF) and poly[styrene-alt-(N-4-benzoylglycine-maleamic acid)] cumene terminated (PAH)
on morphology and permeation properties of the membranes. The PSF/PAH blend membranes unveiled enriched
hydrophilicity, porosity, zeta potential, water uptake and permeability owing to the existence of the hydrophilic
PAH. However, the contact angle was not diminished over 20% of PAH ratio as there was an increase of hydrophobic alkyl group density. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed for the determination of
the glass transition temperature of the blends and the results revealed that the polymer blend is miscible in
nature. Moreover, the M-3 membrane was screened for the heavy metal ion removal and achieved removal of
91.5% of Pb2+ and 72.3% of Cd2+ ions, respectively. The adsorption parameters indicated that the Langmuir
isotherm model fits well for both Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions adsorption on M-3 membrane. The adsorption capacity
attained from Langmuir isotherm model was 19.35 and 9.88 mg/g for Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions correspondingly",1
"Abstract
Massive changes in the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana during onset and progression of leaf senescence imply a central role for transcription factors. While many transcription factors are themselves up- or down-regulated during senescence, the bZIP transcription factor G-box-binding factor 1 (GBF1/bZIP41) is constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis leaf tissue but at the same time triggers the onset of leaf senescence, suggesting posttranscriptional mechanisms for senescence-specific GBF1 activation. Here we show that GBF1 is phosphorylated by the threonine/serine CASEIN KINASE II (CKII) in vitro and that CKII phosphorylation had a negative effect on GBF1 DNA-binding to G-boxes of two direct target genes, CATALASE2 and RBSCS1a. Phosphorylation mimicry at three serine positions in the basic region of GBF1 also had a negative effect on DNA-binding. Kinase assays revealed that CKII phosphorylates at least one serine in the basic domain but has additional phosphorylation sites outside this domain. Two different ckII α subunit1 and one α subunit2 T-DNA insertion lines showed no visible senescence phenotype, but in all lines the expression of the senescence marker gene SAG12 was remarkably diminished. A model is presented suggesting that senescence-specific GBF1 activation might be achieved by lowering the phosphorylation of GBF1 by CKII.

Background
Several treatments are available for treatment of early and very early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma, also known as small Hepatocellular Carcinoma (SHCC). However, there is no consensus with regards to the efficacies of these methods. We aimed at identifying the most effective initial treatment strategy for SHCC through Bayesian network meta-analyses.

Methods
Studies published between January, 2010, and February, 2021 were searched in EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of science databases, and conference proceedings for trials. The included studies reported the survival outcomes of very early and early Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients subjected to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), surgical resection (SR), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), minimally invasive liver surgery (MIS), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and cryoablation (CA). Then, data were extracted from studies that met the inclusion criteria. Patient survival data were retrieved from the published Kaplan–Meier curves and pooled. A Bayesian random-effects model was used to combine direct and indirect evidence.

Results
A total of 2058 articles were retrieved and screened, from which 45 studies assessing the efficacies of 8 different treatments in 11,364 patients were selected. The included studies had high methodological quality. Recurrence free survival* (progression/recurrence/relapse/disease/tumor-free survival were combined and redefined as RFS*) and overall survival (OS) outcomes were highest in MIS-treated patients (HR 0·57, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0·38–0·85; HR 0.48,95% CI 0.36–0.64, respectively), followed by SR-treated patients (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.74; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55–0.72, respectively). TACE was highly efficacious (58.9%) at decreasing the rates of major complications. Similar findings were obtained through sensitivity analysis, and in most of the prognostic subgroups.

Conclusions
MIS and SR exhibited the highest clinical efficacies, however, they were associated with higher rates of complications. Ablation is effective in small tumors, whereas SBRT is a relatively promising treatment option for SHCC. More well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials should be performed to validate our findings.",1
"Abstract
Mcm10 is an essential eukaryotic factor required for DNA replication. The replication fork helicase is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2–7 and GINS (CMG). DDK is an S-phase-specific kinase required for replication initiation, and the DNA primase-polymerase in eukaryotes is pol α. Mcm10 forms oligomers in vitro, mediated by the coiled-coil domain at the N-terminal region of the protein. We characterized an Mcm10 mutant at the N-terminal Domain (NTD), Mcm10-4A, defective for self-interaction. We found that the Mcm10-4A mutant was defective for stimulating DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2, binding to eighty-nucleotide ssDNA, and recruiting pol α to Mcm2–7 in vitro. Expression of wild-type levels of mcm10-4A resulted in severe growth and DNA replication defects in budding yeast cells, with diminished DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2. We then expressed the mcm10-4A in mcm5-bob1 mutant cells to bypass the defects mediated by diminished stimulation of DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2. Expression of wild-type levels of mcm10-4A in mcm5-bob1 mutant cells resulted in severe growth and DNA replication defects, along with diminished RPA signal at replication origins. We also detected diminished GINS and pol-α recruitment to the Mcm2–7 complex. We conclude that an intact Mcm10 coiled-coil interaction surface is important for origin melting, helicase assembly, and the recruitment of pol α to Mcm2–7.",1
"Abstract
Differences in general cognitive function have been shown to be partly heritable and to show genetic correlations with several psychiatric and physical disease states. However, to date, few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have demonstrated genome-wide significance, hampering efforts aimed at determining which genetic variants are most important for cognitive function and which regions drive the genetic associations between cognitive function and disease states. Here, we combine multiple large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, from the CHARGE cognitive consortium (n=53 949) and UK Biobank (n=36 035), to partition the genome into 52 functional annotations and an additional 10 annotations describing tissue-specific histone marks. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression we show that, in two measures of cognitive function, SNPs associated with cognitive function cluster in regions of the genome that are under evolutionary negative selective pressure. These conserved regions contained ~2.6% of the SNPs from each GWAS but accounted for ~40% of the SNP-based heritability. The results suggest that the search for causal variants associated with cognitive function, and those variants that exert a pleiotropic effect between cognitive function and health, will be facilitated by examining these enriched regions.

"Methods
Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of UBE2T in the CRC tissues and cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining, spearman correlation analysis, and Kaplan Meier-survival analysis were used to demonstrate the correlation between UBE2T high expression level and the clinical characteristics of malignant patients and the overall survival. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of CRC cells were analyzed by cell transfection, MTT, colony formation, scratch assay, transwell, and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the expression of cell proliferation and apoptosis related proteins and ubiquitination of p53 were detected by western blot.
Results
UBE2T was up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and high expression level of UBE2T was correlated with the clinical characteristics of malignant of CRC patients (P < 0.05), and patients with high expression level of UBE2T had lower overall survival (P = 0.0455). In addition, UBE2T could promote the growth, proliferation, invasion and metastasis of CRC cells and inhibit the apoptosis. At the same time, knockdown of UBE2T inhibited the growth of transplanted tumor in mice of subcutaneous CRC model. Moreover, our experimental results proved that UBE2T regulated the expression of downstream related proteins through ubiquitination of p53 protein to promote the occurrence and development of CRC.
Conclusion
Our study elucidated that high expression of UBE2T would enhance the development of CRC, and then further explored its molecular mechanism both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that UBE2T facilitated ubiquitination and degradation of p53, which predicts the possibility of UBE2T as one of molecular diagnosis markers, prognostic indicators and therapeutic drug targets of CRC patients.
